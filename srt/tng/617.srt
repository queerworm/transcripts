<i>Last time on</i> Star Trek:
The Next Generation...

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,417
Not all the Klingons
at Khitomer

3
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,667
were killed
during the massacre.

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,917
Many were captured
by the Romulans

5
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:14,917
and placed in a prison camp
on a remote planet.

6
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:16,834
Your father was among them.

7
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,667
If my father were alive,
it would dishonor his sons

8
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:21,667
and their sons
for three generations.

9
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:24,000
Even Alexander would bear
the burden of guilt.

10
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:27,542
So you're willing
to ignore the possibility

11
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,959
because you're concerned
about dishonor?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,875
My father is dead.

13
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:34,834
That Yridian
is selling lies.

14
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,291
This is a homing device.

15
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,250
It will allow you to find
my ship when I return.

16
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,458
You are Klingon.
Where did you come from?

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,834
That does not matter.

18
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,500
I have come
to take you home.

19
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:55,000
He must leave at once.

20
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,000
No, it is too late for that now.
He would bring others.

21
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,792
<i>Vang ghaH!</i>

22
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:07,208
We are not
leaving here

23
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,875
and neither
are you.

24
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:12,583
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

25
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,250
Take his pack.

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,542
Are you afraid to die
while escaping?

27
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,333
We are dead, Worf.

28
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,875
We died at Khitomer.

29
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:29,166
We were captured.
It was worse than death.

30
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,291
Well, why did you
allow it to happen?

31
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,667
We had no choice.

32
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:36,542
We were defending an outpost
on the perimeter.

33
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,750
The Romulans
took out our shields.

34
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:41,667
The next blast
rendered us unconscious.

35
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:44,834
And when we awoke,
we were prisoners,

36
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,792
unarmed and shackled.

37
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,542
We were interrogated
for three months.

38
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,625
We tried to
starve ourselves,

39
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,375
but they
kept us alive.

40
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:58,166
The Romulan Commander, Tokath,
thought he was being kind.

41
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,208
The Romulans
hoped to trade our lives

42
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,750
for territorial concessions,

43
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:05,208
but the Klingon High Council
refused to negotiate.

44
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,959
They would not acknowledge

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,583
that their warriors
had been taken prisoner.

46
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,625
And when it was clear that
we would be of no use to them,

47
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,166
Tokath offered
to let us go.

48
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,625
But we knew that
our families believed

49
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,500
we had fallen in battle,

50
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:23,583
so we did not wish
to return to dishonor them.

51
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:27,125
We asked Tokath to let us stay
and he took pity on us.

52
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,291
I understand your desire

53
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,417
to preserve
your family's honor.

54
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,834
But what of your own?

55
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,750
There is no honor
in remaining prisoners.

56
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:43,041
We lost our honor
when we were captured.

57
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,333
It does not matter
what happens to us.

58
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,792
All that matters

59
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,417
is that our families
are not dishonored.

60
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,166
Why did you
come here, Worf?

61
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,125
If you had
found your father,

62
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:01,125
you would have found
only dishonor.

63
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,875
If he had been captured,
as you were--

64
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:09,667
if I had
found him here--

65
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,625
I would be glad
to see him.

66
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:16,667
There is no room
in my heart for shame.

67
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,625
I can only hope
that if my son came here,

68
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:25,500
he would be Klingon enough
to kill me.

69
00:03:55,792 --> 00:04:00,000
PICARD:

(<i> quiet conversations</i> )

76
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,250
This is a<i> gin'tak</i> spear.
What of it?

77
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,834
Have your parents
taught you nothing?

78
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,834
This is used for battle,
not tilling soil.

79
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,041
We have no need
for weapons here.

80
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,375
The war is far away.

81
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,291
What war?

82
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,166
The war our parents
came here to escape.

83
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,917
That war was over
many years ago.

84
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,834
I'm not interested in what
you have to say, Klingon.

85
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,417
I've got work to do.

86
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,375
Hello again, Worf.

87
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:29,000
They say you've come
to stay with us.

88
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,917
Not by choice.

89
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,208
Well, aren't you happy
to have escaped the war?

90
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,917
The war.

91
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,458
Yes.

92
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,917
We've heard the stories
all our lives.

93
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,875
How people are slaughtered
in terrible battles--

94
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,625
forced to fight whether
they want to or not.

95
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,208
And that's why our
parents came here--

96
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,834
to make a safe home

97
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,000
a place where they could
raise their children in peace.

98
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,000
I should think
you'd be relieved

99
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,083
to get away from the fighting,
you're safe here.

100
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,917
A place can be safe
and still be a prison.

101
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,750
Where I come from,

102
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:05,750
people are free to
come and go as they choose.

103
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,000
So are we.

104
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,834
Tell your father that you
would like to leave.

105
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,000
Tell him that you
would like to visit

106
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,542
the Klingon homeworld.

107
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,333
See what he says.

108
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,417
Why would I want to go there?
It's dangerous.

109
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,709
Not any longer.

110
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,542
WOMAN:
Ba'el. Come here.

111
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,333
Yes, Mother.

112
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,083
You are not allowed
to leave the compound?

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,041
Then I suppose I won't be
seeing you at the pond again.

114
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,458
I told you not to
speak with him.

115
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,583
I'm sorry, Mother.

116
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,625

117
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,000

(<i> knocking at door</i> )

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,750
Enter.

121
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I am Tokath.

122
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:07,417
I can return later
if I'm disturbing you.

123
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:13,291
It is a strange thing when
the jailer concerns himself

124
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,625
with his
prisoner's comfort.

125
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,125
Mine is a strange prison.

126
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,500
You robbed the Klingons
of who they were.

127
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,917
You dishonored them.

128
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,291
By not slitting their throats
when we found them unconscious?

129
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,750
I do not expect you
to understand.

130
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:35,959
You are a Romulan.

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,583
(<i> sighs</i> )

132
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,667
You're just like
L'Kor was 20 years ago--

133
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,000
proud and angry.

134
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,041
He hated me.

135
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,583
All the Klingons did.

136
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,375
And I had
no love for them.

137
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:49,667
I won't deny it.

138
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:52,709
When I informed
the High Command

139
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,375
that the Klingons
wanted to remain here,

140
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:58,542
I was told
that unless I stayed

141
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,667
to oversee them myself,

142
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:03,959
they would be killed.

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,375
My decision ended
my military career.

144
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,875
Why did you do it?

145
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:12,959
I don't expect you
to understand.

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,917
You're a Klingon.

147
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,917
But I do expect you
to understand this.

148
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,583
We've put aside
the old hatreds.

149
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:27,333
Here, Romulans and Klingons
live in peace.

150
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:32,208
I won't allow you
to destroy what we have.

151
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,250
Do not deceive yourself.

152
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,542
These people
are<i> not</i> happy here.

153
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,667
I see the sadness
in their eyes.

154
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:50,583
That's not what I see
when I look in my wife's eyes.

155
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,500
I married a Klingon.

156
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:56,834
So you see, when I warn you
not to disrupt our lives here,

157
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,625
I'm not speaking
just as a jailer,

158
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:03,917
but as a man
protecting his family.

159
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,875

my tolerance.

Find out what they know
about this Yridian trader.

175
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:52,083
Hopefully, he filed
a flight plan before
he left the station.

It's the only chance
we have of finding Worf.

00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:04,166
for a long time.

179
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,834
It implants a small
boridium pellet

180
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,667
underneath the skin.

181
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:14,709
We can use its energy
signature to track you.

182
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,667
In time, you will grow
accustomed to life here.

183
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,166
Never.

184
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,000
He is one of yours,

185
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,417
deal with him
however you like.

186
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,375
But I warn you,
if he becomes a disruption,

187
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:33,166
I will not be
so tolerant.

188
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,834
Toq.

189
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,125
You guard him.

190
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,792
He is free to move around
inside the compound,

191
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:48,291
but make certain
he does not cause trouble.

192
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,834
What are you doing?

193
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,083
This is the<i> mok'bara.</i>

194
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,834
The form clears the mind...

195
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,542
and centers the body.

196
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:20,208
No. Like this.

197
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,750
First, you must learn
how to breathe.

198
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:26,458
Stand tall,
as tall as you can.

199
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,000
Now, take a wider stance.

200
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,083
You must stop.

201
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:38,000
These forms are the basis
for Klingon combat.

202
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,458
You would be wise
to learn them.

203
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,041
I will teach you.

204
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,542
Join us.

205
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,667
We'll see what L'Kor
thinks of this.

206
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,500
Mother?

207
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,875
She's not here.

208
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:07,083
Come in.

209
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,250
This is what
I wanted to show you.

210
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,834
I don't know why,

211
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,458
but I'm not supposed
to look at these things.

212
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,083
They're Klingon,
aren't they?

213
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,041
Yes.

214
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,083
I thought you might be able
to tell me about them.

215
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:30,333
This is
a warrior's armor.

216
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,583
And this is a<i> d'k tahg.</i>

217
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,583
It should not be allowed
to rust like this.

218
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,166
Isn't it beautiful?

219
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,917
That is a<i> jinaq.</i>

220
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:01,917
It is given to a daughter
who has come of age...

221
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:05,250
old enough
to take a mate.

222
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,083
Ba'el!
Mother...

223
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,625
Put that away at once.

224
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:13,417
Why is she forbidden
to know what these things are?

225
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,333
They are not needed here.

226
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,500
Go!

227
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:44,917
Kahless held his father's
lifeless body in his arms.

228
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:48,166
He could not believe
what his brother had done.

229
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:52,500
Then, his brother threw their
father's sword into the sea,

230
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:55,834
saying if he
could not possess it,

231
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:59,667
neither would Kahless.

232
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,417
That was the last time
the brothers would speak.

233
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,291
What happened to the sword?

234
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,250
Kahless looked
into the sea

235
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,625
and wept,

236
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:13,750
for the sword was all
he had left of his father.

237
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,166
The ocean filled
with his tears

238
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,375
and flooded
over the shore.

239
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,041
That is impossible.

240
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:25,417
For you, perhaps.

241
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,417
Not Kahless.
He was a great warrior.

242
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,375
You're making it up.

243
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:31,959
No.

244
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,083
These are our stories.

245
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,417
They tell us who we are.

246
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,834
It is late.

247
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,417
It is time to sleep.

248
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,875
BA'EL:
Worf.

249
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:09,834
You never answered
my question.

250
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,000
Did Kahless ever find
his father's sword?

251
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,250
Yes.
He found it.

252
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,166
The stories that you tell...

253
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,583
are they true?

254
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,542
I have studied them
all of my life

255
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:28,709
and find new truths
in them every time.

256
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,667
This Kahless...

257
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,458
did he ever...

258
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,542
take a mate?

259
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,125
That is another story.

260
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,417
Tell me.

261
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:03,375
You are Romulan.

262
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,125
Tokath is my father.

263
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,000
I thought you knew that.

264
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,625
How could your mother
mate with a Romulan?

265
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:20,041
Why shouldn't she?
It is an obscenity.

266
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,917
What are you saying?
They love each other.

267
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,875
Romulans
are treacherous.

268
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:26,375
Deceitful.

269
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,291
They are without honor.

270
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,500
My father
is a good man.

271
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,667
He is kind and generous.

272
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:37,917
There is nothing
dishonorable about him.

273
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,542
He took part in a cowardly
attack at Khitomer.

274
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,125
Thousands of Klingons
were massacred,

275
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,458
many of them women
and children.

276
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,583
I don't know what
you're talking about.

277
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,208
My father came here
to escape the wars.

278
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,583
He would never kill anybody.

279
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,125
Ask him.
Ask your mother.

280
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,500
Tell them you want
to know the truth.

281
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,291
What is it,
Number One?

282
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,625
We just received
the Yridian's flight plan

283
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:19,208
from Deep Space Nine.

284
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,792
He gets around.

285
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:23,041
He's been to three different
systems in this past week.

286
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,250
He could have left Worf
at any one of them.

287
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,834
Are any of these systems
near Romulan space?

288
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,375
Two of them--

289
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:32,333
the Nequencia
and the Carraya systems.

290
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,458
Let's head
for the closer one.
Aye, sir.

291
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,375
(<i> knocking</i> )

292
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,625
What do you want?

293
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:50,750
I am...
sorry if I upset you.

294
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,875
I was surprised.

295
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:04,208
I became angry.

296
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,041
But I do not
blame you.

297
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,041
You cannot help
being what you are.

298
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,333
There is nothing wrong
with what I am.

299
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:15,083
What I mean is...
it is not your fault.

300
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,458
What, being born?

301
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,959
I'm sorry if that
offends you.

302
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,875
No.

303
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:23,542
It is hard to explain.

304
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,375
Klingons and Romulans
are blood enemies.

305
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:27,542
Have been for centuries.

306
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,875
Not here.
Here we live in peace.

307
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:32,125
But<i> I</i> don't live here.

308
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,291
Worf...

309
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:38,333
before you knew,
you were attracted to me.

310
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,750
Can't you leave
the hatred behind, too?

311
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:43,917
Can't you accept me
as I am?

312
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,875
I, I do not know.

313
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,083
It's set.
It's set.

314
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,083
Come on.

315
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,542
MAN:
Come on, Toq.

316
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,417
Hey!

317
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,750
WOMAN:
Nice.

318
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:16,667
MAN:
Very good.

319
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:21,291
Who's next?
Who's next?

320
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,208
MAN #2:
It's Toq again.

321
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,291
MAN:
Toq again?

322
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,417
MAN #2:
Uh-huh.

323
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,667
Here, Toq.

324
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:29,417
MAN #2:
Okay?

325
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,375
Let's see.

326
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:31,583
MAN:
Try again, Toq.

327
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:32,834
WOMAN:
Pick it up!

328
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:50,709
<i>Ka'la!</i>

329
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,000
That is not how you play
this game.

330
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:56,083
The<i> Qa'Vak</i> is not a game.

331
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:59,375
It hones the skills
of the hunt.

332
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:01,166
The "hunt"?

333
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,625
We have replicators here.

334
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:06,917
Klingons do not hunt
because they need food.

335
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,625
The hunt is a ritual

336
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,333
that reminds us
of where we come from.

337
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:14,875
I know where I came from--
right here.

338
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,583
It is a difficult skill
to master.

339
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,709
Perhaps you are too young.

340
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,917
Your arm is strong.

341
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:48,166
But you need practice.

342
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,583
Hold your other arm
like this

343
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,709
and aim along it.

344
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,000
Roll.

345
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,500
<i>Ka'la!</i>

346
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,333
You learn quickly.

347
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:07,083
Perhaps it is time

348
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:09,709
to put your skills
to the test.

349
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,500
What do you mean?

350
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:13,291
Come.

351
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,500
I will take you
on the hunt.

352
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:18,333
You are not allowed
to leave the compound.

353
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,166
They won't allow it.

354
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,000
I think they will.

355
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,834
Hunting?

356
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:35,166
Have you lost your mind?

357
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:37,417
The boy can
come with me.

358
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:40,375
I cannot sit in the compound
like an old man.

359
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:42,542
I must practice
my skills.

360
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,458
We can't let you out.

361
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,750
You've already tried
to escape once.

362
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:49,792
I give you my word
as a warrior--

363
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,875
I will not try to escape.

364
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:55,083
Leave us.
We have work to do.

365
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,959
Tokath.

366
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,834
He gave his word.

367
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,500
Are you seriously suggesting
that we open the gates

368
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,000
and let him wander free

369
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:11,083
with only a boy
as his guard?

370
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:14,250
23 years ago,
I gave you my word.

371
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:20,834
In all this time,
have I ever broken it?

372
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:26,125
I told you he was yours
to deal with.

373
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:29,625
If you want
to take this risk,

374
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:32,375
the responsibility
is yours.

375
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,417
You will go with him.

376
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,375
Take a weapon.

377
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:42,875
If he breaks his word
and tries to escape...

378
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:46,917
kill him.

379
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:02,000
He is there.

380
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:06,375
The wind has shifted.
We must wait.

381
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,917
Why?
We're so close.

382
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,125
Never approach
your prey from upwind.

383
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:14,208
The breeze will
carry your scent.

384
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:19,000
The wind is
shifting again.

385
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,583
I can't smell anything.

386
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,375
He is there.

387
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,208
How can you...?

388
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,041
Yes.

389
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,875
I<i> can</i> smell it.

390
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:36,458
Remember the scent.

391
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,166
More than anything else,
it will guide you.

392
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:43,166
Oh, it is strong!

393
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:46,625
I cannot believe
I couldn't smell it before.

394
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,291
Let it work its way
into your blood.

395
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:52,750
I can feel
my heart pounding.

396
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:55,083
Yes.

397
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:59,291
This is the moment
where life and death meet.

398
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:03,250
<i>This</i> is what we are...

399
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:05,375
warriors.

400
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:07,625
I was never taught that.

401
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,709
There is much
you were never taught.

402
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,125
(<i> rustling</i> )

403
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,375
Aren't you hungry, L'Kor?

404
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:45,375
Or are you upset because
your prisoner has not returned?

405
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,500
I should not have sent
the boy with him.

406
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,750
If he has
been hurt, I...

407
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:52,458
Don't worry,
my friend.

408
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,917
They'll come back.

409
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,750
After all,
a warrior keeps his word.

410
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:57,750
Isn't that so?

411
00:29:57,792 --> 00:30:01,041
Father, if I wanted
to visit Romulus

412
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,041
or the Klingon homeworld,

413
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,417
would I be allowed to go?

414
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,667
(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

415
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:10,333
<i>Ka'la!</i>

416
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,542
(<i> angry muttering</i> )

417
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:27,250
Tonight, we eat well.

418
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,583
Get that off my table.

419
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,834
You do not kill an animal
unless you intend to eat it.

420
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,792
Get rid of it.

421
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:42,667
I intend to, Tokath.

422
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,375
But not until it's cooked.

423
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:49,583
(<i> men laughing</i> )

424
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:53,333
Today, I learned
the ritual hunt.

425
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,125
But that is not
all I learned.

426
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:58,959
I discovered that
warrior's blood

427
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,250
runs through my veins.

428
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:04,709
I do not know
how or why,

429
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,208
but we have
forgotten ourselves.

430
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,625
Our stories
are not told.

431
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:14,250
Our songs are not sung.

432
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:17,041
Tonight, as we came home,

433
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,875
we sang a song of victory--

434
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:23,583
a song known only to me
as a lullaby.

435
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,583
But it is
a warrior's song.

436
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:30,625
<i>Bagh Da tuH moh.</i>

437
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:33,417
Fire streaks the heavens.

438
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,417
<i>ChojaH Duh rHo.</i>

439
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:42,834

Well, Worf, you've had quite
an effect on the young people.

457
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:39,834
I have done nothing more
than show them who they are.

458
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:44,667
No, you have shown them
what you want them to be.

459
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:50,375
Tell me this.

460
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:54,458
Do you know of any place,
any time in history

461
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,166
when Klingons and Romulans
have lived together in peace?

462
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,458
We have despised each other,

463
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,875
fought each other
for centuries,

464
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:09,250
except here.

465
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:12,417
On this remote planet,

466
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:17,083
Romulans and Klingons
live together in harmony.

467
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,959
No government...

468
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,959
no leader has ever done
what I have done here.

469
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,041
And what about Toq?

470
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,166
I saw what
happened to him

471
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:34,417
when he caught the scent
of his prey on the wind.

472
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:36,917
For the first time in his
life, he felt powerful,

473
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:39,917
and<i> that</i> is what he has
been denied living here.

474
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:43,542
And<i> that</i> is what you have
tried to take away from him.

475
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,375
Now, you may be
content to sit here

476
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:47,333
in the jungle
and wither to old age,

477
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,208
but Toq and the others

478
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,959
have tasted what it is
to feel truly alive

479
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,166
and they will not
give that up now.

480
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:56,000
Enough of this.

481
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:59,709
We could talk all night
and<i> not</i> convince each other.

482
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:05,083
I offer you a choice--

483
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,583
live with us
as one of us...

484
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:12,709
Or...?
Or I will have you...

485
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:17,709
put to death.

486
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,250
Then that is what
you will have to do.

487
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:24,834
Worf, consider
this carefully.

488
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:28,458
That death
will be honorable.

489
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,792
The young people will see
what it is to die...

490
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,750
as a Klingon.

491
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:55,542
(<i> knocking at door</i> )

492
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,208
Enter.

493
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:00,917
Thank you.

494
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,000
I will remove
the tracking device.

495
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:07,291
Then you can go over the wall
and hide in the jungle.

496
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:10,041
Why are you doing this?

497
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,083
My father is wrong.

498
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:15,333
No matter how I might feel about
you, you don't deserve to die.

499
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:20,750
I am not going
to run away, Ba'el.

500
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:22,375
They will kill you.

501
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:25,500
Yes, but they
will not defeat me.

502
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:28,250
I don't understand you.

503
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,625
A Klingon does not run
away from his battles.

504
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:34,208
Is that really the lesson
you want us to learn?

505
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,083
You've taught us
a great deal,

506
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:38,750
awakened something inside us
that we never knew existed,

507
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:41,959
but I don't understand what
we can learn from your death.

508
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,792
Then you do not yet understand
what it is to be Klingon.

509
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:49,875
Worf...

510
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:52,959
in spite of everything
that's happened,

511
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I still sense that...

512
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:57,667
that you care for me.

513
00:35:57,709 --> 00:35:59,750
Am I wrong?

514
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:04,834
You talk so much
about being a warrior,

515
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,834
about honor and death.

516
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:11,041
Is it so hard
to speak of love?

517
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,041
Worf, please.

518
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:21,750
I would not have
thought it possible

519
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:24,000
to love a Romulan.

520
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:25,709
But you do.

521
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:30,125
Yes.

522
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,667
Well, if you've
come that far,

523
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:34,542
can't you take it
one more step?

524
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:38,291
Can't you stay here with us?
With me?

525
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:41,834
If there<i> were</i> a way,

526
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:44,083
I would take you
away with<i> me.</i>

527
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:50,583
If there is anything
that I've learned from you--

528
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,125
from your reaction
to me--

529
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:56,417
it's that I have
no place out there.

530
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:58,875
Other Klingons
will not accept me

531
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,417
for what I am.

532
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:02,208
And if I stay here,

533
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,250
<i>these</i> Klingons will not
accept me for what<i> I</i> am.

534
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,208
Why did you come here?

535
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,083
We were so happy.

536
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:11,917
We didn't know that there was
anything missing in our lives.

537
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:14,000
Ba'el...

538
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,500
Good-bye, Worf.

539
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,333
(<i> door closes</i> )

540
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:41,125
(<i> murmur of conversation</i> )

541
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:09,250
I know that there
are those among you

542
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:12,667
who may question
what I am about to do,

543
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:16,375
and you would not
be wrong to do so.

544
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:18,125
I have questioned myself.

545
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:20,792
I have spent the night
considering my decision--

546
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:24,917
challenging myself to
justify whether it<i> is</i> right

547
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:27,125
and I have reached
the conclusion

548
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:30,083
that it is
absolutely necessary...

549
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:32,834
to put this man to death.

550
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,834
What we have
built together

551
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:38,166
would be destroyed
by this man

552
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:41,291
and I cannot allow
that to happen.

553
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:49,166
I give you one last chance
to accept our way of life.

554
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:52,792
Those are eloquent words,
Tokath,

555
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:56,667
but the truth is,
I am being executed

556
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,458
because I brought
something dangerous

557
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,083
to your young people--
knowledge.

558
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:06,417
Knowledge of their origins,

559
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:09,500
knowledge of the real reasons
you are here in this camp.

560
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:11,542
The truth is
a threat to you.

561
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,458
Enough.

562
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:15,959
Stand ready.

563
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,417
Raise your weapons.

564
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:26,875
Father...
TOQ: Stop this!

565
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,875
If you kill him,

566
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:39,333
you will have to kill<i> me.</i>

567
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:48,083
Step aside, Toq.

568
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:51,291
Worf would rather die
than accept this way of life

569
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,792
and so would I.

570
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:57,458
I want to leave,
as do many others.

571
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,500
You will have to kill us
to keep us here.

572
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:06,041
You see, Tokath...

573
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,625
it is already
too late.

574
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,125
I'm warning you.

575
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:13,834
Move aside now.

576
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:17,125
Stand ready.

577
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,291
Toq... move away.

578
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,458
Take aim...

579
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:06,000
Ba'el.

580
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,709
Tokath.

581
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:15,625
Long ago,

582
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:19,166
when your captives
asked to stay here,

583
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:21,709
our hope was to avoid

584
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,125
dishonoring our children
on the homeworld,

585
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,125
but perhaps
over the years,

586
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:30,500
we lost sight of
our children

587
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,083
that we raised here.

588
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:34,542
This is<i> our</i> prison.

589
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:35,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

590
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:38,125
It should not
be theirs.

591
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:05,250
Years ago, your parents
made a great sacrifice

592
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,041
for the sake
of their families.

593
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:10,333
Today,
they do so again.

594
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,709
For that,
we must honor them.

595
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:16,667
You<i> must</i> promise them

596
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:19,542
never to reveal
their secret.

597
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:24,625
No one must know
of this place.

598
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:30,625
A supply ship is due
in a few days.

599
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,458
They will take us.

600
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,375
When they arrive,
Tokath will explain it to them.

601
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:39,208
Then we will start
a new life.

602
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,375
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental:</i>

603
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:49,333
<i>Our search for Lieutenant Worf</i>
<i>was cut short</i>

604
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:51,500
<i>when we received</i>
<i>a cryptic message from him</i>

605
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,834
<i>requesting a rendezvous</i>
<i>with a Romulan vessel.</i>

606
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:57,458
<i>He has informed us we will</i>
<i>be taking on passengers.</i>

607
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,500
It's good to see you.

608
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:10,333
He seems fine.

609
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:13,875
We're giving everyone
a thorough checkup in Sick Bay.

610
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,792
Thank you, Doctor.

611
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:23,625
Welcome home,
Mr. Worf.
Thank you, sir.

612
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,667
Picard to Bridge.

613
00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:29,083
Signal the Romulan ship that
the last group is on board.
BRIDGE: Aye, sir.

614
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:32,875
You found what you were
looking for, Mr. Worf?

615
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:37,750
No, sir.
There was no prison camp.

616
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:40,041
Those young people are
survivors of a vessel

617
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,709
that crashed in the Carraya
system four years ago.

618
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,625
No one survived Khitomer.

619
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,125
I understand.
