00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:03,542
WOMAN (<i> over P.A.</i> ):
Dr. Nesser,

2
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:05,792
please contact Station 12.
Dr. Nesser, contact...

3
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:07,333
MAN: Got a Code Blue here.
Call Dr. Berel.

4
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:08,875
Watch the door.
All right.

5
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:12,125
Careful, he may have
sustained cranial damage.

6
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,917
WOMAN: Move him to
the diagnostic pad.

7
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:15,166
Right.
Slowly.

8
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,583
I got it.
Here we go.

9
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,750
Slowly.
That's good.

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,834
Need him here stat.

11
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:21,083
(<i> monitor beeping</i> )

12
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,542
All right, all
right, careful.

13
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:23,792
Readings?

14
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:26,250
Uh, they're
fluctuating, sir.

15
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,500
He took a severe blow.

16
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,583
Possible trauma
to the telencephalon.

17
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,041
Start 15 octares
of quadroline.

18
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,667
We'll need a complete
del-scan series.

19
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,166
I can't find
his cardial organ.

20
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,375
What do you mean?
I'm reading

21
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,458
a steady circulation.

22
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,083
There it is.
Up here.

23
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,917
In his digestive tract?

24
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,417
You ever seen
anything like this?

25
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:51,500
He's missing
three costal struts on one side.

26
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:54,083
And four on the other.

27
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:57,250
You think<i> that's</i> something?
Look at this.

28
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,667
He has digits on his terminus.

29
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,500
What are you?

30
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:17,166
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

31
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,166
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

32
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:56,625
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

33
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,250
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

37
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:08,625
Yes, Doctor.
Right away.

38
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:15,500
(<i> monitors beeping</i> )

39
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,542
What happened?

40
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:27,750
You are in the
Crisis Room

41
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,959
at the Sikla
Medical Facility.

42
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,208
You've had a
severe injury,

43
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,333
but you're going
to be all right.

44
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,000
(<i> sighs</i> )

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,834
I was caught in the riots
when the police moved in.

46
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:39,458
That's the last thing
I remember.

47
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,291
Can you tell
us your name?

48
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:46,208
Rivas.
Rivas Jakara.

49
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,667
Rivas Jakara.

50
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,834
Where do you live?

51
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:54,417
In the Marta community,
on the Southern continent.

52
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,083
You're a long way from home.

53
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,333
Do you have any members
of your family we should notify?

54
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,333
No. I have no family.

55
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,250
I can't stay here.
I have to get...

56
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,667
You're in no condition
to leave... yet.

57
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:09,875
(<i> groaning</i> )

58
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,750
There are several
unusual things

59
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,333
about your case,
Mr. Jakara.

60
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,500
Your cranial lobes,
for instance.

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,291
They seem to be
surgical implants.

62
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,333
I had cosmetic surgery

63
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,917
to correct a genetic
birth defect.

64
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:25,750
And these?

65
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,709
Another birth defect?

66
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,667
Yes. Isn't
that something?

67
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:32,291
My father's were the same way.

68
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,750
You want us to believe that
all your abnormalities

69
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,458
are inherited
genetic traits?

70
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,709
I understand
your confusion.

71
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:42,291
My personal physician
is much more familiar

72
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:46,583
with these
genetic irregularities.

73
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,667
To be honest,

74
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,166
I would feel much better
back home under her care.

75
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,792
Why don't I talk
to her about that?

76
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,542
What's her name?

77
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:57,250
Crusher.
Actually...

78
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,875
I'm not sure
you'll be able to reach her.

79
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,375
Why not?

80
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,834
She's taking a sabbatical.

81
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:10,291
Well, we'll do the
best we can for you.

82
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,125
Oh, there was
one other thing.

83
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,750
We found this
curious-looking device

84
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,125
in your clothes.
What is it?

85
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,375
It's just a toy.

86
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,083
I was taking it
home, as a present.

87
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,417
I thought you didn't
have any family.

88
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:30,333
It's for a neighbor's child.

89
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,500
Was there anything else found?
I had one piece of jewelry--

90
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,208
a metal pin.

91
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,750
No. I'm sorry.
This was all we found.

92
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,542
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

93
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,625
(<i> groans</i> )

94
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,375
Genetic
irregularities?

95
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,875
That<i> thing</i> isn't even the
same species as we are.

96
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,291
Keep your voice down.

97
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,959
The last thing we need
is a panic in here

98
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,083
over some--

99
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,166
It's all
the space flights.

100
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,041
They have attracted
creatures from outer space.

101
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,583
That's exactly the kind of
thing I don't want to hear.

102
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,583
What are you going to do?

103
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

104
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:13,083
Of all the medical facilities
available...

105
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,750
why did he have to end up here?

106
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,291
I think we ought to call
Central Security.

107
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,458
Well, I'm not
calling anybody yet.

108
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,375
Not till we've done
a lot more.

109
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,542
A lot more.

110
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,625
I want his story
checked out.

111
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,875
Run a complete search
through the medical library.

112
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,041
Be absolutely certain there's
never been anything like him.

113
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,542
What if there's
more of them, hmm?

114
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:30,917
They could be everywhere.

115
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:32,208
Cordon off the wing.

116
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,291
I want security on his
door 29 hours a day

117
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,000
and I want this kept quiet.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,166
WOMAN (<i> over P.A.</i> ):
Code Three drill in B Wing.

119
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:41,125
All instructors
report immediately.

120
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:44,667
Code Three drill in B Wing.
All instructors report...

121
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,917
At 12.4 after launch

122
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:56,041
the warp field generator
will be activated.

123
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,375
That's when it would
break the light barrier?

124
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,917
Yes, Chancellor.

125
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,375
If we're successful,

126
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,041
the craft will leave
our star system,

127
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,417
and in a matter
of minutes

128
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:06,333
will be on its way
to the Garth system.

129
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,208
And then what?

130
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,417
And then, Krola,
we'll see what's there.

131
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,583
How long, Mirasta?

132
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,000
We have the prototype
design for the warp engine.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,458
It would simply be a
matter of building

134
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,625
the actual
production units.

135
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,959
If I get your approval
today, ten months.

136
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,500
Maybe less.

137
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,625
KROLA:
Chancellor?

138
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,709
I'll admit
Mirasta's enthusiasm

139
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:30,542
for her work
is seductive,

140
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,667
but perhaps we're
moving too fast.

141
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,875
Your opponents
will see this

142
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,750
as another example of your
determination to pull us

143
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,458
further from our
traditional ways.

144
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,000
My opponents look back,
as I look forward.

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,041
I cannot believe that my people
would choose to retreat

146
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,458
after all we've done.

147
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,709
I agree.

148
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,500
The people were willing
to accept your social reforms

149
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,083
because they believe
in you, Chancellor.

150
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,458
But there are many who say
we have gone far enough.

151
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:00,083
All these new ideas,
new technology,

152
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,875
and now, space travel?

153
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,000
It confuses them,
frightens them.

154
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:15,625
I will not allow them
to remain in the Dark Ages.

155
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,834
The warp program will proceed
as you have outlined, Mirasta.

156
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,750
And then we will
slow down, Krola,

157
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,417
to let everyone catch
their breath,

158
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:32,959
including you.

159
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,917
Mirasta Yale.

160
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,125
Yes?

161
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,667
Please, don't be alarmed
at our appearance.

162
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,125
My name
is Jean-Luc Picard.

163
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,959
This is my associate,
Deanna Troi.

164
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:19,500
What are you?

165
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,875
We've come with some very
important information.

166
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,250
About what?

167
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,625
PICARD:
About space.

168
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,667
About the universe you
are preparing to enter.

169
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,000
We come from a
federation of planets.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,250
Captain Picard is from
a planet called Earth,

171
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,959
which is over 2,000
light-years from here.

172
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:41,875
I'm from another planet
called Betazed.

173
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,208
(<i> sighs</i> )

174
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,041
We've been monitoring
your progress

175
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,208
toward warp drive capability.

176
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,041
When a society reaches
your level of technology

177
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,166
and is clearly
about to initiate warp travel,

178
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:57,417
we feel the time is right
for first contact.

179
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,500
We prefer meeting
like this

180
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,083
rather than a random
confrontation in deep space.

181
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,750
We've come to you first

182
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,417
because you're a leader
in the scientific community.

183
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:10,291
Scientists generally
accept our arrival

184
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,750
more easily than others.

185
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,291
We almost always encounter
shock and fear

186
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,709
on this sort of mission.

187
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:18,458
We hope that you will help us
to facilitate

188
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,750
our introduction.

189
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,709
Is this a joke?

190
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,500
Did Lupo and the others from
the lab put you up to this?

191
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,834
Oh, it's certainly no joke.

192
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,458
As you can see,
we are physically

193
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,166
quite different from Malcorians.

194
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:35,625
And, with your permission,
I'm prepared to prove it to you.

195
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,333
I would like that.

196
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,625
Picard to<i> Enterprise.</i>

197
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,417
Three to beam up.

198
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,959
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

199
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:43,250
It's everything
I ever dreamed of.

200
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,667
When I was a child

201
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:02,333
my parents would take
me to the planetarium.

202
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,250
And we would sit in the dark,

203
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,750
and it was as if
I was on a spaceship

204
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,166
on my way to another world

205
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,917
to meet people
on other planets.

206
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,959
Part of me keeps waiting
for the lights to come up

207
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,875
and the program to end.

208
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:22,083
How did you
know about me?

209
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

210
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:28,500
We learn as much as possible
about a planet

211
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,709
before we make
first contact.

212
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:34,500
One of the things we monitor
are your broadcast signals--

213
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,583
your journalism,
your music, your humor.

214
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,000
Try to understand you
better as a people.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,083
(<i> chuckles</i> )

216
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,291
I hate to think
how you would judge us

217
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,792
based on our popular music
and entertainment.

218
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:48,917
Indeed.

219
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:52,291
We do get an
incomplete picture,

220
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,375
which is why we also do...

221
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,959
surface reconnaissance.

222
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,166
You've had people on our planet?

223
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,166
For several years.

224
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,625
PICARD:
These are specialists.

225
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,041
Highly-trained
observation teams--

226
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,917
superficially identical
to yourselves--

227
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:14,208
and, therefore, able to blend
naturally into your society.

228
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,166
You see, we have discovered
that the most hazardous

229
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,125
aspect of these missions

230
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,333
is the lack
of sufficient information.

231
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,458
You don't have to explain.

232
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,250
I understand.

233
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,208
Although not everybody
on my planet would.

234
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,625
They would think you were trying
to infiltrate our society.

235
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,583
Well, there is
a difficulty here.

236
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,625
One that has forced us

237
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,917
to accelerate
this entire process.

238
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:43,500
One of our people is missing--

239
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,208
my First Officer,
Commander William Riker.

240
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,125
He was down on the
planet's surface

241
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,041
coordinating with
the observation team

242
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,750
the final details
of contact.

243
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,208
He disappeared.

244
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,583
My people have made inquiries,

245
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,166
but they have not been able
to locate him.

246
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,792
If there is anything
you can do to help...

247
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,500
Oh, of course.

248
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,542
Where was Riker's
last known location?

249
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,208
The capital city.

250
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,709
He was under the name
"Rivas Jakara"--

251
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,000
a tourist
from the Marta community.

252
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,542
Well, we must find him
before someone realizes

253
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,208
what he<i> really</i> is.

254
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,125
If this gets out
prematurely,

255
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,625
it could seriously
complicate matters.

256
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,750
Our ideology is based
on the assumption

257
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,917
that the Malcorian is
a supreme life-form,

258
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:31,875
and our world
is the center of the universe.

259
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,417
Your arrival will change

260
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:37,917
our entire understanding
of life.

261
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,792
And some will not
want it to change.

262
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,208
What about Durken?

263
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,125
(chuckles softly)
Durken...

264
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,875
he will be open-minded,
but cautious.

265
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,208
I strongly suggest
that you do not discuss

266
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,250
your surveillance teams with
him, at least not right away.

267
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,333
But with the disappearance
of Commander Riker,

268
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,542
wouldn't it be prudent--

269
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,000
Captain Picard,

270
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,125
I must ask you
to trust me on this.

271
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,792
If you tell the Chancellor
about Commander Riker,

272
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,208
you will undermine everything

273
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,625
that you hope
to accomplish here.

274
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,125
Durken will
assign Krola,

275
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,375
our Minister of Security,
to find him,

276
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,375
and Krola has
his own political agenda.

277
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,417
He will perceive you
as the greatest threat

278
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,291
that our people have ever known.

279
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,208
And he will not hesitate
to use Riker

280
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,667
to prove that he is correct.

281
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,500
(<i> quietly</i> )
...from another planet.

282
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,083
Hundreds of 'em.

283
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,458
I saw them.

284
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,917
It doesn't make sense
that he's the only one.

285
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:43,500
Think about it.
It's true.

286
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,041
I'm sure they
have a whole...

287
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,041
(<i> whispers continue</i> )

288
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,250
I thought I said this was
to be kept a secret.

289
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,375
You know Nilrem.

290
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,166
Well, it's getting
out of control.

291
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,667
I don't know
what else he is,

292
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:59,500
but he is still a patient
in this medical facility.

293
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,333
And we have a responsibility
for his care and recovery.

294
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,375
Remind them
of that, will you?

295
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,250
You're not going to be able
to contain this much longer.

296
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,291
I know.
If people get scared enough,

297
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,000
anything could happen.

298
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,834
Mr. Jakara,
we have been unable

299
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:30,917
to confirm anything
you told us.

300
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:34,250
No physician named
Crusher is on file--

301
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,667
not on<i> this</i> planet.

302
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

303
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,375
Your address in Marta is
an eating establishment.

304
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,500
The cook has never
heard of Rivas Jakara.

305
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,417
Well, obviously, there's been
some misunderstanding.

306
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,875
There's a growing
number of people

307
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,458
on the other side of
that door who believe

308
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,083
that you are not one
of us, Mr. Jakara.

309
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,208
Not one of you?

310
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,583
That you are from
another planet.

311
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,208
Are you,
Mr. Jakara?

312
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,208
Do you realize
what you're saying?

313
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,959
I know how
it sounds.

314
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,041
I'm not anxious
to make a fool of myself.

315
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,583
This new era of space flight...

316
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,959
it fires the imagination.

317
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,166
People see unidentified vessels
in the sky.

318
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,125
They turn out to be
weather balloons.

319
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,166
Well, it's far more likely
that<i> I</i> am a weather balloon

320
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,291
than an alien.

321
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,500
(<i> sighs</i> )

322
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,333
Our medical journals
have documented

323
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,000
several cases of genetic
mutation in recent history.

324
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,333
Some unusual physical
disfigurations

325
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,875
have occurred.

326
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,125
I'm just another case for
your medical journals, then.

327
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,750
Perhaps.

328
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,583
But you, Mr. Jakara,
are hiding something.

329
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,625
And unless you tell me
the truth about yourself,

330
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,375
this rumor will
persist and grow

331
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,542
and could even
become dangerous,

332
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:54,250
most especially to you.

333
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,000
(<i> door opens</i> )

334
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,291
(<i> door closes</i> )

335
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,959
(<i> ringing</i> )

336
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,792
MAN: Chancellor, Minister Yale
of the Space Bureau

337
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,375
would like to
introduce you to someone.

338
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,667
Call her back, see if the
Vice-Chancellor will do.

339
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:25,041
MAN: They're out here
waiting to see you, sir.

340
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:28,542
(<i> sighs</i> )
All right, send them in.

341
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,583
(<i> beeping</i> )

342
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,834
Always time to meet
your friends, Mirasta.

343
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,041
Chancellor, I think
you might want to clear

344
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,500
your afternoon
schedule for this.

345
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,750
And this...

346
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,709
is the Bridge.

347
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,250
Chancellor.

348
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,709
Here we have environment
and engineering stations,

349
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:14,208
mission operations,

350
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,333
and the two principal
science stations.

351
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,375
Data, allow me
to introduce

352
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,333
Chancellor
Avel Durken

353
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,500
and Space Administrator
Mirasta Yale.

354
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,375
Chancellor. Minister.

355
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,500
Commander Data
is my Second Officer.

356
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,875
He's an android,
Chancellor--

357
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,000
a constructed being.

358
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,417
A machine?

359
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:34,166
In a manner of speaking.

360
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,208
The term "artificial life-form"
would be more accurate.

361
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,333
Captain Picard,
is there some place

362
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,834
we might speak together
without distraction?

363
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:48,208
Certainly.

364
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,125
Chancellor,
with your permission,

365
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,875
I would like to "beam"
to the surface.

366
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,625
I have several
matters to attend to.

367
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,125
Not a word to anyone
about this, Mirasta.

368
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,375
Of course.

369
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,333
Mr. Data, will you escort
the Minister

370
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,792
to the Transporter Room?

371
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:05,125
Chancellor.

372
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,417
Has there still been
no communication

373
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,083
from Commander
Riker, Data?

374
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,750
No, Minister.
He has not returned

375
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,625
to our designated
transport coordinates.

376
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,834
We have continued to scan the
capital city without success.

377
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,834
PICARD: I've been saving
this for a special occasion.

378
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:28,625
My brother on Earth produces
a fruit known as "grapes"

379
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,041
which he turns into wine.

380
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,250
He's really quite
good at it.

381
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,959
Chancellor,
we have a tradition

382
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:38,834
called a "toast."

383
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:42,709
It is a drink
to salute one's friends

384
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,125
and good fortune.

385
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,583
And I would like
to propose a toast

386
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,667
to our new friendship.

387
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

388
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,333
We have something
very much like this

389
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,250
on Malcor III.

390
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,667
I think we shall find
we have much in common.

391
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,917
And much that is
not in common.

392
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,917
An opportunity to learn
from one another.

393
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:12,333
You speak the language of
diplomacy very well, Captain.

394
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,625
It's a language
I appreciate and understand,

395
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:19,000
but I have learned
to not always trust it.

396
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,959
Trust requires time
and experience.

397
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:27,375
My world's history has recorded
that conquerors often arrived

398
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,709
with the words,
"We are your friends."

399
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,917
We are not here
as conquerors, Chancellor.

400
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:36,583
What<i> do</i> you want?

401
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,542
A beginning.

402
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:41,333
But how we proceed
is entirely up to you.

403
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,083
And if my wishes should
conflict with yours?

404
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,667
There'll be no conflict.

405
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,125
And if I should tell you
to leave

406
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,792
and never return to my world?

407
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:52,417
We will leave
and never return.

408
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,583
Chancellor,
we are here only to help

409
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:03,458
guide you into a new era.

410
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,959
I can assure you,
we will not interfere

411
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:09,000
in the natural development
of your planet.

412
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,041
That is, in fact,
our Prime Directive.

413
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,625
I can infer
from that directive

414
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,375
that you do not intend
to share

415
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,041
all this exceptional
technology with us.

416
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,959
That is not the<i> whole</i> meaning,
but it is part of it.

417
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,583
Is this your way
of maintaining superiority?

418
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,375
Chancellor,
to instantly transform

419
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,667
a society with technology
would be harmful

420
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,917
and it would be destructive.

421
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,208
You're right, of course.

422
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm... overwhelmed,
Captain Picard.

423
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,792
I'm...

424
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:50,959
I'm quite overwhelmed.

425
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,750
I go home each night
to a loving wife,

426
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,333
two beautiful daughters.

427
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,750
We eat the evening meal
together as a family.

428
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,500
I think that's important.

429
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,125
And they always ask me
if I've had a good day.

430
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:11,125
And how will you answer them
tonight, Chancellor?

431
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,208
I will have to say,
"This morning,

432
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:18,333
"I was the leader of
the universe as I knew it.

433
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:23,083
"This afternoon, I am only
a voice in a chorus.

434
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:30,291
But I think it was a good day."

435
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,625
(<i> grunts</i> )

436
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:54,458
There are guards out there.
You'll never escape that way.

437
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,041
I'm not afraid of you.

438
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,917
Good.

439
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:05,542
Because there's nothing
to be afraid of.

440
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:08,041
We shouldn't fear
the unknown.

441
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,917
We should embrace it.

442
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,083
Can you help me
get out of here?

443
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,333
Are you really an alien?

444
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,250
It's all right
to tell me.

445
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,458
No.
I'm not an alien.

446
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,166
I don't believe you.
You<i> are</i> an alien.

447
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,417
I really have to leave.

448
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:29,583
I could divert the
guard's attention.

449
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:32,000
You might stand a chance
if you took the service exit

450
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,542
down the hallway to the right.

451
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,125
To the right?

452
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,500
Fine. Let's do it.

453
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,000
Why should I?

454
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,750
Well...

455
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,542
you know why.

456
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:46,250
I don't belong here.

457
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,959
I have to get back on my ship...

458
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,250
in space.

459
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,208
I believe you.

460
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,542
Now, will you help me?

461
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,583
If you make love to me.

462
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:01,250
What?

463
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,625
I've always wanted to
make love with an alien.

464
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,333
Listen, Miss...?

465
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,792
Lanel.

466
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:11,250
Lanel...
I really have to get going.

467
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,125
All the other... aliens
are waiting for me.

468
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,542
Oh, it's not
so much to ask.

469
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:17,375
And then
I'll help you escape.

470
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,834
(<i> scoffs</i> )
It's not that easy.

471
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,375
There are differences

472
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,750
in the way that
my people make love.

473
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,792
I can't wait to learn.

474
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,375
But it's...

475
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,750
It's your only way
out of here...

476
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:35,542
my alien.

477
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,750
Something's happened to him.
I think he's dead.

478
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,959
Go on, get some help.

479
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,959
(<i> whispers</i> )
Okay.

480
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,750
No!
That way.

481
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,417
Thanks.
Hmm.

482
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:15,625
Will I ever see
you again?

483
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,333
I'll call you
the next time

484
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,750
I pass through
your star system.

Oh! They've aggravated the
injury to his renal organ.

Get him into a

and call Central
Security.

502
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:16,917
This has gone
too far.

(<i> murmuring voices</i> )

504
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,458
Their leader, Picard,
has made it clear

505
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:36,709
that how we proceed is
entirely our own decision.

506
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:38,166
You cannot possibly

507
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,875
be suggesting
surrender, Chancellor?

508
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,792
They are<i> not</i> hostile.

509
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:45,417
Mirasta, you are
incredibly naive.

510
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:47,834
Can you be so enraptured with
the notion of space travelers

511
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,959
that you are blind to the
threat they represent?

512
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,834
I have seen their
vessel, Krola.

513
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:53,250
If they chose to be hostile,

514
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,542
I do not think
we would be standing here now.

515
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:57,375
Why should they use force

516
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,667
when we are ready
to lay down in fear?

517
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:02,375
I do<i> not</i> lay down in fear.

518
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,500
To them or to you, Krola.

519
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,125
Chancellor,
I mean no disrespect,

520
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,750
but I have repeatedly
warned you

521
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,208
about your policies,
taking us too quickly

522
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,917
where we had no business
going in the first place.

523
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:15,417
New philosophies,
new economics,

new technologies.

525
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,875
And there are still
many people who value

526
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:20,834
our traditional way of life,
and I, for one,

527
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,834
am willing
to die to defend it.

528
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,417
Open your eyes, Krola.

529
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:26,917
We are part
of a greater community.

530
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:28,250
We cannot ignore it.

531
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,333
<i>You</i> would ignore<i> them...</i>

532

and spy on us.

What are you saying, Krola?

534
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,500
We have captured
one of their spies.

535

Chancellor,

536
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,375
he is Captain Picard's
First Officer--

537
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:51,208
Commander Riker.

538
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:58,458
You knew about this, Mirasta?

539
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:01,000
He has been missing
for two days.

540
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,500
I told Captain Picard
not to discuss this,

541
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,333
because I was afraid this
is exactly what would happen.

542
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:10,041
What else do you know, Mirasta?
Everything!

543
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,917
They have been on our planet,

544
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:18,041
observing,
for several years.

545
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:19,500
Years?

546
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,083
Imagine what they have done--

547
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:25,000
influenced our young,
stirred up dissent.

548
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,542
They were
collecting information.

549
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:34,417
Where is this
Commander Riker now?

550
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:37,208
He's in the Sikla
Medical Facility.

551
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,625
He's recovering
from surgery.

552
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:42,792
He suffered head injuries
in an escape attempt.

553
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:45,792
He will recover consciousness
in a few hours.

554
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:57,792
(<i> quiet voices</i> )

555
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:06,208
Will he survive?

556
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:08,792
I didn't think he would
have survived the injuries.

557
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:12,917
I have to interrogate
him before he dies.

558
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:15,583
Well, at least give him time
to regain some strength.

559
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:17,291
Come back tomorrow.

560
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:20,291
It cannot wait
until tomorrow.

561
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,625
(<i> door opens</i> )

562
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,834
Krola, we can get
help from his ship.

563
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,458
With their medical technology,
he might recover.

564
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,542
We're not giving
him back.

565
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:44,709
He's the one
advantage we have now.

566
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,542
Use your drugs
to revive him.

567
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:49,291
Those drugs
increase cardial rate

568
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:51,000
and vascular pressure.
That's the last thing

569
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,583
we need to do
to him right now.

570
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:57,792
(<i> whispers</i> )
It will probably be enough

571
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,000
to kill him.

572
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,875
You can't do it.

573
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,208
Revive him.

574
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,041
I'm just a physician,
Minister.

575
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,208
I don't know much
about affairs of state.

576
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:11,792
But he is a living,
intelligent being.

577
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:15,583
I don't care if the Chancellor,
himself, calls down here.

578
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,709
I have sworn an oath to
do no harm, and I will not.

579
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:23,083
Then I'll find someone
to replace you.

580
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:36,583
(<i> birds chirping</i> )

581
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,083
Chancellor.

582
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,667
You're punctual,
Captain.

583
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,125
I know how
busy you are.

584
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:49,500
Do you?

585
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,834
I think you know
a great deal more

586
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:52,250
about me than I know
about you.

587
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,959
In what respect?

588
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:56,333
You speak
of trust and peace,

589
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,542
and working together
to enter a new era.

590
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,625
And at the same time,
you conduct

591
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:03,333
secret surveillance
posing as Malcorians.

592
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,333
Commander Riker.

593
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,333
Commander Riker.

594
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,875
Mirasta said it would be
a mistake to discuss--

595
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,333
Yes.

596
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,875
She has already tried to
accept the responsibility.

597
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,500
It was my error, not hers.

598
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,625
Chancellor,
there is no starship mission

599
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,250
more dangerous than that
of first contact.

600
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,000
We never know what we will face

601
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,375
when we open the door
on a new world--

602
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,959
how we will be greeted,

603
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:40,458
what exactly the dangers
will be.

604
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,083
Centuries ago,
disastrous contact

605
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,625
with the Klingon Empire
led to decades of war.

606
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:47,458
And it was decided then

607
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:50,542
we would do surveillance
<i>before</i> making contact.

608
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:55,000
It... it was
a controversial decision.

609
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,458
I believe it prevented more
problems than it created.

610
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:05,000
I can appreciate the logic
of your position, Captain.

611
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,875
But it would seem
that full disclosure

612
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:09,333
<i>after</i> contact would have
been in order.

613
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,208
In time, there would have been
full disclosure.

614
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:14,250
I can only ask you
to believe that.

615
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,166
On other worlds,
it would not be an issue.

616
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:20,291
But here, everything
our observers reported

617
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:23,417
indicated that the people
of<i> this</i> world

618
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:27,083
would almost certainly
react negatively to our arrival.

619
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:30,083
We could see that
even surveillance

620
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:32,834
might be interpreted as
an act of aggression.

621
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:36,166
I hoped that we would have
found Commander Riker

622
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:39,583
before you did,
so that this matter

623
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,500
would not complicate
our introduction.

624
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:45,667
It was a mistake.

625
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:50,500
Yes.

626
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,333
A mistake I might have made
in your place.

627
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,041
I rather like it, actually.

628
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,291
Like it?

629
00:33:57,291 --> 00:34:00,375
That you make mistakes,
like any man.

630
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:04,542
Chancellor, I have made
some fine ones in my time.

631
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,000
Now, I must
ask you.

632
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,959
Will you release my officer?

633
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:12,750
We'll talk again later,
Captain.

634
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:17,000
<i>Enterprise,</i>
one to beam up.

635
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,792
Yes, I understand.

636
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,333
I have been relieved
of my duties,

637
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:34,041
as I'm sure you
already know.

638
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:36,959
You are Acting Director of
the facility, Nilrem.

639
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,667
Revive him.

640
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,166
Leave us.

641
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:32,291
I am Minister Krola
of Internal Security.

642
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:33,875
You are Riker...

643
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,750
an alien.

644
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,500
Yes, we know.

645
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:44,083
Please bring
my people here.

646
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,875
In time... in time.

647
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:52,166
But first, I need
to ask you some questions.

648
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:59,709
Thank you for
seeing me.

649
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,375
If I did not
depend so much

650
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:03,834
on your expertise
in space matters,

651
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:06,125
I would have asked
for your resignation.

652
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:08,125
I felt I was acting
in the best interests

653
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,542
of our people, Chancellor.

654
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,625
When you are selected
to occupy this office,

655
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,500
then you will have the
privilege of deciding

656
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,417
the best
interests of our people.

657
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:22,417
Picard, I can excuse,
but<i> you,</i> Mirasta.

658
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:25,125
You should have
trusted me.

659
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,792
Chancellor, we must
release Riker to Picard.

660
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:30,583
Any hope for a relationship with
these people depends on it.

661
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:34,000
I can't afford to be
the idealist you are, Mirasta.

662
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,542
But Riker--
I am prepared

663
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:39,917
to release Riker<i> after</i>
we have interrogated him.

664
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:42,458
Are you prepared
for him to die, Chancellor?

665
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:45,583
His injuries are
extremely serious.

666
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:49,208
A mob at the medical facility
almost killed him.

667
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,083
Krola has ordered drugs
to be used

668
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,625
to revive him for questioning--
drugs that in his condition,

669
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,291
would be dangerous for him.

670
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:57,083
Without medical aid
from his ship,

671
00:36:57,083 --> 00:37:00,417
I believe that Riker
will not survive the day.

672
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:03,458
You must tell
Picard where he is.

673
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,500
You have lied since the
moment of your capture,

674
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,709
and I believe
you are lying now, Commander.

675
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:13,166
No, we're here on a
mission of peace.

676
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:16,250
Such noble
creatures.

677
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:21,792
Why do peaceful people
develop such lethal weapons?

678
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:27,458
Or do you still insist
it's just a toy?

679
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,125
(<i> loud clattering</i> )

680
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,959
An interesting toy,
to be sure.

681
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,000
It is only used for defense.

682
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,625
Perhaps, like
many conquerors,

683
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:40,458
you believe your goals
to be benevolent.

684
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,500
I cannot.

685
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,500
For however you would describe
your intentions,

686
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,542
you still represent
the end to my way of life.

687
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:51,166
I cannot permit
that to occur.

688
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:57,625
Eventually, Durken would choose
to welcome your people

689
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:00,834
with arms open
and eyes closed.

690
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:06,000
I must force him
down another path.

691
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,417
When they find us,
I will be dead--

692
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,250
killed by your weapon.

693
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,375
The lines
will be drawn.

694
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,583
A peaceful accord
will no longer be an option.

695
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,792
(<i> whispers</i> )
No...

696
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:26,709
For my people.

697
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:39,000
What happened?

698
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:42,500
He shot him.

699
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,583
The alien shot Krola.

700
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:52,000
Get me three octares
of adrulmine.

701
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,250
High-frequency
EM charge unit now.

702
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,000
I have a circulation pattern.

703
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,959
It's very weak.

704
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,667
We have to get him
on vital buffers

705
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,250
right now.

706
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:08,333
I'm a physician.
Don't be frightened.

707
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,959
I need to know
what happened.

708
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:11,083
Are you doctors?

709
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,417
Yes. He shot him.

710
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,834
With that thing.

711
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,166
Crusher to Picard.

712
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,500
PICARD:
Go ahead, Doctor.

713
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,208
Commander Riker
is near death,

714
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,917
but there's still
some brain activity.

715
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,792
I need to get him
back to the ship.

716
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,834
Acknowledged.
And there's a Malcorian male

717
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:28,875
with a phaser wound
in his upper chest.

718
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:31,166
I need to get him back, as well.

719
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,041
We'll meet you
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

720
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,166
Picard out.

721
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:00,875
They're both
going to be okay.

722
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,500
We were able to
stabilize Will.

723
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,959
If we had been any later...

724
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:06,125
Krola?

725
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,291
He was never in
any real danger.

726
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,959
The phaser was on stun.

727
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,417
"Stun"?

728
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:13,041
It's a defensive weapon.

729
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,750
Have you been able to
ascertain what happened?

730
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,875
Based on the angle of impact,
it suggests

731
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,834
that Krola's left hand was on
the phaser when it went off.

732
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,625
They were struggling
for the weapon.

733
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:24,667
Commander Riker
was in no position

734
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,875
to offer any kind of struggle,
Chancellor.

735
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:30,458
Krola was trying
to be a martyr?

736
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:48,917
Where is this?

737
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:52,875
You're aboard the starship,
my foolish old friend.

738
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:55,417
No, Chancellor.

739
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:57,583
You must not...

740
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,375
You must not pursue
relations with them.

741
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,542
Must not!

742
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:04,000
I know.

743
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,792
I know.

744
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,458
But, Chancellor--
Mirasta...

745
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:17,166
it goes against every
instinct of my being.

746
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:21,959
But my people are not ready
to accept what you represent.

747
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:25,583
Everything that happened in
the hospital proves that.

748
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,709
And Krola
is the best evidence of all.

749
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:31,458
We must slow down

750
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:35,458
and allow those who are like him
to join us in the present

751
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,875
before we can move
into the future.

752
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:38,500
But when we encounter
other beings in space,

753
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,667
our people must be ready.

754
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,083
The warp program
will have to be delayed.

755
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,583
We will divert more resources

756
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,583
to education
and social development,

757
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,959
to prepare for the day
when we<i> are</i> ready.

758
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:50,959
Chancellor,
I strongly disagree.

759
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:53,458
(<i> sighing</i> )
I know.

760
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,875
Captain...

761
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,208
you once said if I asked
you to leave,

762
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:03,000
you would do so
without hesitation.

763
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,667
I'm afraid I must ask you
to do just that.

764
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,709
Well...

765
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:13,875
it's your decision,
Chancellor.

766
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:16,625
But I must say...

767
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,750
I regret that I won't have
the opportunity

768
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,709
of knowing your people better.

769
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:23,250
We're a good people,
Captain--

770
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,458
a society
with much potential.

771
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:28,291
Once we cross
the threshold of space

772
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:30,041
we shall have to give up
this self-importance--

773
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:33,250
this conceit-- that we are
the center of the universe.

774
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,458
But this is not
the time for that.

775
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:39,792
For now, we will have to enjoy
that sweet innocence.

776
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:42,208
How will you
keep us secret,

777
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:47,750
when so many have seen
and heard so much?

778
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,375
The stories will be
told for many years,

779
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:50,583
I have no doubt...

780
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:52,709
about the ship that
made contact,

781
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:54,375
of the alien
who was held prisoner

782
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,709
in the medical facility.

783
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:59,083
There will be charges
of a government conspiracy.

784
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,333
Some of the witnesses
will tell their tales

785
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,458
and most of the people
will laugh at them,

786
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:07,125
and go back and watch
the more interesting fiction

787
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:09,834
of the daily broadcasts.

788
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:13,709
It will pass.

789
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:16,083
MIRASTA: I'm sorry to say
he's probably right.

790
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:21,291
Captain Picard,
I have one last request.

791
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,834
Take me with you.

792
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,875
She will be unhappy
with the restrictions

793
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:32,000
I must place upon her
at home, Captain.

794
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:39,291
We may not be back here
in your lifetime.

795
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:41,959
And... I have to believe

796
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:44,000
that you cannot be
fully prepared

797
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,917
for the realities
of space travel.

798
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:48,834
I have been prepared for
the realities of space travel

799
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:52,834
since I was nine years old and
sitting in a planetarium.

800
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:56,125
Mr. Worf, to my ready room.

801
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,667
Escort
Chancellor Durken

802
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,750
to the transporter
room, Lieutenant,

803
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,667
and... assign quarters
to Minister Yale.

804
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:10,959
She will be
remaining on board.

805
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:12,125
Aye, sir.

806
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:16,041
Until we return, then.

807
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:21,000
With luck,
we will both be around

808
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,166
to renew our friendship,
Captain.
