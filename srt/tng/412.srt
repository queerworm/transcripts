1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:05,166
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44429.6.</i>

2
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:08,542
<i>We are on a mapping survey</i>
<i>near the Cardassian sector.</i>

3
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:11,583
<i>It has been nearly a year</i>
<i>since a peace treaty ended</i>

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,500
<i>the long conflict between</i>
<i>the Federation and Cardassia.</i>

5
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:16,583
Captain, we
are nearing

6
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:20,959
the periphery
of Sector 21503.

7
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,291
Be on the lookout

8
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,667
for a Cardassian patrol ship,
Mr. Worf.

9
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:25,125
They should be hailing
us soon.

10
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,041
Even with the treaty,
they're still skittish

11
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,500
about protecting
their border.

12
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:31,875
Last time
I was in this sector

13
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:33,500
I was on the<i> Stargazer</i>

14
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:36,417
running at warp speed
ahead of a Cardassian warship.

15
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,083
TROI:
Running,
Captain?

16
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,041
You? That's hard to believe.

17
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,500
Believe it.

18
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,959
I'd been sent to make
preliminary overtures

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,625
to a truce, and I'd
lowered my shields

20
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,542
as a gesture of goodwill.

21
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,000
The Cardassians
were not impressed.

22
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,291
They had taken out
most of my weapons

23
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,750
and damaged the impulse engines
before I could regroup and run.

24
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:59,125
The Cardassians have no honor.

25
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,583
I do not trust them.

26
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,667
They're our allies now,
Mr. Worf.

27
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,166
We have to trust them.

28
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:08,667
Trust is earned, not given away.

29
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,542
I hope their scout ship
makes contact soon.

30
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,750
It's not a good idea to stay
too long on a Cardassian border

31
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:19,542
without making
your intentions known.

32
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:28,875
What... what is it?

33
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:33,125
Kelp buds, plankton loaf
and sea berries.

34
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,917
Oh.

35
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,291
Sweetheart

36
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,542
I'm not a fish.

37
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,083
It's very healthy.

38
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,250
I had this every morning
when I was growing up.

39
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,625
What? No muffins or oatmeal

40
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,125
or corned beef
and eggs?

41
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,375
For<i> breakfast?</i>

42
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:54,917
Keiko

43
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,625
I've been thinking.

44
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:59,542
You've been introducing me
to all this wonderful food

45
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,208
that you're
accustomed to.

46
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,667
I'd like to do the same.

47
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,709
Isn't that
what marriage is about?

48
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,959
Sharing?

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,834
What kind of foods?

50
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,875
Scalloped potatoes,
mutton shanks

51
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:12,625
oxtails
and cabbage.

52
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,125
Kind of heavy.

53
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,417
Oh, you'll love it.
I promise.

54
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,458
Oh, I can still remember
the aromas

55
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,959
when my mother was cooking.

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,875
She cooked?

57
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:25,041
Oh, she didn't believe
in a replicator.

58
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,875
She thought real food
was more nutritious.

59
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,458
She handled real meat?

60
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,875
She touched it and cut it?

61
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:33,959
Yeah, like a master chef.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,875
She was
fantastic.

63
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:38,250
Of course,<i> I'll</i> have to use
the replicator.

64
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,750
I'll make something special
for you tonight.

65
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:43,041
You'll love it.
I promise.

66
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,834
Okay.

67
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,917
Maybe<i> I'll</i> have something
special for you tonight too.

68
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,667
Mmm...

69
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:50,667
(<i> both chuckling</i> )

70
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,750
(<i> explosion</i> )

71
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:53,709
Something's wrong.

72
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,291
COMPUTER:
Red Alert.

73
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,709
Take emergency stations.

74
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,792
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

75
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:01,458
Cardassian ship
preparing to
fire again, sir.

76
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,542
Increase power
to the forward shields.

77
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,875
(<i> explosion</i> )

78
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,667
Hail them again,
Mr. Worf.

79
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,542
What the hell
is he doing?
Damage report.

80
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,417
Minor damage to
secondary hull

81
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,000
before we put up
our shields, sir.

82
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,959
No casualties.
Structural
integrity intact.

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,458
LA FORGE:
Engineering to Bridge.

84
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,458
Starboard power coupling
is down.

85
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,917
(<i> explosion</i> )

86
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,125
Evasive action--
Delta sequence.

87
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,458
Ready phasers, Mr. Worf.

88
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,750
Delta evasion plan initiated.

89
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,542
Limit targets
to engines and shields.

90
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,041
WORF:
Aye, sir.

91
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,583
Ready.

92
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,417
Fire.

93
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,000
Direct hit, sir.

94
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,166
Moderate damage
to their aft shield generators.

95
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,208
Continue phaser fire.

96
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,458
DATA:
Multiple
hits, sir.

97
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,291
Power failure
in their forward shields.

98
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,291
WORF:
The Cardassian ship

99
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,083
is standing down, sir.

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,166
Well, let's see
if they'll answer

101
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,375
our hail now, Mr. Worf.

102
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,166
Frequency open.

103
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,792
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard

104
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,959
of the Federation
Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

105
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:12,583
I am Gul Macet,
of the Cardassian ship<i> Trager.</i>

106
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,542
Why have you fired on us?

107
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,834
A curious question, Captain.

108
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,750
In war,
one attacks one's enemies.

109
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:23,500
There is a treaty
between our peoples.

110
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:27,625
Perhaps that fact was unknown
to the Federation starship

111
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:31,417
which destroyed our space
station in the Cuellar system

112
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,750
two days ago.

113
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,750
Federation starship?

114
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:39,083
Attacked an unarmed
science station.

115
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,709
They had barely enough time
to send an emergency signal

116
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,583
before they were incinerated.

117
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:50,125
Gul Macet, the Federation
and the Cardassians

118
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,917
have struggled too hard
for peace

119
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,166
to abandon it so easily.

120
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:59,834
We are not the ones
who have abandoned it, Captain.

121
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:04,125
Let me talk to my superiors,
find out what is behind this.

122
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,583
Give me one hour.

123
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,458
The alternative is for us

124
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,083
to continue firing
at one another.

125
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,458
And in such a contest,
you would be

126
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,792
at a disadvantage.

127
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,875
Very well.

128
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,875
<i>One</i> hour.

129
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:58,709
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

130
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,750
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

131
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,834
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

132
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,500
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

133
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:13,208
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

134
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,583
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

135
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,792
Captain, we've confirmed
your report.

136
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,917
It was the Starship<i> Phoenix</i>

137
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,375
under the command
of Benjamin Maxwell.

138
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,417
Ben Maxwell...

139
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,417
but he's one of Starfleet's
finest Captains.

140
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,375
He... he must have
had provocation.

141
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,542
I wish we knew.

142
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,333
He's gone on silent running.

143
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,375
Doesn't answer

144
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:37,542
our communiquÃ©s.

145
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,500
Then he's still
in Cardassian space?

146
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,583
The station he destroyed
was in Sector 21505.

147
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,667
You're the nearest starship.

148
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:48,792
We want you to go in
and find him.

149
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,375
Will the Cardassians
cooperate?

150
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,542
They've granted you
safe passage.

151
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,834
We've agreed that you'll take
along a delegation

152
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,000
of observers,
as a show of good faith.

153
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:04,417
Jean-Luc, I don't have
to tell you

154
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:10,291
the Federation is not prepared
for a new sustained conflict.

155
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,709
You must preserve the peace

156
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,625
no matter what the cost.

157
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,583
Haden out.

158
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,750
There will be three Cardassians
transporting aboard.

159
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,000
Their Captain, Gul Macet,
and two of his aides.

160
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,625
My intention is to be
as open as possible with them.

161
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,208
Allow them to share
in our search for the<i> Phoenix.</i>

162
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,834
Captain, it is necessary

163
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,166
to assign them
a security detail.

164
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,542
They're our guests, Mr. Worf.

165
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,917
I don't want them to feel
like prisoners.

166
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:45,625
RIKER:
I tend to agree with
Mr. Worf, Captain.

167
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,208
I think we should limit their
access while they're on board.

168
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,583
I don't think they need
to have the run of the ship.

169
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,125
At least allow me
to post guards

170
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,333
in some of the sensitive areas
of the ship.

171
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,709
Very well.
Let's limit their access

172
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,458
but you instruct your people
they are our guests.

173
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,000
Aye, sir.

174
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,375
Counselor,
I want you to stay

175
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,667
as close to the crew
as possible.

176
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,208
Some of them may feel
uncomfortable

177
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,792
with Cardassians on board.

178
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,500
I don't want any incidents.

179
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,709
Yes, Captain.

180
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,542
Mr. Data, is there
anyone else on board

181
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,834
who served previously
with Captain Benjamin Maxwell?

182
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,250
Accessing.

183
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,667
Chief O'Brien served
under his command

184
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,500
aboard the
<i>Rutledge,</i> sir.

185
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,583
PICARD:
Indeed.

186
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,583
Number One, will you
and the Counselor

187
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,458
meet our guests
in Transporter Room Three?

188
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,709
And inform Chief O'Brien
I will be calling on him.

189
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,875
Yes, sir.

190
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,750
RIKER:
Welcome
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

191
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,583
I'm First Officer
William Riker.

192
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,166
Counselor Deanna Troi.

193
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,583
I am Gul Macet.

194
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,417
My aides, Glinn Daro

195
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,000
Glinn Telle.

196
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,792
RIKER:
This is
our Transporter Chief

197
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:59,125
Mr. O'Brien.

198
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,583
Shall we?

199
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,542
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

200
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,542
<i>We have entered</i>
<i>Cardassian territory</i>

201
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,959
<i>and are proceeding on our quest</i>
<i>to locate the</i> Phoenix.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,417
And with long-range sensors

203
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,625
we've been scanning a radius
of ten light-years.

204
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:33,500
We can effectively scan
one sector a day.

205
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:35,041
We're scanning
Sector 21505 now.

206
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,208
And there's
still no sign

207
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,000
of the<i> Phoenix.</i>

208
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,542
In fact,
you have no assurance

209
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,500
that the ship is still
in Sector 21505.

210
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,750
In fact, we have no idea
where it is.

211
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,667
We thought
the last known coordinates

212
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:49,291
were a reasonably
good place

213
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,959
to start.

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,542
Captain Picard

215
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,500
you can understand
that we are skeptical.

216
00:10:57,542 --> 00:11:00,375
Do you expect us
to believe that
you are using

217
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:04,166
every means at your disposal
to track down one of your own?

218
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,041
Of course you are concerned,
Gul Macet.

219
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,750
It is precisely
because of that fact

220
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:12,125
that I have included you

221
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,709
in every aspect
of our effort.

222
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,208
You're present
with my staff.

223
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,709
You're hearing
reports as
I hear them.

224
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,041
Nothing edited,
nothing withheld.

225
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,750
Very well.

226
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,917
PICARD:
Transporter Chief
O'Brien served

227
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,834
with Benjamin Maxwell.

228
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:30,500
I thought that he might be able
to provide some insights.

229
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:33,208
Mr. O'Brien,
I understand

230
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,583
that Captain Maxwell lost
his family

231
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,458
during a raid on an outpost.

232
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,333
More like sabotage, sir.

233
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,500
It was on Setlik III.

234
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:46,083
A squad of Cardassian militia
made a sneak raid on an outpost.

235
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,583
Wiped out close
to 100 civilians.

236
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,291
Then it's revenge he's after.

237
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,542
That's not what I meant.

238
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,125
Maxwell is taking retribution
for his own loss.

239
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,041
Captain Maxwell would never...

240
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,542
Gentlemen, please, let's not
indulge in speculation.

241
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,458
Can we confine

242
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,041
our discussion
to the facts?

243
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,583
Now, Mr. O'Brien...

244
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,333
Worf to Captain Picard.

245
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,750
Go ahead, Mr. Worf.

246
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:13,000
Long-range sensors have located
the<i> Phoenix.</i>

247
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,333
Gul Macet,
will you join me

248
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,333
on the Bridge?

249
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,500
Deck six.

250
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,083
(<i> beeping</i> )

251
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,208
Deck ten.

252
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,667
(<i> beeping</i> )

253
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,959
Your Captain is most impressive.

254
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,166
Yes, he is.

255
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,625
Chief O'Brien

256
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,625
our transporting system
is still operating

257
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,875
with active feed
pattern buffers.

258
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:03,291
I would like to talk with you
about your technology.

259
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,458
I'll have to get

260
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,041
Commander La Forge's
approval on that.

261
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,583
I understand.

262
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,375
In the meantime

263
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:14,458
we're going
to your Ten-Forward.

264
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,125
Will you join us?

265
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,959
If my Commander tells me

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,041
to discuss the transporter
with you, I will.

267
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,583
If Captain Picard orders me
to tell you everything I know

268
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:30,667
about Ben Maxwell,
I will.

269
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,208
But who I choose to
spend my free time with

270
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,375
that's<i> my</i> business.

271
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:52,500
Captain, the<i> Phoenix</i>
is in Sector 21505.

272
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:54,417
Ensign, set a
course, warp six.

273
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,625
Mr. Worf,
send a message by subspace.

274
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,750
Tell them to prepare
for a rendezvous.

275
00:13:58,792 --> 00:13:59,709
Yes, Captain.

276
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,750
Captain, a
suggestion?

277
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,125
Yes.

278
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:07,458
We have a number of
ships in Sector 21505.

279
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
If you will give us
more precise coordinates

280
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:13,917
and the ship's coded
transponder frequency

281
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,458
we would be able
to intercept Maxwell

282
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,542
far more quickly
than you.

283
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,041
I'm sure that's true.

284
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,500
However, given
the circumstances

285
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:25,834
I would prefer to make
the initial contact myself.

286
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,458
I'm sure<i> you</i> would

287
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,917
if the situation
were reversed.

288
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,750
Captain, time
is crucial.

289
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,083
You have a dangerous
man out there

290
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,125
with a huge arsenal
at his command.

291
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,917
If he is intent upon
revenge against my people

292
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,458
he must be stopped
before he can
do more damage.

293
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,041
Captain, so far, we have
an isolated incident.

294
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,458
If I can reach him first

295
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,625
then perhaps
diplomacy can prevail

296
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:53,000
but if one of your ships
should decide to retaliate

297
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,959
there is a danger
we could lose control
of the situation.

298
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,041
Then you will not give
us the means to find
his precise location?

299
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,166
No, I won't.

300
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,291
O'BRIEN:
There you are.

301
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:14,750
Potato casserole,
a dish fit for kings.

302
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:20,083
âª The minstrel boy
to the war is gone... âª

303
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,875
(<i> humming</i> )

304
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:24,792
What's that
you're singing?

305
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:25,834
What?

306
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:29,125
Oh, it's just an old song.

307
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,417
A bunch of us used to sing it
together on the<i> Rutledge.</i>

308
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,834
I hadn't thought
about it in years.

309
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,500
What's it about?

310
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:41,041
Oh, it's about
war and glory.

311
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:46,583
âª The minstrel boy
to the war is gone âª

312
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:51,417
âª In the ranks of death
you will find him âª

313
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,750
âª His father's sword
he hath girded on âª

314
00:15:55,792 --> 00:16:01,542
âª And his wild harp
slung behind him. âª

315
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,500
Captain Maxwell
always liked that song.

316
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:07,458
I guess it's all this business
about him and the Cardassians

317
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,834
brought it back
to me.

318
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,959
You know, sitting
with the staff this morning

319
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,542
I could tell
there were people in that room

320
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,583
who still don't like

321
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,875
the Cardassians.

322
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:21,625
I imagine
that's to be expected.

323
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,166
You do?

324
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,750
Sure, the war lasted
a long time.

325
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,166
That takes its toll on people.

326
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,208
What are these little,
dark things?

327
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,417
Capers.

328
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,500
But the fighting's over now.

329
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:35,333
Why should anyone still feel...

330
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,125
however they feel?

331
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,834
You fought the Cardassians,
didn't you?

332
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,000
Well, there were some skirmishes
when I was with Captain Maxwell.

333
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,750
Well, how do<i> you</i> feel
about them?

334
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,834
Me?

335
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,542
Well, I feel fine.

336
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,291
I mean, the war's over now.

337
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,208
PICARD:
The pursuing ship
is the<i> Phoenix.</i>

338
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,250
And the other?

339
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,291
It appears to be
a Cardassian
supply ship.

340
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,917
How would
you know that?

341
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,542
We are able to make
that determination.

342
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,625
You can read
our transponder codes.

343
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,291
The important thing
at the moment

344
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,166
is that one of your ships
may be in jeopardy.

345
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,083
Mr. Worf, has there
been any answer to
our communication?

346
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:24,208
No, Captain.
Put out a repeating message
on all subspace channels.

347
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,667
Priority one communiquÃ©.

348
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:26,750
Break off your pursuit
immediately.

349
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:28,083
WORF:
Aye, sir.

350
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,125
Gul Macet, you see
we are doing everything

351
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,208
in our power
to reach the<i> Phoenix.</i>

352
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,667
Yes, and accomplishing nothing,
I'm sorry to say.

353
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:37,834
Can you show me the location

354
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,166
of our other ships?

355
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,542
Mr. Data?

356
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,625
MACET:
There, you see?

357
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,417
We have a warship
which could intercept

358
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,375
the<i> Phoenix</i> before it's too late

359
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:50,917
<i>if</i> you will give us
the transponder frequency.

360
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:53,542
Or are you going
to stand there

361
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,875
while our ship
is destroyed, Captain?

362
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,083
Mr. Worf

363
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,500
has there been
any response
to our hails?

364
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:11,083
No, Captain.

365
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,125
PICARD:
Very well.

366
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,333
Mr. Worf...

367
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,542
relay the prefix codes
of the<i> Phoenix</i>

368
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,542
to the Cardassian warship.

369
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,083
Sir, they
will be able

370
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,458
to dismantle its shields.

371
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,792
The<i> Phoenix</i>
will not have a chance.

372
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:39,458
I cannot allow Maxwell
to ambush that supply ship.

373
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,500
Mr. Worf, now!

374
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,917
Yes, Captain.

375
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,166
Sir, the Cardassian
warship is moving
on the<i> Phoenix.</i>

376
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,959
Mr. Data, overlay

377
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,250
weapon ranges
of the two ships.

378
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,583
The warship is 300,000
kilometers from the<i> Phoenix.</i>

379
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,917
It is opening fire.

380
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:16,125
The<i> Phoenix</i> has taken
a direct hit.

381
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,834
The<i> Phoenix</i>
is beginning
evasive maneuvers.

382
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,917
It has positioned
itself outside

383
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,208
the weapons range
of the opposing ship.

384
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,291
The<i> Phoenix</i> has
powered up

385
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,458
both phasers and
photon torpedoes.

386
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,709
The<i> Phoenix</i> is firing
photon torpedoes.

387
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,250
He has destroyed our warship.

388
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,250
Does the supply ship
have any weapons?

389
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,709
Very limited.

390
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,333
Certainly not enough

391
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,458
to defeat
a Nebula-class starship.

392
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,875
DATA:
Sir, the<i> Phoenix</i> is firing
on them.

393
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:03,750
The warship carried
a crew of 600.

394
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:06,792
The supply ship,
50.

395
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:11,166
Mr. Data, estimated time
to intercept with the<i> Phoenix?</i>

396
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,667
At our present speed
of warp four

397
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:15,458
16 hours, 44 minutes.

398
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,959
Ensign, increase
to warp nine.

399
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,417
Captain.

400
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:38,000
Chief, I wanted
to talk to you.

401
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,959
Anything I can do, sir.
You know that.

402
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,041
Ben Maxwell--

403
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,375
he must be quite a man.

404
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:45,750
He's a rare
one, all right.

405
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,625
I count myself
lucky, sir.

406
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:50,875
I've served with the
two finest Captains
in Starfleet.

407
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,291
From your knowledge
of the man

408
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,583
what has gone wrong?

409
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,542
Well, there's a reason
for what he's doing.

410
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,834
Those Cardassians
were up to something.

411
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,125
I'm sure of it.

412
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,834
When his family was killed,
how did he take it?

413
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,125
I'd say he took it well.

414
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,625
Oh, I know
he was broken up inside.

415
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:13,959
Who wouldn't be?

416
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,291
But you'd never
know it to see him.

417
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,583
He never missed a minute's duty.

418
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,166
Always had a smile, a joke.

419
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,291
Hmm. I see.

420
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,250
He would never
retaliate out
of vengeance

421
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,333
no matter what
that Cardassian says

422
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,333
They're up to
something, sir.

423
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,917
They're the ones you
should be investigating

424
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,208
not Captain Maxwell.

425
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,208
You don't care for
the Cardassians.

426
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,250
Oh, I like them fine.

427
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,250
It's just...

428
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,208
Well, I know them.

429
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,000
You learn to watch
your back when you're
around those people.

430
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:49,166
Ben Maxwell has just sent
more than 600 of them

431
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,208
to their deaths.

432
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,250
I don't know
what to say, sir

433
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,375
but he must have had
his reasons.

434
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:59,250
(<i> sighs</i> )

435
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,542
I think...

436
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,875
when one has been angry
for a very long time

437
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:05,166
one gets used to it.

438
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,834
And it becomes
comfortable

439
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,125
like...
like old leather.

440
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,166
And finally...

441
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,709
it becomes so familiar

442
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,959
that one can't ever remember
feeling any other way.

443
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,208
Thank you, Chief.

444
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,250
<i>Kanar.</i>

445
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,250
Mind if I join you?

446
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,375
You want another?

447
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,250
And an ale.

448
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,208
<i>Kanar.</i>

449
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,583
I never could develop
a taste for it.

450
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,583
It takes a bit
of getting used to.

451
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,792
I wanted to say I...

452
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,333
I owe you an apology.

453
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:23,000
I shouldn't have
popped off like that

454
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,458
in the turbolift.

455
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,750
I think...

456
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,959
Here's your ale,
Mr. O'Brien.

457
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,417
This has been hard
on all of us.

458
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,166
I know I'll be happy

459
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,917
when I'm back
on my own ship.

460
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,542
I guess that's true.

461
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,917
I hadn't thought
about that.

462
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:45,625
I was on Setlik III
with Captain Maxwell

463
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,875
the morning after
the massacre.

464
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,834
We were too late,
of course.

465
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

466
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,625
Almost everyone was dead.

467
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:59,625
That was a terrible mistake.

468
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:03,208
We were told the outpost
was a launching place

469
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,917
for a massive attack

470
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:06,417
against us.

471
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,667
The only people left alive

472
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:14,417
were in an outlying
district of the settlement.

473
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,959
I was sent there
with a squad to
reinforce them.

474
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,875
The Cardassians
were advancing on us...

475
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:27,041
moving through the streets,
destroying, killing.

476
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,667
I was with a group
of women and children

477
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:33,417
when two Cardassian soldiers
burst in.

478
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,458
I stunned one of them.

479
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,417
The other one jumped me.

480
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:40,208
We struggled.

481
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,709
One of the women threw me
a phaser

482
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,667
and I fired.

483
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:58,208
The phaser was set at maximum.

484
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,625
The man just...

485
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,709
just incinerated there

486
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,208
before my eyes.

487
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,166
I'd never killed
anything before.

488
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,125
When I was a kid

489
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:16,166
I'd worry
about swatting a mosquito.

490
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:25,583
It's not<i> you</i> I hate, Cardassian.

491
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,083
I hate what<i> I</i> became

492
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,083
because of you.

493
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,875
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

494
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,917
I will protest
this, Klingon.

495
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,000
Lieutenant?

496
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,917
He was found
at a computer station on deck 35

497
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:50,417
attempting to access information
on<i> our</i> weapons systems.

498
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,834
TELLE:
A lie,
Gul Macet.

499
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:55,333
I was studying
the terminal
interface systems.

500
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,291
They're more
efficient
than ours.

501
00:25:57,333 --> 00:26:00,875
I have no idea
what was in
the files.

502
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,875
What business did you have

503
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:07,500
going near
one of their computers?

504
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:12,417
But, Gul Macet,
I meant nothing.

505
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,166
There was no harm done.

506
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,542
Go to your quarters.

507
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,250
You're confined there

508
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,750
for the duration
of this expedition.

509
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:23,166
As you wish.

510
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,583
Sir.

511
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,500
PICARD:
Mr. Worf,
please accompany him.

512
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,500
WORF:
Gladly, Captain.

513
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:44,083
Captain, may we
speak in private?

514
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,667
You have the Bridge,
Number One.

515
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:57,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

516
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,125
I deeply regret

517
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,250
what my aide
has done, Captain.

518
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:03,875
You have my word
he will be disciplined

519
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,208
upon my return.

520
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,583
You may take whatever action
against him

521
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,583
you feel is appropriate.

522
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,041
I consider the matter closed.

523
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,834
I'm not sure
I would be so generous

524
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,583
in your place, Captain.

525
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,208
Thank you.

526
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,625
If there is to be
a lasting peace, Gul Macet

527
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:22,166
neither you nor I must allow
any one man

528
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,375
to undermine
our efforts.

529
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:36,166
There are those who...

530
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,417
crave war--

531
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,834
who need it.

532
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:43,834
I am not one of them, Captain

533
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:47,000
and I'm beginning to see

534
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,208
that neither are you.

535
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,500
We have had
our full measure.

536
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:56,208
The lasting peace begins here

537
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,625
with the two of us.

538
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,542
DATA:
Bridge to Captain.

539
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,166
Picard here.

540
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,083
We have located
the<i> Phoenix,</i> sir.

541
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:06,625
We will intercept it
in 22 minutes.

542
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,542
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44431.7.</i>

543
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:20,792
<i>We have established</i>
<i>communication</i>

544
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,208
<i>with Captain Maxwell</i>

545
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,083
<i>and he has agreed</i>
<i>to come on board.</i>

546
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,417
Welcome aboard, sir.

547
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,333
I'm Commander Riker,
First Officer.

548
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:35,417
I know all about
you, Commander.

549
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,917
Fine work you did
with the Borg.

550
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:39,375
We all owe you
on that one.

551
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,959
Thank you, sir.

552
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,208
O'Brien?

553
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,250
Miles O'Brien?

554
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,166
Hello, Captain.

555
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,333
Good to see
you again.
How are you?

556
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,792
I had no idea you were
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

557
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:52,583
This was my tactical officer
on the<i> Rutledge.</i>

558
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,333
Best I ever had.

559
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:55,458
Thank you, sir.

560
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,166
O'Brien has
the ability

561
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,500
to size up a situation instantly

562
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:02,875
then come up with options
to fit all contingencies.

563
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:05,542
Remarkable!
Well, if that's true,
I learned it from you, sir.

564
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,041
(<i> in Irish brogue</i> ):
But you got that silver tongue

565
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,250
by kissing the stone

566
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:12,792
right?

567
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,166
Well, Commander, best I see
your Captain straight away.

568
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,208
We've got a lot to talk about.

569
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,959
Yes, sir.

570
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:37,625
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

571
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,750
Captain Benjamin Maxwell.

572
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:42,250
That will be
all, Commander.

573
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,458
Captain.

574
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,041
A pleasure, Captain.

575
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:49,041
Please sit down.

576
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:54,375
You must think
I've gone mad.

577
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:58,709
The thought
had occurred.

578
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,792
Picard, I have to tell you.

579
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:04,333
I was grateful
when I realized it was<i> you</i>

580
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:05,959
Starfleet had sent after me--

581
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,208
someone who knows
what it's really
like out here.

582
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,375
I know of nothing out here
that could possibly justify

583
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:13,417
what you
have done.

584
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:15,625
Then listen to this.

585
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:18,667
The Cardassians
are arming again.

586
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:20,792
That so-called
science station?

587
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:23,834
Military supply port.

588
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,291
How do you know this?

589
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,417
Information comes my way.

590
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,250
From whom?

591
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,041
Where is your documentation?

592
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,792
I know
what they're doing!

593
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:36,000
I can smell it.

594
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:39,625
There's no good reason
for a science station

595
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,333
in the Cuellar system.

596
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,375
But it's
a hell of a strategic site

597
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,458
for a military
transport station--

598
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,333
a jumping-off point
into three Federation sectors.

599
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,542
They're running
supply ships
back and forth.

600
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,875
And nobody's going to tell me
it's for scientific research.

601
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:57,500
But whatever circumstances
you encountered

602
00:30:57,542 --> 00:30:59,208
why didn't you notify Starfleet?

603
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,166
(<i> scoffs</i> ):
And wait six months

604
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,458
while the bureaucrats
sit around reading reports

605
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,959
trying to figure out
what to do?

606
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,041
They don't know
what's going on out here.

607
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,083
But you should, Picard.

608
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,125
You know what it's like
to be under fire.

609
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,959
You weren't under fire.

610
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,542
Lives were at stake.

611
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,500
Whose lives?

612
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,542
We had to act now!

613
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,959
Why?

614
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:33,083
Smells musty in here...

615
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:36,291
like a bureaucrat's office.

616
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:39,166
You have killed
nearly 700 people

617
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:42,625
and you have taken us
to the brink of war.

618
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,291
I have prevented war

619
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:47,458
or at the very least delayed it
a good long time.

620
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,583
The peace treaty was a ruse,
to give them breathing room

621
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,208
time to regroup.

622
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,667
And so, all alone, you decided
to dispose of the treaty.

623
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:57,500
I took the initiative.

624
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,542
I did what had to be done.

625
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,375
What had to be done?

626
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:04,166
Hmm? For whom?

627
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:05,750
Why would a man

628
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:09,041
with a long
and brilliant service

629
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,166
abandon
the fundamental principles

630
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,583
that he has believed in--
even fought for--

631
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:16,333
all of his life?

632
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,917
Well, I believe

633
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:21,000
it is because of what they did
to your wife

634
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:21,959
and your children.

635
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,542
Not true...
not true.

636
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,125
To avenge
their deaths.

637
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:35,041
You're a fool, Picard.

638
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:39,041
History will look at you
and say, "This man was a fool."

639
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,792
I'll accept the judgment
of history.

640
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:46,458
When it becomes clear
what the Cardassians have done

641
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,417
I will be vindicated.

642
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:52,375
What the Cardassians have
or have not done is irrelevant.

643
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:55,250
Irrelevant?!

644
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:57,083
Then come with me.

645
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:58,208
Find one of their supply ships

646
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,208
and we'll see

647
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,250
how "irrelevant"
it is.

648
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:03,792
We're not going after

649
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:06,041
any more
Cardassian ships.

650
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,417
You're going
to return to your Bridge

651
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:14,083
and set a course
for Starbase 211.

652
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,250
The<i> Phoenix</i> and the
<i>Enterprise</i> will return

653
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:18,583
to Federation
space together.

654
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,458
Those are
Starfleet's orders.

655
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,291
I will permit
you the dignity

656
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:28,750
of retaining your command
during the voyage

657
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:32,458
but the only alternative
is to put you in the brig

658
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,917
and to tow your ship back
to the Starbase in disgrace.

659
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,583
I will return to my ship.

660
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:48,041
You understand
your orders?

661
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,000
Yes, Captain.

662
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:53,417
Mr. Worf, report
to my ready room.

663
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,208
My guest is departing.

664
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,291
Aye, sir.

665
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,750
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

666
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:10,542
<i>With the</i> Phoenix
<i>in close formation</i>

667
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:14,291
<i>we are proceeding directly</i>
<i>to Starbase 211.</i>

668
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,959
Mr. Data, how long until
we clear Cardassian space?

669
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,291
At our present speed

670
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:20,208
three hours,
20 minutes, sir.

671
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,625
Mr. Worf, send a message
to Admiral Haden at Starfleet.

672
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,625
Inform them of
our projected time of arrival.

673
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:27,083
Aye, sir.

674
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:30,709
Captain, the<i> Phoenix</i>
has changed course.

675
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:38,041
What is he doing?

676
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:40,125
Ensign, change course to pursue.

677
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:42,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

678
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,959
Mr. Worf, will you hail
Captain Maxwell?

679
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,959
No response, Captain.

680
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,041
Data, project his new course.

681
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,458
The<i> Phoenix</i> is headed directly
for a Cardassian vessel

682
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
.12 light-years
from our location.

683
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:58,166
He'll attack that ship,
just as he did the others.

684
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,959
PICARD:
Continue the hail,
Mr. Worf.

685
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,375
Priority one message.

686
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:05,083
Do you know
what that ship might be?

687
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:08,291
I imagine it's a supply ship

688
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:11,417
headed for the research station
in the Kelrabi system.

689
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:14,291
The<i> Phoenix</i> still
does not respond, sir.

690
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,583
Ensign, warp eight.
Overtake him.

691
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:20,166
Captain, the<i> Phoenix</i> has
accelerated to warp nine.

692
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,500
We will not be able to reach him

693
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:23,041
before he intercepts
the Cardassian vessel.

694
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:24,458
Ensign, warp nine.

695
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,000
Aye, sir.

696
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,709
Mr. Worf, arm phasers.

697
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,667
Continue the hail.

698
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,458
Aye, sir.

699
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,375
Captain, Chief O'Brien was
Maxwell's tactical officer.

700
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:36,166
Get him up here.

701
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:42,417
DATA:
Sir, the<i> Phoenix</i> has
dropped out of warp.

702
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,709
They have reached
the Cardassian vessel.

703
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,291
RIKER:
Slow to impulse.

704
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,208
Vessels are within visual range.

705
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,834
On screen.

706
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:52,917
RIKER:
Has the<i> Phoenix</i>

707
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:53,875
activated
its weapons systems?

708
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:55,166
DATA:
Negative, sir.

709
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:57,083
Their phaser banks
are not armed.

710
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,625
What about
the Cardassians?

711
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:01,208
Sensors are unable
to determine the status

712
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,333
of the Cardassian
defensive systems.

713
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:07,583
Their ship is running
with a high-powered
subspace field.

714
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:13,834
Mr. O'Brien,
your former Commander

715
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,750
a Federation Captain,
is about to place me

716
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,667
in the position
of firing on his ship.

717
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,625
I need your knowledge
of the man

718
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:22,667
how he thinks,
what he's capable of doing.

719
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:23,834
Aye, sir.

720
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:26,625
Sir, Captain Maxwell
is hailing us.

721
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,959
On screen.

722
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,959
MAXWELL:
All right, Picard.

723
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,041
You need proof?
You've got it now.

724
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:38,208
Captain Maxwell, you have
disobeyed a direct order.

725
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,750
Board the ship.

726
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:42,542
You'll see that everything
I've been saying is true.

727
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:45,417
The Cardassian vessel
will not be boarded.

728
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:49,083
You will transport yourself
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

729
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:53,166
Picard, if you don't board
that ship

730
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:55,083
I'll destroy it.

731
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:58,291
And I will use
whatever force is necessary

732
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:01,583
to prevent you from taking
that action, Captain.

733
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,041
Sir, Captain Maxwell--

734
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,709
if he feels his back
is against the wall

735
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,166
he'll strike.

736
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:13,834
Captain, the<i> Phoenix</i>
is transferring power

737
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:14,875
to its shields.

738
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:16,083
WORF:
They are arming phasers

739
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,000
and loading forward
torpedo bays.

740
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,291
Red Alert.

741
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,792
Seems you were right,
Mr. O'Brien.

742
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,625
Ready phasers,
load torpedoes.

743
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:23,792
Phasers armed.

744
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:25,875
Loading forward and
aft torpedo bays.

745
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:28,000
O'BRIEN:
Sir, let me
beam over.

746
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,041
Try to talk to him.

747
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,667
We served together a long time.

748
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:34,250
When you've been through
what we have, you tend

749
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:35,583
to get inside someone.

750
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:36,959
He might listen.

751
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,166
He'd never lower
his shields

752
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,792
and allow you
to transport on board.

753
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:42,750
The<i> Phoenix</i> is using
a high-energy sensor system.

754
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:45,291
It cycles
every 5.5 minutes.

755
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:46,792
Between cycles,
there's a window

756
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,166
of a 50th of a second.

757
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:50,583
Trust me.
I can get through.

758
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:52,625
Make it so.

759
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,959
(<i> doorbell chimes</i> )

760
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,041
Not now!

761
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:11,083
I'm not armed.

762
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,834
How the devil
did you get over here?

763
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,917
I had the thought
that if we could talk

764
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:19,959
we could figure a way
out of this mess.

765
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,709
The way out of this is clear.

766
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,125
Talk to Picard.

767
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,959
Get him to board the damn ship.

768
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,917
He won't do that, sir.

769
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:29,709
But he'd turn his weapons
on a Federation starship

770
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,917
to protect the enemy?

771
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:32,625
I don't
believe it.

772
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:33,625
He will.

773
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:35,500
Count on it.

774
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:39,417
What the hell has happened
to this war?

775
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:42,166
Sir...

776
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:45,208
there is no war.

777
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,291
The war is over.

778
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,041
You're wrong.

779
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,709
The Cardassians live
to make war.

780
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,667
That's what everybody thinks
about the enemy.

781
00:38:58,709 --> 00:39:01,750
That's probably what
they think about us.

782
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:03,125
We're not
the same at all.

783
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:05,542
We do not<i> start</i> wars.

784
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,458
We do not make surprise
attacks on manned outposts.

785
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,583
We do not butcher women and
children in their homes.

786
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,041
Children...

787
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:24,166
who never had the
chance to grow up.

788
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:33,208
You were with me on Setlik.

789
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,125
You saw
what they did.

790
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,750
Yes, sir.

791
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,125
What was the name
of that fellow

792
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,417
who always hung around you
like a puppy?

793
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:50,542
Will Kayden.

794
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,166
Stompie.

795
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:56,291
Stompie!

796
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:59,458
Stompie!

797
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,542
As cool under fire
as a mountain lake.

798
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,542
Yes, sir.

799
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:13,959
He died at Setlik,
didn't he?

800
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,875
Yes, sir.

801
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,500
What was that song of his?

802
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:23,709
The one he always sang?

803
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,375
The one I liked?

804
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:32,875
âª The minstrel boy
to the war has gone âª

805
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:39,291
âª In the ranks of death
you will find him âª

806
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:45,000
BOTH:
âª His father's sword
he hath girded on âª

807
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:51,625
âª And his wild harp
slung behind him âª

808
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:57,083
âª "Land of song,"
said the warrior bard âª

809
00:40:57,125 --> 00:41:04,500
âª "Though all the world
betrays thee âª

810
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:10,834
âª "One sword, at least,
thy rights shall guard âª

811
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:18,166
O'BRIEN:
âª One faithful harp
shall praise thee." âª

812
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm not going to win
this one, am I, Chief?

813
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,542
No, sir.

814
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:47,417
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

815
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:50,041
<i>Captain Maxwell has turned his</i>
<i>ship over to his First Officer</i>

816
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:52,083
<i>and transported</i>
<i>aboard the</i> Enterprise.

817
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:56,041
<i>I have confined him to quarters</i>
<i>for the return voyage.</i>

818
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,083
Thank you, Chief.

819
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,583
I'd just like
to say, sir

820
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,375
he was a good man.

821
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:05,959
What he did was
terribly wrong

822
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,375
I know that now

823
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:10,583
but I'm still proud
to have served with him.

824
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:12,834
Thank you, Chief.

825
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,959
And well done.

826
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,917
That'll be all.

827
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:23,792
Well, his loyalty is admirable

828
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:26,667
even if it is misplaced.

829
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:32,000
The loyalty that you would
so quickly dismiss

830
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:35,375
does not come easily
to my people, Gul Macet.

831
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:37,959
You have much to learn
about us.

832
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,709
Benjamin Maxwell
<i>earned</i> the loyalty

833
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,667
of those who served
with him.

834
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:48,709
You know, in war,
he was twice honored

835
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,375
with the Federation's
highest citation

836
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:54,083
for courage
and valor.

837
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:58,291
And if he could not find
a role for himself in peace

838
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:03,667
we can pity him, but we
shall not dismiss him.

839
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:06,792
You are welcome to
your opinion, Captain.

840
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:12,333
I, for one, am grateful
he is under lock and key.

841
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:15,041
One more thing,
Gul Macet.

842
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,458
Maxwell was right.

843
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,417
Those ships were not carrying
scientific equipment, were they?

844
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:27,208
A research station
within arm's reach

845
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,917
of three Federation sectors?

846
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:31,667
Cargo ships running

847
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,875
with high-energy
subspace fields

848
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:36,750
that jam sensors?

849
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:39,166
If you believe
the transport ship

850
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:41,458
was carrying
weapons, Captain

851
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,166
why didn't you board it

852
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:45,875
as Maxwell
requested?

853
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,083
I was here
to protect the peace--

854
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:53,583
a peace that I firmly believe
is in the interest

855
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:55,750
of both
our peoples.

856
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:57,792
If I had attempted
to board that ship

857
00:43:57,834 --> 00:43:59,250
I'm quite certain that you and I

858
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:02,500
would not be having
this pleasant conversation

859
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:07,000
and that ships on both sides
would now be arming for war.

860
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:09,375
Captain, I assure you...

861
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:12,417
Take this message
to your leaders, Gul Macet.

862
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:16,041
We'll be watching.
