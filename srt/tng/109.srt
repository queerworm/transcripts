00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:06,750
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41723.9.</i>

2
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:08,625
<i>In response</i>
<i>to a Starfleet order,</i>

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:11,000
<i>we are in the Xendi Sabu</i>
<i>star system</i>

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:13,500
<i>having rendezvoused</i>
<i>with a Ferengi vessel</i>

5
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:15,542
<i>which has requested a meeting.</i>

6
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,333
<i>Although we arrived here</i>

7
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,583
<i>and made appropriate signals</i>
<i>to the Ferengi three days ago</i>

8
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:22,041
<i>they have so far responded only</i>
<i>with the message,</i>

9
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,959
<i>"Stand by,</i> Enterprise."

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,500
<i>( door chime )</i>

11
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:31,542
You sent for me, sir?

12
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,250
Yes, doctor.

13
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,583
Sit down.

14
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,667
Um, look...

15
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,667
this, perhaps,
may be nothing

16
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:48,458
but I've been feeling
a bit odd of late.

17
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:52,792
Uh, fatigued.

18
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,792
And now I've got
this damned headache.

19
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:55,834
A what?

20
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,458
Headache, headache.

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,083
Surely you know
what a headache is.

22
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,625
Of course.

23
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:03,709
But I don't often
encounter them.

24
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,083
The reason is
obvious, of course.

25
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,291
What are the Ferengi up to?

26
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,709
"Stand by,<i> Enterprise."</i>

27
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,417
Stand by for what?

28
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,834
I don't see a thing wrong.

29
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,208
No, neither can i--

30
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,542
unless they're baiting
some kind of trap.

31
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:21,417
With your head.

32
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,208
I see nothing
physically wrong.

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,333
But I want to run some
additional scans in Sick Bay.

34
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,667
Doctor, all I've got is...

35
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:29,792
Is an order to report
to Sick Bay

36
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,375
from the only
person aboard this ship

37
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:33,667
who<i> can</i> give you an order.

38
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,333
RIKER:
Captain from first officer.

39
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,333
They're finally
sending a message.

40
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,709
On my way, Number One.

41
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,959
Sorry, doctor.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,333
Duty calls.

43
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,917
RIKER:
They're prepared
to talk, sir.

44
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,834
Have they given any hint of
what they've been waiting for?

45
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,959
Negative, captain.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,250
They've identified their
commander as Bok.

47
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,667
DaiMon Bok.

48
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,458
You'll be able
to see him now, sir.

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,750
They're willing to communicate
on visual.

50
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:59,083
Open hailing
frequencies.

51
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,709
TASHA:
Frequencies open, sir.

52
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,208
Ferengi vessel, this is
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

53
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,166
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

54
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,250
We are transmitting visually.

55
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:11,333
Is this<i> the</i> Captain Picard?

56
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,667
Do we know each other?

57
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,709
I know you, Picard.

58
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,583
Then you have
the advantage of me.

59
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,500
Is this Bok?

60
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:24,083
I am Bok,
DaiMon of the Ferengi.

61
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,792
I have asked you here

62
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:29,542
to discuss a mutual
problem, Captain.

63
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,500
What problem is that,
DaiMon Bok?

64
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:36,875
I insist on speaking
of that matter in person.

65
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:39,375
Shall we meet
on your vessel

66
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:40,834
or mine?

67
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,041
Hailing frequencies
closed.

68
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,000
Captain, I sense considerable
deception on Bok's part.

69
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,417
And danger!

70
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,583
Then we should
meet him here.

71
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,875
Keep him under
our control.

72
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,458
Now open, sir.

73
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,458
I appreciate your offer,
DaiMon Bok.

74
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,375
We would like you
to be our guest here?

75
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,125
As you wish, Picard.

76
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:09,500
Perhaps this will begin
a new era of cooperation

77
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,166
for both our people.

78
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,750
In one Earth hour, then?

79
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,959
In one hour, DaiMon Bok.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,917
End transmission.

81
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:23,208
I can't believe
they're coming here.

82
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,959
They did agree
a bit easily.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,959
In one hour,
we shall know why.

84
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:00,583
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

85
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:04,500
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

86
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,750
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

87
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:11,125
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

88
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:15,792
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

89
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:19,792
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

90
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,208
Are you always accustomed to
getting your own way, Doctor?

91
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,083
Only when my way
makes sense, Captain.

92
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,583
There's still 40 minutes
until the Ferengi beam over.

93
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,458
I'll have these scans
done in 10.

94
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,750
Seems an awful lot of effort

95
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:38,542
for something as simple
as a headache.

96
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,875
As simple?

97
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,083
You should
not have a headache

98
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,291
unless there's
something wrong, sir.

99
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,625
It may be true that headaches
were once quite common.

100
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,792
That was in the days before
the brain was charted,

101
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:50,166
before we understood
the nature of pain.

102
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,000
When we were suffering
from things

103
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,542
such as the common cold.

104
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,417
So what's the cause
of my headache?

105
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,375
I haven't the slightest idea.

106
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:05,208
Feel better?

107
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,000
The pain's gone.

108
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,333
Medical fakery.

109
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,125
The pain is actually
still there.

110
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,625
It's just cloaked.

111
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,750
I'll want further exams.

112
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,125
Doctor...

113
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,250
When the Ferengi matter
is settled.

114
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,917
Commander, you'll soon
be getting an intruder alert.

115
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,083
What? Wesley, if you've
something to report...

116
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,458
If you'll scan heading 44 mark
163, Lieutenant, you'll find...

117
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,000
TASHA:
Intruder alert, sir.

118
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,208
I've got something, sir.

119
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,875
It's an old-style starship, sir.

120
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:41,750
Constellation class, heading
this way under impulse power.

121
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:44,458
Says who?

122
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,083
Ensign, answer
the first officer's question.

123
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,750
Says the long-distance
sensors, sir.

124
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,250
I was in Engineering,
playing around

125
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,542
with boosting
the sensor output...

126
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,792
Boosting it?

127
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:56,166
How?

128
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,500
We will discuss this later.

129
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm reading it now, sir.

130
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,125
It's a constellation class
starship heading this way

131
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,125
under impulse power.

132
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,583
Sending no call letters, sir.

133
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,959
The correct procedure...

134
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,625
What's wrong, sir?

135
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:19,250
Oh, it's nothing. Just a...
just a mild headache.

136
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,417
The correct procedure,
Ensign,

137
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,458
would have been
to signal the bridge of
your finding immediately.

138
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,750
Yes, sir.

139
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:28,041
Bringing it
here personally--

140
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,291
perhaps with the idea of being

141
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,166
on hand for the Ferengi
beam over,

142
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,625
might have
imperiled this vessel

143
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,333
had it been something
hostile approaching.

144
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,709
Yes, sir.

145
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,959
We are receiving
no signal at all

146
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,125
from the approaching starship,
sir.

147
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,333
Time, sir.

148
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,125
Time?

149
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,208
Oh, for the Ferengi beam over.

150
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,959
Do you see
any problem connected

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,166
with this old starship
coming in, Number One?

152
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,542
Suggest it would be safer, sir,

153
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,917
to have the Ferengi here
whatever happened.

154
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,125
Hmm, concur.
Stand by.

155
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,959
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

156
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,834
Welcome in peace
to the<i> Enterprise,</i> DaiMon Bok.

157
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,542
It is our pleasure,
Captain Picard.

158
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:21,250
Might I introduce
my first officer, Kazago

159
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,792
and my second, Rata.

160
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:28,333
This is my first officer,
Commander William Riker.

161
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,333
Second in command, Data.

162
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,542
Counselor Troi...

163
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,291
We have heard that
you use females.

164
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,625
Clothed females!

165
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,750
Most interesting.

166
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,750
They are that, sir.

167
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:45,041
And the android
was mentioned, too.

168
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,208
What is its price?

169
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,750
We should like
to purchase it.

170
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,834
He is not for sale.

171
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:55,750
Commander Data
is, um... is, um...

172
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:59,041
Is secondhand merchandise.
You wouldn't want him.

173
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,750
Secondhand, sir?

174
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,625
Oh, of course,
a human joke.

175
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,709
Excuse me,
Captain.

176
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,208
But the unidentified
starship is coming in.

177
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,834
Still no signal at all.

178
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,542
Think nothing of it.

179
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,000
It is under our control.

180
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,917
One of our starships
under your control?

181
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,333
Do not be alarmed, Captain.

182
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,250
It is a gift from us

183
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,041
with which we honor
the hero of Maxia.

184
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,333
Who?

185
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,083
Why you, Picard,
of course.

186
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:38,208
Do you not remember
the Battle of Maxia?

187
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,083
I'm sorry. I do not
remember it, DaiMon Bok.

188
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,333
Data?

189
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,083
Captain, he may refer
to an encounter

190
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,250
which occurred nine years ago
in the Maxia Zeta star system,

191
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,083
in which an unidentified
starship...

192
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,083
Unidentified?!

193
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,750
That fine vessel was Ferengi.

194
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:59,083
Which you destroyed, sir.

195
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,250
The Battle of Maxia.

196
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,834
I've never heard it referred to
so dramatically before.

197
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,834
My sincere regrets, Bok,

198
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,417
but that vessel
refused to identify itself.

199
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,583
It simply attacked us.
We defended ourselves.

200
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:20,458
Such mistakes happen in space.

201
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,000
Hardly a mistake, sir.

202
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,625
Your report shows that
it deliberately attacked.

203
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,750
TASHA:
Do you want arriving vessel
on main viewer, sir?

204
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,125
It's only 1,000 kilometers
away now.

205
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,834
Put it on your viewer.

206
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,417
Main viewer.

207
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,458
There is no one aboard it.

208
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,792
The logs will be downloaded

209
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:39,834
into the<i> Enterprise's</i>
records...

210
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,500
at a price.

211
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,500
No price!

212
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,083
No price?

213
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,834
What is the purpose of this?

214
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,166
What...

215
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,208
I just felt
something too, Captain

216
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,083
Perhaps it is...
his conscience.

217
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,333
Bridge to Sick Bay.

218
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,667
No, no, I'm fine.

219
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:07,458
It felt as if... as if it were
something from your past.

220
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,709
It's all right.
I'm fine.

221
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:14,667
What is all this about?

222
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:19,166
It is about the battle
I mentioned, Captain.

223
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:23,333
A gift in honor
of that occasion.

224
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,709
Look at that ship closely.

225
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,041
Magnify please,
Lieutenant La Forge.

226
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,208
Aye, sir.

227
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,917
Why?

228
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,583
That's the<i> Stargazer.</i>

229
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,083
That's my old ship.

230
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,166
How did you find it?

231
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,667
It was a derelict.

232
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,667
Adrift in space
on the far side

233
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:56,166
of this star system.

234
00:11:56,208 --> 00:12:00,917
How it got there
is none of my business, Captain.

235
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,917
But now that vessel
is yours

236
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,792
if you wish to have it.

237
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,542
We are not selling it
to him.

238
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:16,041
Consider it an act
of friendship.

239
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,500
At no cost?!

240
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:20,875
Oh, ugly.

241
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:23,166
Very ugly!

242
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,041
<i>Captain's log, supplemental:</i>

243
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,583
<i>Bok and his officers have</i>
<i>returned to their vessel</i>

244
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,875
<i>inviting us now</i>
<i>to officially take possession</i>

245
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:37,291
<i>of the</i> Stargazer.

246
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,041
Like before?

247
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,709
No, it hit with more impact.

248
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,208
Hit?

249
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,583
I'm sorry, but anything
could be important.

250
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,709
You said you felt
something yourself.

251
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,250
I believe so.

252
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:52,291
Like a thought but
rather mechanical in nature.

253
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,041
Are you sure it wasn't one
of my thoughts?

254
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,000
At that moment,
I was remembering

255
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,875
being at the helm
of the<i> Stargazer.</i>

256
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:01,542
A maneuver was being made.

257
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,166
We were hit.

258
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,208
Something's burning.

259
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,667
I can smell smoke.
Can you smell it?

260
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:12,667
There's nothing burning,
Jean-Luc.

261
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,792
That was just part
of my memory.

262
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:21,375
Memory or nightmare?

263
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:24,375
Well, it was strong,
whatever it was.

264
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:25,709
You ready, Number One?

265
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,625
Staff's waiting,
if Dr. Crusher approves.

266
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,041
I'll do better than that.

267
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,834
I'll go along.

268
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,875
We were traveling at warp 2
through the Maxia Zeta system

269
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,875
and this unidentified starship
suddenly appeared

270
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,667
and fired on us--
point-blank range.

271
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:43,542
RIKER:
Where did it come from?

272
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,750
It must have been lying
in some deep moon crater.

273
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,959
First attack damaged
the shields.

274
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,709
In the confusion, they hit us
a second time.

275
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,166
TASHA:
No clue who they were?

276
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,041
No names, no reason.

277
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,250
Can you identify them, Vigo?

278
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,417
If they come in
a second time

279
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,667
with our shields
damaged...

280
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,500
Sir, who's Vigo?

281
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,000
He's my weapons officer
on the<i> Stargazer.</i>

282
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,291
Hey, I'm getting quite
caught up in this.

283
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,250
Your shields were failing, sir.

284
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,500
Mm-hmm, I, uh, improvised.

285
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,542
With the enemy vessel
coming in for the kill,

286
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,792
I ordered a sensor bearing

287
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,500
and when it came
into the return arc...

288
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:26,125
You performed what Starfleet
textbooks now refer to as

289
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,750
<i>The Picard Maneuver.</i>

290
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:29,917
Well, I did what any good
helmsman would have done.

291
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:31,291
I dropped into high warp,

292
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,667
stopped right off
the enemy vessel's bow,

293
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,542
and fired with everything
I had.

294
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,291
And blowing into
maximum warp speed

295
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:41,083
you appeared for an instant,
to be in two places at once.

296
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,375
And our attacker fired
on the wrong one.

297
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:46,333
"I did what any good helmsman
would have done."

298
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,792
You did it first, sir.

299
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:50,250
It was a save-our-skins
maneuver.

300
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,208
We were finished, on fire.

301
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,792
We had to abandon ship.

302
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:59,917
We limped through space
in shuttlecraft for weeks

303
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,458
before we were picked up.

304
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,750
Well, I haven't thought
about this for years.

305
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:09,041
Sir, the Ferengi
are standing by

306
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,250
for us to take possession
of the<i> Stargazer.</i>

307
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,583
I want to go over to her.

308
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,041
I understand, sir.

309
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,750
As soon as my people have
made certain that she's safe.

310
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,667
And after I have another
look at you, Captain.

311
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,333
U.S.S.<i> Stargazer.</i>

312
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:03,417
Constellation class, Starfleet
registry N.C.C. 2893.

313
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,458
I activated the emergency
power cells.

314
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,792
Amazing they still work.

315
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:17,792
The rest of the ship is clear
of surprises, Lieutenant Yar.

316
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,250
You know, when I read about this
ship at the academy,

317
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,875
I never dreamed
I'd ever be on her.

318
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,917
Yar to<i> Enterprise.</i>
<i>All clear, sir.</i>

319
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,625
Hello, old friend.

320
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,917
You'll find this
most intriguing, sir.

321
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,041
What did you find, Data?

322
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,750
Last entry dated
nine years ago, sir-- by you.

323
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:20,041
"We are forced to abandon
our starship.

324
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,208
May she find
her way without us."

325
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,583
Apparently she did, sir.

326
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,458
How do you feel, Captain?

327
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,041
Oh, I'm fine, Doctor.

328
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,542
Lieutenant Yar,

329
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,291
run a structural analysis
on the<i> Stargazer</i>

330
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,000
for impulse tow.

331
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,667
Data, download all computers
to the<i> Enterprise</i> and file.

332
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:45,917
I'm... I'm going to look
at my old cabin.

333
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,041
Try this...

334
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,417
hero of Maxia.

335
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,208
No!

336
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,208
Captain.

337
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,000
Another headache?

338
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,375
This really worries me.

339
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:32,041
I want you back
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

340
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,625
But my things.

341
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,500
I'll see they're sent
to your<i> Enterprise</i> quarters.

342
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:46,834
<i>Enterprise</i> now taking
possession of<i> Stargazer,</i> Kazago.

343
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,917
<i>Permission granted, Riker.</i>

344
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,166
Actually, it was
quite a bargain, Kazago.

345
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,625
I thought the Ferengi always
made a profit on things.

346
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,166
<i>( snarl )</i>

347
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,208
Set sub-warp speed
for towing, La Forge.

348
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,458
Aye, sir.

349
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,250
Starfleet has responded
to our request, sir.

350
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,750
A tug will rendezvous with
us and tow the<i> Stargazer</i>

351
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:13,291
back to Xendi
starbase nine.

352
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,667
Very well, Data.

353
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,041
How was it, Captain?

354
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,792
Very strange, Number One.

355
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:24,542
Like going back to the house
you grew up in

356
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,417
but no one's home

357
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,750
except phantoms
of the past.

358
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,417
It has troubled you.

359
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:34,625
Not half as much
as this damned headache.

360
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,458
Take over, Number One.

361
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:42,166
Aye, sir.

362
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:47,166
What's wrong?

363
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,667
I wish I could say.

364
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,792
<i>Shields weakening, Captain.</i>

365
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,917
<i>Torpedoes armed.</i>

366
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,875
<i>Where are they?</i>

367
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:28,041
<i>Oh, my God, sir!</i>

368
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,125
<i>Fire.</i>
<i>Fire!</i>

369
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,208
What is it, Data?

370
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,000
Why all the mystery?

371
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,083
The records
of the<i> Stargazer,</i> sir.

372
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,750
What the Ferengi call
the Battle of Maxia.

373
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,709
It seems the captain's
personal log contains

374
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,333
a much different version
of that conflict

375
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,500
than the official
historic account.

376
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:54,709
What are you saying?

377
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,125
It would appear

378
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,041
that the starship which
Captain Picard attacked

379
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,667
had in fact
been under a flag of truce.

380
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,208
What?!

381
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,709
And apparently, the captain
destroyed the ship

382
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,709
without notice
or provocation.

383
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,250
Impossible--

384
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,500
well, what about the fire aboard
the<i> Stargazer?</i>

385
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:10,041
An accident in Engineering.

386
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,291
And what proof?

387
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,333
It is logged
in his own voice, sir.

388
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:20,709
Would you care
to hear it, sir?

389
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,166
Sir?

390
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,792
<i>This is a confession</i>
<i>given by me,</i>

391
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:35,458
<i>Jean-Luc Picard, commanding</i>
<i>U.S.S. Stargazer.</i>

392
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,875
What does this mean?

393
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:39,000
I don't know, sir.
It sounds like your voice.

394
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,375
It is, Number One.

395
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:42,709
But I refuse to believe
you ever said that.

396
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,542
<i>I admit I must have</i>
<i>mistaken their subspace antenna</i>

397
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,417
<i>for a weapon's cluster.</i>

398
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:52,667
<i>Unfortunately, I fired our main</i>
<i>phasers and our direct hits</i>

399
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:55,083
<i>destroyed the unknown vessel.</i>

400
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,834
I've assumed they've
simulated your voice somehow.

401
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,375
I've already put Data
to work on it.

402
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:00,583
Thank you, Will.

403
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,959
I never made that log entry,
of course.

404
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,458
But it still leaves you
with a duty to perform.

405
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,208
I know, sir. I must
report to Starfleet.

406
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,917
That's at least
one full day

407
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:14,500
subspace communication
to reach there.

408
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,417
And one more full day
for their answer to return.

409
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,250
I'd like to have the truth
of this by then.

410
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,792
I'd hate to have to
prepare a formal defense.

411
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,750
I can't believe they'd
ask for your command.

412
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:28,208
Why wouldn't they?

413
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,375
With the Ferengi making these
friendship overtures,

414
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:34,166
I could become a severe
embarrassment to Starfleet.

415
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,041
I'm certain the Ferengi
are behind the fake log.

416
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,417
No wonder they're
waiting out there.

417
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,875
Headache back, sir.

418
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:44,208
Damn!

419
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,083
I'll call the doctor again.

420
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,208
There's no wonder with
all this going on.

421
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,333
Try to relax.

422
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,000
<i>This is a confession</i>
<i>given by me,</i>

423
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:04,333
<i>Jean-Luc Picard,</i>
<i>commanding U.S.S. Stargazer.</i>

424
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,709
<i>In the hopes that</i>
<i>my belated honesty</i>

425
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,625
<i>will be taken into account</i>
<i>by Starfleet,</i>

426
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:12,458
<i>when judging my actions</i>
<i>during a confrontation</i>

427
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,417
<i>with an unidentified vessel...</i>

428
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,500
Open hailing frequencies,
Geordi.

429
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:17,667
Opened, sir.

430
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:18,875
I'll take them in
the ready room--

431
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:22,083
Secure channel,
La Forge.

432
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,542
Secure, sir.

433
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,792
Starship Ferengi, this is
Commander Riker here.

434
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:30,625
I'd like to speak to
First Officer Kazago.

435
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,166
<i>A problem, Riker?</i>

436
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,000
Are our channels secure
on your end?

437
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:37,333
It is now.

438
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,917
Are you aware of the details
of the Battle of Maxia?

439
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:42,875
Captain Bok has just
made me aware of it, Riker.

440
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:45,125
The infamy of your Picard
is now fully known.

441
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,875
Infamy?

442
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:51,959
I would call
the wanton destruction
of an unarmed vessel infamy.

443
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,875
And if I produced evidence

444
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,917
that Captain Picard's
log entry was falsified
to indicate that--

445
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:59,375
I can hardly imagine
you contacted me

446
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,625
to discuss an ancient battle.

447
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,083
What do you want of me?

448
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,458
Just one question.

449
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,375
As you humans say,
"I'm all ears."

450
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:11,834
First officer to first
officer, Kazago.

451
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:15,166
If your Captain Bok
knew about this,

452
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,250
then why this peaceful
meeting to present us

453
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,834
with the<i> Stargazer?</i>

454
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,583
We freely give you back
your derelict warship,

455
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,500
and now you accuse us
of crime, Riker?!

456
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:26,834
I can bear no more insults.

457
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,041
Yes, who the hell is it?!

458
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,250
Not resting, Captain.

459
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,875
More like dying, Doctor.

460
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,834
Over here.

461
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,709
What is wrong with me?

462
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,166
I wish to hell
I knew, Captain.

463
00:24:57,208 --> 00:25:00,041
But something unusual
has definitely been
happening to you.

464
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,583
The doctors always say
the obvious

465
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,083
as though it's a revelation.

466
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,709
Why do captains always
act like they're immortal?

467
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,208
No.

468
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,792
(<i> chuckling</i> )

469
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,291
You didn't tell me
it had been this bad.

470
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,750
It wasn't this bad,

471
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:38,208
but it's getting worse.

472
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,709
This should help a little.

473
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:50,125
It's got to be some kind
of emotional pressure

474
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:52,291
connected with the<i> Stargazer.</i>

475
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,667
I got this headache

476
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:58,083
long before I even knew
my old ship still existed.

477
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,667
Still, perhaps you're
partly right.

478
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:07,125
Want to talk about it?

479
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,792
I'm here.

480
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:12,375
A fight, Maxia.

481
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:15,208
I destroyed an entire vessel...

482
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,917
an entire crew.

483
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,000
Did you have a choice?

484
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:21,625
I don't know anymore--

485
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,125
I just don't know!

486
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:28,125
Commander Riker's told me
about the altered log

487
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,542
if that's what's troubling you.

488
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:36,709
The last three nights, I...

489
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,667
have heard these voices.

490
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:44,291
I'm on the bridge
of my old ship.

491
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,125
And there's fire all around me.

492
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:49,875
The klaxons, smoke...

493
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:52,000
and then I give the order.

494
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:56,000
And now the<i> Stargazer</i> is
really here.

495
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,291
And that that log...

496
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,834
Now am I going crazy?

497
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,375
How do I know I was
in my right mind at Maxia?

498
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:07,542
How do I know I'm in
my right mind now?

499
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:21,041
What was that?

500
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,583
Something to let you sleep.

501
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,041
Sleep...

502
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,458
Sleep...

503
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,625
<i>Shields weakening, Captain.</i>

504
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:18,000
<i>Torpedoes armed.</i>

505
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,625
<i>Where are they?</i>

506
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:29,083
<i>( chuckling )</i>

507
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,834
And now, my dear captain,

508
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:34,125
you are ready
to live the past.

509
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,542
<i>Where did he come from?</i>

510
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:41,375
<i>Phasers, sir.</i>

511
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:43,417
<i>Sir?</i>

512
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:46,875
<i>Sir?!</i>

513
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:48,583
<i>What should we do, sir?</i>

514
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,583
<i>Should we fire back?</i>

515
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,291
<i>Fire, Captain.</i>

516
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,166
<i>Fire!</i>

517
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:58,834
You will injure yourself

518
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,542
as you once injured me.

519
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:06,792
<i>Sir!</i>

520
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:10,291
Damage report.

521
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,875
<i>Fusion generator under</i>
<i>surge control, sir!</i>

522
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,542
<i>Power systems failing!</i>

523
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,625
Sensor beam bearing
on hostile ship!

524
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:20,417
<i>7 mark 19, sir.</i>

525
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,417
<i>Phasers, sir?</i>

526
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:23,750
<i>Sir?</i>

527
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,792
Ready phasers, and lock!

528
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:28,208
Stand by on warp nine.

529
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,583
Heading...

530
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:33,333
7, 7 mark 20.

531
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,750
Engage!

532
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,792
Steady...

533
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:42,041
Now! Reverse and stop!

534
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,166
Phasers fire! Torpedoes away!

535
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,291
Fire...

536
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:59,125
Fire.

537
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:07,583
By comparing the<i> Stargazer's</i> 
main computer log

538
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,583
with Captain Picard's
personal log

539
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:12,000
I found checksum
discrepancies, sir.

540
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:13,375
What does that mean?

541
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:15,542
All information is
time-coded by entry.

542
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:17,750
And the bits, when totaled,
produce an aggregate amount...

543
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:20,500
I don't want a computer
science lesson, Data!

544
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:21,750
Bottom line?

545
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:23,917
One of these two logs is
a forgery, sir.

546
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,583
Correction.

547
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:28,125
The log just found aboard
the<i> Stargazer</i> is a forgery.

548
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,166
As I said.

549
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:31,834
That is one of them,
is it not?

550
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,291
Captain!

551
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,166
You are looking better, sir.

552
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,333
A little sleep,
thanks to the good doctor,

553
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:41,709
works wonders.

554
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,875
What report on the logs?

555
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:46,417
Yes, sir.

556
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,500
Whoever tampered with your
personal log was clever.

557
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:49,834
GEORDI:
But a bit clumsy.

558
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,583
It's definitely
a fabrication, sir.

559
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,500
Number One,

560
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:57,625
I'd like you to take a look
at this brain scan graph...

561
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,000
What are you doing here?

562
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:01,250
I thought I was captain
of this starship.

563
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:02,625
Of course you are,
but I...

564
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:04,000
Thank you for
the confirmation, Doctor.

565
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:05,625
But now, except for Riker,

566
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:08,709
I would like you all
to return to your stations.

567
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,792
Is that clear?

568
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,291
Sir.

569
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,625
You, too, Doctor.

570
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,417
I have business
with the commander.

571
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:21,917
Under protest, sir.

572
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,208
You have orders for me, sir?

573
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,750
Release the<i> Stargazer</i> from
the tractor beam, Number One.

574
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:33,917
Sir?

575
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,166
The tractor beam.

576
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,208
Sir, are you abandoning?

577
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,250
No. But her inertia will carry
the<i> Stargazer</i> along with us.

578
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,417
Or did you sleep
through the academy lecture

579
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:47,375
on the conservation of
tractor beam power?

580
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:48,792
No, sir.

581
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:51,083
I'll release her, of course.

582
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:09,500
BEVERLY:
Obviously there's some sort of
thought-process disorder here.

583
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:12,542
But I can't find
a physical reason for it.

584
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:13,917
Anything?

585
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm puzzled, too.

586
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:20,083
I keep sensing random thoughts,
but two sets of them--

587
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:23,834
as if they were his, but
intermixed with other thoughts

588
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,375
which are also his.

589
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,834
I'm busy at the moment,
Wesley.

590
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,917
I know, Mom,
but this is important.

591
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:33,041
When I went back to the main
sensors in Engineering

592
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:34,917
to try some more sensitivity
experiments...

593
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:37,750
TROI:
Does this have to do
with Captain Picard?

594
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,000
Yes, ma'am.

595
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,000
If this is what
you're talking about here.

596
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:43,667
I don't know much
about brain scans.

597
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:45,959
But I glanced at these
when you were studying them

598
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
and I noticed that
these patterns are the same

599
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:50,750
as those picked up from
the low-intensity transmissions

600
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:52,375
from the Ferengi ship.

601
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,291
I went back and checked.

602
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,291
And they're exactly
the same.

603
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:57,750
What kind of transmissions?

604
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:59,208
I don't know.

605
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,458
Engineering has nothing
like it on record.

606
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,834
Let's get to the captain.

607
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:04,083
No, they might be
affecting the captain.

608
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,667
To Riker.

609
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,041
You're welcome, ladies.

610
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,583
Adults.

611
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,834
The captain, Commander?

612
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,458
Resting in his quarters

613
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,709
after ordering both of you to
return to your duty stations.

614
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,875
TROI:
There have been some...

615
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:29,959
Did he say low-intensity?

616
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,291
Mm.

617
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,875
Some unusual low-intensity
transmissions

618
00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:35,041
from the Ferengi vessel.

619
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,041
Did who say?

620
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,667
My son.

621
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:39,583
Transmissions which exactly
match certain anomalies

622
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:42,208
found in the captain's
brain scans.

623
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:46,709
Something over there is
affecting the captain's
thought patterns.

624
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,917
Computer, give me a location
on Captain Picard.

625
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:54,792
<i>Captain Picard is</i>
<i>in Transporter Room 3.</i>

626
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:56,250
What?

627
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:59,834
Computer, emergency order
to Transporter Room 3.

628
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,458
<i>New information.</i>

629
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,125
<i>Captain Picard is no longer</i>
<i>aboard the</i> Enterprise.

630
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,834
Welcome back,
Captain.

631
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,375
What is happening?

632
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:37,792
Shields up,
computer.

633
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:40,834
What are you doing?

634
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:44,125
Collecting on an old debt.

635
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:50,750
<i>Stargazer!</i>
Captain, respond!

636
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:52,083
Shields up, sir.

637
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,750
No way to beam over any help.

638
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,208
Commander, I'm reading
something very strange here.

639
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,000
A low-intensity beam
of intermittent pulse

640
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,333
inside this starship.

641
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:03,583
I have a fix on it, sir.

642
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,625
Inside Captain Picard's
quarters.

643
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:09,458
You transferred some of his
belongings from the<i> Stargazer?</i>

644
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,750
Yes, including
a fairly heavy chest.

645
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,500
RIKER:
Go take a look, fast!

646
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:16,000
Commander...

647
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:18,125
the<i> Stargazer</i> is now
powering up, sir.

648
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:29,291
I have been waiting a long
nine years for this, Picard.

649
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,792
I don't know what
you're talking about.

650
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:36,625
Do you not, human?

651
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,166
Can you not remember

652
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:44,375
the crime you committed
against my very blood?

653
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:47,583
You murdered my only son!

654
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:49,041
Your son?

655
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:52,208
He was commander of
the ship you destroyed

656
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,125
on his first voyage
as DaiMon.

657
00:35:55,166 --> 00:36:00,417
The ship... the Ferengi
vessel that attacked me.

658
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,291
Or is it about
to attack me?

659
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,500
And I have spent
these years

660
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:11,333
searching, seeking,
a proper blood revenge.

661
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,125
And I found it!

662
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:23,750
I am rich, Picard.

663
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:27,834
Yet two of these
cost me the profits

664
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,667
of an entire life.

665
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:34,166
You are back in command
of the<i> Stargazer,</i> Picard.

666
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:38,041
These computers will
answer your orders.

667
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:43,750
Die well, Captain!

668
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,208
<i>First Officer's log:</i>

669
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,375
<i>Captain Picard has beamed</i>
<i>himself to the</i> Stargazer,

670
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:58,500
<i>which is now moving away from</i>
<i>us under its own power.</i>

671
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:02,333
<i>Enterprise</i> to<i> Stargazer,</i>
please respond!

672
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,875
<i>Enterprise</i> to Captain Picard
aboard<i> Stargazer,</i>

673
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:15,959
please answer!

674
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:22,250
Mr. Data, what was
<i>Stargazer's</i> condition?

675
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:25,166
Considerable fire damage
to interior surfaces
reported, sir.

676
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:27,041
But none of her main
systems are crippled.

677
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,709
Armaments, Lieutenant Yar?

678
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,917
Six photon torpedoes
short, sir.

679
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:33,959
Probably used when the captain
destroyed his Ferengi attackers
9 years ago.

680
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,709
Otherwise, fully armed.

681
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,000
What do you make of it,
La Forge?

682
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:39,750
Seems to be a network of
miniature circuitries, sir,

683
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,375
incredibly complex.

684
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:43,750
Maybe... maybe an amplifier.

685
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:50,166
Where was it in the captain's
quarters, Mr. Worf?

686
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,208
His chest from
the<i> Stargazer,</i> sir?

687
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,834
Just where I had left it,
he hadn't yet unpacked.

688
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,583
So he may not have even
known it was there?

689
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:02,083
And if this can pick up or
magnify thought-altering
transmission--

690
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:05,000
It could have prepared him
for whatever is happening now.

691
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:07,125
Let's find out... or try to.

692
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:10,166
Contact the Ferengi vessel,
Lieutenant.

693
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:11,792
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

694
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,667
<i>Enterprise</i> to Ferengi vessel,

695
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,000
we transmit visually.

696
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:16,375
Do you respond?

697
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:20,792
Why is our gift to you
under power, human?

698
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:22,542
I will discuss that with
your captain.

699
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:25,417
He is working in
our ship's laboratory.

700
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,417
Where is<i> your</i> captain?

701
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:30,000
He's beamed himself aboard
the<i> Stargazer.</i>

702
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,458
And I'm wondering if this has
something to do with it.

703
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:36,792
How do you have
possession of that?

704
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:38,166
It was found in our
captain's chest,

705
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:40,458
which was brought over
from the<i> Stargazer.</i>

706
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,792
It is a forbidden device--

707
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:45,166
a thought maker.

708
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:47,542
If your captain is criminal
enough to own one--

709
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:48,875
Kazago!

710
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:51,750
You know who controls
those spheres.

711
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:53,375
Now I ask you again,

712
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,542
first officer to first officer,

713
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,125
what's going on?

714
00:38:57,166 --> 00:39:02,083
It is not seemly to question
one's own DaiMon, Riker.

715
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:04,959
I am not prepared to do that.

716
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,500
Sir!
I have the<i> Stargazer.</i>

717
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:08,000
Switch, now!

718
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:11,834
<i>Enterprise</i> to Picard.

719
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:14,333
Do not attack again!

720
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,625
We are on a peaceful mission.

721
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,792
Give your identity!

722
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:23,041
You force us
to defend ourselves!

723
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:27,625
Phasers full up!
Arm torpedoes!

724
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,458
Why aren't the shields
at full power?

725
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:35,041
We've lost him, sir.

726
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,542
When he put up
the shields, sir.

727
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:42,417
Damn!

728
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,166
I said get the fusion
generators under surge control.

729
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:46,041
You're moving much to slowly!

730
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,959
Arm the torpedoes, man!

731
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:53,583
Vigo! Get a fire control
party up here!

732
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:57,875
<i>Shields weakening, Captain.</i>

733
00:39:57,917 --> 00:39:59,542
<i>Fusion generator online.</i>

734
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:00,917
Weapons report!

735
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:03,000
<i>Phasers coming</i>
<i>to full charge, sir.</i>

736
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:05,667
<i>Torpedoes armed!</i>

737
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:07,041
Who are they?

738
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:09,000
Identify them!

739
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:11,875
<i>They're turning for a third</i>
<i>pass at us, sir!</i>

740
00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:14,375
<i>We can't take</i>
<i>another hit, Captain!</i>

741
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,542
Sir?

742
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,875
I now feel anger
from our captain.

743
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:23,875
Fury over whatever it is
he is reliving out there.

744
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:26,709
The Battle of Maxia, sir,
that's what it is.

745
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,208
The Picard Maneuver!

746
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,000
What is the defense
against that, Data?

747
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,667
There is no defense, sir.

748
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,291
Then devise one, fast!

749
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:40,959
First Officer Kazago
to human Riker.

750
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,291
Not now, Kazago!

751
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:44,291
We do not wish to become
involved in what has

752
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:47,458
become clearly
a Federation matter.

753
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,375
Fine, fine!

754
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:50,458
<i>Enterprise</i> out!

755
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,750
You should also know
that DaiMon Bok no longer
commands this vessel.

756
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:59,041
His first officer has
confined him for

757
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:03,500
engaging in this
unprofitable adventure.

758
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:06,542
Good luck, First Officer Riker.

759
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:12,667
I have computed
a possibility, Commander.

760
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:15,208
Since even deep space
contains trace gases,

761
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,125
a vessel in the Picard Maneuver
might seem to disappear,

762
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:21,875
but our sensors could locate
any sudden compression
of those gases.

763
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:24,500
And use it as an aiming point
to blow our captain to bits?!

764
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:28,000
This class starship
has enough power to use
our tractor beam on it, sir.

765
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:30,375
Seize it, limit
its field of fire.

766
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:31,458
Right!

767
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,875
Concentrate shields
at that point.

768
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:33,959
Make it so!

769
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,125
I hope you're right, Data.

770
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:38,000
No question of it, sir.

771
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,792
Stand by!

772
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:48,917
Lock on tractor beam!

773
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:54,375
Ready phasers.

774
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:56,208
<i>Captain Picard!</i>
<i>Listen to me.</i>

775
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,291
Vigo, is that you?

776
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,625
<i>It's Commander Riker, sir.</i>

777
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,291
Captain, hear me!

778
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,875
Look around.

779
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:09,375
The Ferengi are using
their thought devices on you.

780
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:10,667
Stand by.

781
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,500
Who is this?

782
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:15,750
It's Riker, sir!

783
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:17,083
Your number one!

784
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:19,542
Look for a silver sphere!

785
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,375
Destroy it with your phaser!

786
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,667
Phaser...

787
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:39,667
Sphere...

788
00:42:42,417 --> 00:42:43,959
Bok, used it.

789
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,208
Destroy it!

790
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,542
Phaser...

791
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,250
Destroy the sphere...

792
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,458
Destroy the sphere.

793
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,250
Are you all right, Captain?

794
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:25,208
<i>Captain?</i>

795
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:29,166
<i>Captain! Are you all right?</i>

796
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,125
<i>Captain, are you all right?!</i>

797
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:36,834
Where am I, Number One?

798
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,834
<i>Aboard the</i> Stargazer,<i> sir.</i>

799
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:43,000
<i>The sphere you destroyed,</i>
<i>it's been controlling your--</i>

800
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,625
Bok!

801
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,000
Where is Bok?!

802
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,917
<i>Removed from command, sir.</i>

803
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,375
<i>And placed under guard for his</i>
<i>act of personal vengeance.</i>

804
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:53,583
<i>Seems there was</i>
<i>no profit in it.</i>

805
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,709
In revenge there never is.

806
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:06,625
Let the dead rest.

807
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:09,917
And the past...

808
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:11,625
remain the past.

809
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:17,959
<i>Enterprise,</i> lock on.

810
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:21,417
Beam me home, Riker.
