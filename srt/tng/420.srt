<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44741.9.</i>

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,583
<i>We have arrived at Tagus Three</i>

3
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,750
<i>where the</i> Enterprise
<i>is to serve as host</i>

4
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:14,959
<i>for the Federation Archeology</i>
<i>Council's annual symposium.</i>

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,625
<i>I look forward to giving</i>
<i>tomorrow's keynote address</i>

6
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:20,959
<i>with great anticipation.</i>

7
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,083
(<i> door chimes</i> )

8
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,208
Come.

9
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:28,333
I thought you'd
like to know

10
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,166
the council members
have beamed aboard

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,125
and been assigned
their quarters.

12
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,417
Excellent.

13
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,709
Captain, it really
is quite late.

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,000
Tell me, Counselor,
with a regard to my lecture,

15
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,625
what do you think will provide
the greater clarity--

16
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,083
a chronological structure,

17
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,709
or the division of each
expedition's findings

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,041
into various
religious sociological

19
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,333
and environmental
subgroupings?

20
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,792
I thought you'd
already decided

21
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:56,417
on a chronological
structure.

22
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,792
There is something
to be said

23
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:01,083
for a more
scientific approach.

24
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,792
May I make
a suggestion?

25
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:04,250
By all means.

26
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,875
Relax.

27
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:08,750
You've written a
brilliant speech.

28
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:11,917
It will need to be.

29
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,375
Tomorrow, I'm gonna
be addressing

30
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:14,959
some of the greatest
scientific minds

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,250
in the Federation.

32
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:20,125
Switzer, Klarc-Tarn-Droth,
McFarland--

33
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,917
giants in the field
of archeology.

34
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,667
Compared to them, I'm just
an enthusiastic amateur.

35
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:27,875
I doubt they see
you as an amateur,

36
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:29,834
not when it comes
to Tagus Three.

37
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,917
Well, it's true.
I have done my homework.

38
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,959
I have examined
the findings

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,750
of every archeological
expedition conducted

40
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,083
on the planet's surface.

41
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,834
It is unfortunate
that the Taguans

42
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,583
no longer allow outsiders
to visit the ruins.

43
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,625
Indeed. Especially
since we know

44
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,375
so little about
their origins.

45
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:50,709
But I think... I think
that I have constructed

46
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,125
some plausible
theories of my own.

47
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,834
And I'm sure the council
members will agree with you.

48
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,417
Your support is
appreciated, Counselor.

49
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,792
Now, good night, Captain.

50
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,500
VASH:
Bring back any memories?

51
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,583
Vash!

52
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,375
How did you get in here?

53
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,625
I came in through the window.

54
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,542
(<i> relic falling</i> )

55
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:47,667
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

56
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,125
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

57
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,750
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

58
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:57,125
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

59
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:01,792
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

60
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:05,917
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

61
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:13,333
I had no idea you were a member
of the Archeology Council.

62
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,458
You are a member...

63
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,792
aren't you?

64
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:21,792
More or less.

65
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,041
Why did you come
to Tagus Three?

66
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,834
To see you, of course.

67
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,667
Is that the
only reason?

68
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,917
Isn't it enough?

69
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,875
I wish I could
believe you.

70
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

71
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,667
I really have missed you,
Jean-Luc.

72
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,083
(<i> door chimes</i> )

73
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,875
Excuse me.

74
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,709
I'm sorry I'm late.

75
00:05:56,792 --> 00:06:00,375
Oh!
Excuse me.

76
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,542
I didn't realize
you had company.

77
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,083
Uh, that's all right.
Allow me to introduce you.

78
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,375
This is Beverly.

79
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,500
Dr. Beverly...
Doctor-- Dr. Beverly Crusher.

80
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,709
This is, um... Vash.

81
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,750
She's a friend of mine from
the Archeology Council.

82
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,917
I didn't mean
to interrupt.

83
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,250
The Captain and I often
share morning tea together.

84
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,458
VASH:
Yes, I know.

85
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,000
Jean-Luc has told me
all about you.

86
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,083
Really?

87
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,667
When was that?

88
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:29,834
On Risa,
where we met.

89
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,542
I see.

90
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,750
Well, that must have been
during your vacation last year.

91
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:37,875
No-- yes.

92
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:39,417
Yes.

93
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,667
BEVERLY:
Well, I am surprised

94
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,458
he didn't mention you.

95
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,166
So am I.

96
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,125
Doctor, are you busy?

97
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,792
Not at the moment.

98
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:56,000
I was wondering,
I would love to see

99
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,667
some more of this
marvelous ship.

100
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,458
I would be delighted
to show it to you.

101
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,166
I, um...

102
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:06,834
That is, if it's all right
with you, Jean-Luc.

103
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,875
Of course.

104
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:23,458
Don't worry.
I promise to behave myself.

105
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,083
And this is Ten Forward,

106
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,291
where the council's welcoming
reception will be held today.

107
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,875
Well, I can't think
of a better location.

108
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,208
Tell me, does Jean-Luc
come here often?

109
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,375
BEVERLY:
Not often.

110
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,667
The Captain is a
very private man.

111
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,333
Would you like
something to drink?

112
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,875
Please.

113
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,834
Eternity never
looked so lovely.

114
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,041
Excuse me?

115
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,083
I was referring
to the view-- eternity.

116
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,000
It never looked so lovely.

117
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,583
You must be Commander Riker.

118
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,041
I'm afraid you have me
at a disadvantage.

119
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,625
I didn't mean to interrupt.

120
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:18,917
I believe you were
about to tell me that...

121
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,291
my eyes are as mysterious
as the stars.

122
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,375
You're a Betazoid.

123
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,291
(<i> chuckles</i> )
Not at all.

124
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,792
It's just that Jean-Luc does
a very good imitation of you.

125
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,542
He does?
Mmm.

126
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,709
I see you two have met.

127
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,750
Not exactly.

128
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:40,166
This is Vash, a member
of the Archeology Council,

129
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,625
and a friend of
the Captain's.

130
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,125
So I gathered.

131
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,792
They met during
his visit to Risa.

132
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:47,291
On Risa?

133
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,709
That vacation must have
been better than he let on.

134
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,917
You mean, he never mentioned me
to you either?

135
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,500
MAN: Dr. Crusher,
please report to Sick Bay.

136
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:59,542
I'm afraid I won't be
able to finish our tour.

137
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,417
But perhaps Commander Riker
could take over for me.

138
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,709
It would be
my pleasure.

139
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,333
This is the Main Bridge,

140
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,500
the command center
of the<i> Enterprise,</i>

141
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,083
and our last stop.

142
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,333
Vash, Commander La Forge.

143
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,709
Vash, hello.
Hello.

144
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,792
Commander Data.

145
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,041
Hello.
How do you do?

146
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,000
And this is
Lieutenant Worf.

147
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,041
Hello.

148
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,792
Something wrong,
Lieutenant?

149
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:23,792
I had not been informed
that council members

150
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,458
had been granted
Bridge clearance.

151
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,875
Well, I think we can make
an exception in this case.

152
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,917
Vash is a guest
of the captain.

153
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:32,709
Welcome aboard.

154
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,542
Thank you.

155
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,750
Is this where
Jean-Luc sits?

156
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,709
RIKER:
That's the big chair.

157
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,375
Mm-hmm.

158
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,291
Well, I can see
where being

159
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,583
a starship captain
has its rewards.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,750
I'm glad that you approve.

161
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,125
I suppose I'll go
back to my room now

162
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,667
and get ready for
the reception.

163
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:12,583
By all means.

164
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:18,083
Well, I suppose I'll
see you then, then.

165
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,083
I look forward to it.

166
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,667
Fascinating woman.

167
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,083
I don't understand.

168
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,792
I thought being
the ship's counselor

169
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:48,083
meant the captain
confided in you.

170
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,041
He does when he
thinks it's necessary.

171
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,291
And he never spoke
to you about me?

172
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,166
Not that I recall.

173
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,750
Not even a hint?

174
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,750
You must understand,
the captain is a very...

175
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,000
private man.
Private man.

176
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,834
I know.

177
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,000
Excuse me.

178
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,375
Of course.

179
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:17,709
Nice legs...

180
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,166
for a human.

181
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,291
But, unfortunately...

182
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,834
Jean-Luc,
we need to talk.

183
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,458
Excuse me.

184
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,291
Well, the reception
seems to be going well.

185
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,417
Forget the reception
for a moment.

186
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,667
Why have you never mentioned
me to your friends?

187
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,750
What would you
have me tell them?

188
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,250
That we met,
for one thing.

189
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,208
That we had an adventure
together, some fun.

190
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,375
It wouldn't be possible.

191
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,500
Why not?

192
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:47,959
It would be, uh...

193
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,458
inappropriate.

194
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,834
I wasn't expecting you to
go into intimate details.

195
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,750
A captain
does not reveal

196
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:57,625
his personal feelings
to his crew.

197
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,000
Is that a Starfleet
regulation,

198
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,125
or did you just
make that up yourself?

199
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,917
I'm sorry
if you're upset.

200
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,500
And I'm sorry if my being
here embarrasses you.

201
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,041
How was the reception?

202
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,542
Splendid.

203
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,166
Jean-Luc, it's wonderful
to see you again.

204
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,083
How about a big hug?

205
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,500
Well don't just stand
there, say something.

206
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:38,667
Get out of my chair!

207
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,667
Aww.
And I was hoping for something

208
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,041
more along the lines of,
"Welcome back, Q.

209
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,166
It's a pleasure to see
you again, my old friend."

210
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,500
We're not friends.

211
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:49,000
You wound me,
<i>mon capitaine.</i>

212
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,208
There.

213
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,834
Perhaps now, your manners
will show some improvement.

214
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,792
What brings you here, Q?

215
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:59,208
Have you been banished by
the Continuum once again?

216
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,875
Oh, hardly.

217
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:03,000
They're still apologizing
to me for the last time.

218
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,458
Then what is it you want?

219
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,291
Do I always have to
have a reason to stop by?

220
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,000
I was merely in the sector.
I was, uh...

221
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,500
(<i> chuckles</i> )
You force a confession from me.

222
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,250
The truth is,
I have a debt to repay.

223
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,208
A debt?
To you.

224
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,500
And it gnaws at me, and it
interferes with each of my days.

225
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:25,083
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

226
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,083
Without your assistance
on our last encounter,

227
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,709
I would never have survived.

228
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,917
I would have taken my own life
but for you.

229
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,792
We all make mistakes.

230
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,959
Your good deed made possible

231
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,917
my reinstatement
in the Continuum,

232
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,208
and I resent
owing you anything.

233
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,208
So, I'm here
to pay up.

234
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,166
Tell me, what is it you wish,
and I'll be gone.

235
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,834
Just be gone.
That'll do nicely.

236
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,542
No, no, no, no, no,
it has to be something

237
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,500
more-- more, uh...
constructive.

238
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:54,000
That's my new
word for the day.

239
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,458
Some other time, Q.

240
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,709
Right now, I have other
matters to attend to.

241
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,792
Yes, your speech.
I read it.

242
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:02,583
It's dull, plodding,
pedantic-- much like yourself.

243
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,709
I could help you
with it.

244
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,333
No, thank you.

245
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,709
You've never actually
been to the ruins

246
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,250
of Tagus Three, have you?

247
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:19,208
No, they were sealed off
more than a century ago.

248
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,667
Well, that explains it then.

249
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,458
How can you write
about something

250
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,166
that you've never seen?

251
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,959
I know.
Why don't I take you there?

252
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,208
Out of the question.

253
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,291
That would mean
breaking Taguan law.

254
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,792
Must you always be so ethical?

255
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:42,041
I suppose we could travel
back in time.

256
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,500
You could see what Tagus
was like two billion years ago.

257
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:49,375
They really knew how to party
back in those days.

258
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:50,875
My answer is still no.

259
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:53,417
My lecture will have
to stand on its own.

260
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,417
And now, will you
please leave my ship?!

261
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,500
You are simply the most
impossible person

262
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:00,291
to buy a gift for.

263
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,750
Commander Riker, will you
report to my ready room?

264
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,750
Yes, Captain?

265
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,417
I've just been paid
a visit from Q.

266
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,542
Q?
Any idea what he's up to?

267
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,792
He wants to do something
nice for me.

268
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,667
I'll alert the crew.

269
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,166
Captain.

270
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,417
(<i> door chimes</i> )

271
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,709
VASH:
Who's there?

272
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,208
It's me.

273
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,792
Who?

274
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,000
Jean-Luc.

275
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,083
Yes?

276
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,333
May I come in?

277
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,083
Let me try to explain.

278
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,917
I... I am by no means

279
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:15,875
embarrassed by
your presence here.

280
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:17,542
On the contrary.

281
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:25,291
What's this--
a map of the ruins?

282
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

283
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:33,709
I thought that I was the only
reason you came to Tagus.

284
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,500
I never fooled
you for a second.

285
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:42,166
Still, you are the most
important reason.

286
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,750
Am I?

287
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,667
That's the problem with being
such a well-known liar--

288
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:51,583
even when I'm telling the
truth, no one believes me.

289
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,792
This equipment will have
to be confiscated.

290
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:12,208
Is that necessary?

291
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,458
If the Taguans were to
catch you down there...

292
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,375
Oh, come on.

293
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,625
You gave me the same warning
about Sarathong Five.

294
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,959
I remember.

295
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,500
Well, it didn't stop me
from going there.

296
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,750
I brought back some very
impressive artifacts too.

297
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:30,583
Which no doubt you sold
for a very impressive profit.

298
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,125
That's what I do.

299
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,291
Not on board my ship.
I will not allow it.

300
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,083
Let's get one thing
straight though, Picard.

301
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,041
I cannot change who I am
for you or anyone else.

302
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,375
Nor can I change who I am.

303
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:47,250
Then we have nothing more
to say to one another.

304
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,583
So it would seem.

305
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,083
(<i> door closes</i> )

306
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,000
Sleeping alone?

307
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,375
I'm in no mood for
your foolishness, Q.

308
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,291
I knew there was something
different about you.

309
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:28,333
You seemed tense, preoccupied.
Somewhat... smaller.

310
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,291
At first, I thought it was
that horrible lecture of yours.

311
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,709
But I was mistaken.

312
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,500
Whatever game it is
you want to play,

313
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:36,000
it will have to
wait until tomorrow.

314
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,333
I had such high hopes
for you, Picard.

315
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,834
I thought you were
a bit more evolved

316
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,417
than the rest
of your species.

317
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,667
But now, I realize you're just
as weak as all the others.

318
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,250
Still, it pains me to see
the great Jean-Luc Picard

319
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,125
brought down by a woman.

320
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,500
What woman?

321
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:55,750
(<i> chuckles</i> )

322
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:58,333
Don't play coy
with me, Captain.

323
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,959
I witnessed your little
spat with Vash.

324
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,875
Nor will I soon forget
the look of anguish

325
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:07,041
on your face--
the pain, the misery.

326
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,792
If I didn't know better,

327
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:12,333
I would have thought
you were already married.

328
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,041
You must be very bored, Q.

329
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,959
Your imagination is
running away with you.

330
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
This human emotion--
love--

331
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,000
it's a dangerous
thing, Picard.

332
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,583
And obviously, you're
ill-equipped to handle it.

333
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,291
She's found a
vulnerability in you.

334
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,834
A vulnerability I've been
looking for for years.

335
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,417
If I had known sooner,

336
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,667
I would have appeared
as a female.

337
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,417
Mark my words, Picard.

338
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,417
This is your
Achilles' heel.

339
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,750
Believe what you wish.

340
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:47,041
Do you deny that you
care for this woman?

341
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,208
Believe me, I'd be
doing you a big favor

342
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,542
if I turned her into
a Klabnian eel.

343
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,208
Stay away from her, Q.

344
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,792
I was just trying to help.

345
00:19:57,834 --> 00:20:01,208
My debt to you--
Is hereby nullified.

346
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,125
I don't want your help,
your advice, your favors,

347
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,917
or, for that matter,<i> you.</i>

348
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,959
Do you understand
once and for all?

349
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,166
You would have me
stand idly by

350
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,917
as she led you to
your destruction?

351
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,250
Yes!

352
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,583
As you wish.

353
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,875
(<i> audience members</i>
<i>talking quietly</i> )

354
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:36,834
Ladies and gentlemen,

355
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,250
members of the
Archeology Council, welcome.

356
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,000
Mystery.

357
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,875
It is the mystery
of Tagus Three

358
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:49,375
that brings us
here together today.

359
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:51,166
It is a mystery
that has invited

360
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:56,333
more argument, more deduction,
more speculation

361
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,583
than the best
works of fiction.

362
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,375
And if you will excuse
the conceit,

363
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:06,208
I want to tell you
about<i> my</i> detective story.

364
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,542
For several years now,
I have been trying

365
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,041
to unravel the secrets
of Tagus Three.

366
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,834
Needless to say,
I have not succeeded.

367
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,667
However, I have,
I believe,

368
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,667
turned up some
new information

369
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,125
that, if nothing else,

370
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,959
only raises a new set
of mysteries, and I hope

371
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,041
that we can discuss
them here together.

372
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:28,583
There have been 947 known
archeological excavations

373
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,250
conducted on the planet surface.

374
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,333
Of those, some 74

375
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,333
are generally believed
to have revealed

376
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,625
findings of
major importance.

377
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:40,083
The earliest were some
22,000 years ago...

378
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,000
(<i> audience murmuring</i> )

379
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,959
What the hell?

380
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,500
(<i> sighs</i> )

381
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,208
Q!

382
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,125
Is this Tagus Three?

383
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,583
I doubt there are many
oak trees on Tagus.

384
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:16,542
No, I think this is
supposed to be Earth,

385
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:20,667
somewhere around about
the 12th century.

386
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:23,792
And this is England-- or to be
more precise, Sherwood Forest.

387
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,834
At least Q's
re-creation of it.

388
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,000
That would explain
these costumes.

389
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,667
Quite right, Number One.

390
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:32,208
Or should I say,
John Little.

391
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,458
BEVERLY:
Well, if he's Little John,

392
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,125
that makes you--
PICARD: I know.

393
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,041
Robin Hood.

394
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,625
Sir, I protest.

395
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,917
I am not a merry man!

396
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,834
On the contrary,
Lieutenant Worf.

397
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,333
Your clothing
identifies you

398
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,333
with the character
of Will Scarlett.

399
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,750
Just as Geordi's mandolin
identifies him as Alan-a-Dale.

400
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:52,417
And you, Mr. Data,
bear a striking resemblance

401
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,333
to Friar Tuck.

402
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,792
I will not play the fool
for Q's amusement!

(<i> hoofbeats,</i>

404
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:11,583
I have you at last,

Quick, into the forest!

Mr. Worf!
That's an order!

408
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,083
SIR GUY:
Enough, you fools!

409
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,500
We'll never find them
in the greenwood.

Q.

417
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:22,875
It's about time you showed up.

418
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:25,542
I would prefer if you
addressed me as His Honor,

419
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,417
the High Sheriff
of Nottingham.

420
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,667
We will no longer share in this
pointless fantasy of yours.

421
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:33,041
Fine--
stay here and do nothing.

422
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,667
By mid-day tomorrow,

423
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:36,959
your crew will be
safely aboard their ship.

424
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,917
Of course, you will have to
accept the consequences

425
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,291
of your inaction.

426
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,959
Consequences?

427
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,834
What is the
one thing

428
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,834
that Robin Hood
is most famous for?

429
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:49,083
He robs from the rich
and gives to the poor.

430
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:52,083
Besides that.

431
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,083
Perhaps you are
referring to the rescue

432
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,875
of Maid Marion from
Nottingham Castle.

433
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:57,458
Q:
Yes, Data!

434
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,375
And it just so happens
that Sir Guy of Gisbourne

435
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:05,375
has decreed that Marion's head
shall come off tomorrow at noon.

436
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,792
Vash.

437
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,667
It's your choice,
Robin.

438
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:14,667
You can either take your ease
in this sylvan glade

439
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:17,583
or risk your life to save the
woman you care nothing about.

440
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,208
My feelings towards Vash
are irrelevant.

441
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,417
I would attempt to save any
innocent life, as you well know.

442
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,875
Yes, but what about
your merry men?

443
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:28,333
Are you willing to jeopardize
their lives as well?

444
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,667
Is Vash's life

445
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:32,500
worth more than
Data's or Troi's,

446
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:34,083
or Worf's?

447
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,375
You know, Worf, you'd make
a perfect throw rug

448
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:37,583
in Nottingham Castle.

PICARD: Q, I ask you

450
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,291
to put an end to this
before someone gets hurt.

451
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,917
Oh, that's impossible.

452
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,041
You see, I've given this

453
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,750
a life of its own.
I have no more idea

what's going to
happen than you do.

455
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:53,875
But of one thing,
I'm absolutely sure.

456
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:56,959
If you dare come to
Nottingham Castle,

457
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,083
blood will be spilled.

458
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:16,166
Oh, you'll wear yourself out
with all that pacing, m'lady.

459
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,667
I told you to stop
calling me that.

460
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,834
The name is Vash.

461
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,250
Oh.
My poor lamb.

You've got a brain
sickness, for sure.

Oh, can't I get you something
to ease your suffering?

I could use a drink.

Well, I wasn't thinking
of spirits, m'lady,

466

but I have some
nice fresh leeches...

Then the execution will
proceed as scheduled.

What execution?

00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,667
I warn you, Marian,

this pathetic attempt
at feigning madness

00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,417
knows you're still
in love with him.

534
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:50,583
VASH:
That's a lie!

535
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:52,333
He-- he bewitched me.

536
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,041
He put me under
some evil spell.

537
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:56,875
I suspected as much.

538
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:58,375
You can add sorcery
to the list

539
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:00,166
of charges
against that rogue.

540
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:03,041
Sir Guy, if anyone's been
bewitched here, it's you.

541
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,375
Silence!

542
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:05,875
Any more impudence,
and it'll be your head

543
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:08,959
on the block.

544
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,375
Guard.

545
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:14,834
Escort the Lady Marian
to her chamber.

546
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,125
But I'd much rather
stay here with you.

547
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,875
Of course you would,
my child,

548
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:22,625
but I have important
business to attend to.

549
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:34,041
Lovely creature.

550
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,083
Intriguing.

551
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:38,625
(<i> chuckles</i> )

552
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:47,959
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

553
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:04,875
(<i> noise outside</i> )

554
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,834
One step closer, I'll scream.

555
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,667
(<i> grunting</i> )

556
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,291
Vash, damn it, it's me.

557
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:18,834
Jean-Luc!

558
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,625
Am I glad to see you--
you wouldn't believe

559
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:21,959
what I've been
going through!

560
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,542
One minute,
I'm on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

561
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:24,959
The next thing I know,
I'm here in Nottingham.

562
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,834
First, they're gonna
chop my head off.

563
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:29,375
Now, I'm supposed to
marry someone named Sir Guy,

564
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:32,750
and everyone insists
on calling me Marian.

565
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:34,041
Yes, I know.

566
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,125
You do?
But how?

567
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,625
You're Robin Hood.

568
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,291
My staff and I
were brought here

569
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,375
by an old adversary
of mine named Q.

570
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:45,959
But I'll tell you the rest
of that when we're safe.

571
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,542
Come on, we don't
have much time.

572
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,000
And the others
are outside?

573
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:50,542
They're waiting for us
back at Sherwood Forest.

574
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,208
You mean, you came
here alone?

575
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,083
That's right-- now, come on!
What kind of plan is that?

576
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,625
It's an excellent one--
if you'll just hurry up!

577
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,458
Do you realize our lives
are at stake here?

578
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,041
Only too well.

579
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,792
And this is the best strategy
you could come up with?

580
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:02,458
One man against
an entire castle?

581
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,625
You have a better one?

582
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:06,792
How about this?
You go, I'll stay here.

583
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:08,959
And do what?

584
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,875
Marry Sir Guy
if I have to.

585
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,542
Oh, that's brilliant.

586
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:16,208
If there's a way to escape,
I'll find it... eventually,

587
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,291
with my head still attached.

588
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,417
You really believe
I would leave you here?

589
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,125
I can take care
of myself.

590
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,041
You are the most stubborn
woman I ever knew.

591
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,625
Hey!

592
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:29,792
There'll be no escape for
you this time, Robin Hood.

593
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,542
You stay behind me.

594
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,166
You should have left
while you had the chance.

595
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:42,125
Well done, my dear.

596
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:45,125
Consider it my wedding gift
to you, darling.

597
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,917
Congratulations, Sir Guy.

598
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:19,250
I see you snared
the jackal.

599
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,917
It's Marian who
deserves the credit.

600
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:25,333
Took him with
his own sword.

601
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:37,500
You sent for me,
m'lady?

602
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,500
I want you to take this
letter to Robin's men.

603
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:43,291
You want<i> me</i> to go
to Sherwood Forest

604
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,500
at this time
of night?

605
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:45,792
You'll leave immediately.

606
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,583
But it's dark.
I'll get lost.

607
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,792
Besides, it's not safe,
what with all them

608
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:54,041
hedge robbers
and worse lurking about.

609
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,834
Please, this is urgent.

610
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:59,000
If you ask me, you'd be
better off with Sir Guy.

611
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,750
He's got a future.

612
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,917
Why, you'll be living in
London before you know it.

613
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:05,333
But you must go.
Otherwise, they'll kill him.

614
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,166
(<i> snaps</i> )
Out.

615
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,417
How dare you barge
in here like this?

616
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,709
I've come to apologize
for my harsh words.

617
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,458
I had no idea that
you were so ruthless.

618
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,542
That's most gracious of you.

619
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,750
I admit I was surprised,

620
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:22,083
but no more surprised
than Jean-Luc.

621
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,125
You're Q.

622
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:29,875
Yes, and you are a very
interesting woman.

623
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,417
What is this?

624
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,667
Give that to me.

625
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:36,667
A letter to Riker.

626
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:39,792
"Quick, come to
the castle.

627
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:41,291
Save the captain."

628
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,291
Why, this is wonderful!

629
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,583
What marvelous
duplicity.

630
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:48,750
You certainly fooled
Sir Guy, and me, as well.

631
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:50,542
I think you're worth
further study.

632
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,166
Am I?

633
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:56,000
Yes, but unfortunately,
we just don't have the time.

634
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,709
Guards!

635
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,792
Take this traitor away.

636
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:07,375
It appears there's going
to be a double execution.

637
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,041
VASH: This whole thing
is your fault.

638
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,417
PICARD:
My fault?

639
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:39,792
Yes, your fault.

640
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,291
If you hadn't
grabbed my sword,

641
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,875
we'd be back in
Sherwood by now.

642
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:45,333
I grabbed your sword

643
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:46,959
to prevent you
from being killed.

644
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,417
Oh, really?

645
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,500
Not as a wedding
present for Sir Guy?

646
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,834
You know I had no intention
of going through with that.

647
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,375
Do I?

648
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:56,083
You should never
have interfered.

649
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,542
You're the one
interfering.

650
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:58,959
I was just trying
to rescue you.

651
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,583
Well, next time,
don't bother.

652
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,166
Don't you worry, I won't.

653
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:04,166
Q: Don't the two of you
ever stop arguing?

654
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,542
Now tell me, Robin.

655
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:07,166
As you stand here
facing the termination

656
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,208
of your insect existence,

657
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,208
do you see what
brought you to this end?

658
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,542
Was she worth it?

659
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,500
Can we just get
this over with?

660
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:16,709
Are you implying
that I'm not worth it?

661
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,166
(<i> scoffs</i> )

662
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,792
Q, your game was
for my benefit.

663
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:23,750
She is innocent
in all of this.

664
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:26,542
Q: Ha! She is many things,
none of them innocent.

665
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:27,792
PICARD:
Let her go!

666
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:29,375
VASH:
Jean-Luc, you do care.

667
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:32,125
Q: A gallant gesture,
Robin, but a futile one.

668
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:36,291
Farewell. I hope the two
of you are happy together.

669
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:37,917
You have been
found guilty

670
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:40,417
of outlawry
and high treason.

671
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,166
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

672
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:46,458
I...

673
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,333
Prepare them for the block.

674
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,083
(<i> crowd chattering</i> )

675
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,834
There are
too many of 'em.

676
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:59,291
Data, we need a
diversion, now.

677
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:33,291
Guards, take Marian
to the tower!

678
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,959
Come on.

679
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:52,083
I'll have you know,
I'm the greatest swordsman

680
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,291
in all of Nottingham.

681
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:59,041
(<i> shouting</i> )

682
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,834
Very impressive.

683
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:39,667
There's something
you should know.

684
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:47,583
And what would that be?

685
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:50,041
I'm not from Nottingham.

686
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:06,417
(<i> approaching footsteps</i> )

687
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:10,166
Jean-Luc.

688
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,917
Oh...

689
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:20,583
It's over, Q!

690
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:21,917
Get us out of here!

691
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:24,500
(<i> sword hitting ground,</i>
<i>Q clapping</i> )

692
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:28,208
My compliments, Picard.

693
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,333
I doubt Robin Hood himself
could have done much better.

694
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:34,166
If you have hurt
any of my people...

695
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:36,125
Q: Sadly enough,
they're all fine.

696
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,750
But my point is they
could have been killed,

697
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:39,375
and so might have you.

698
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:42,166
All for the love of a maid.

699
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:45,041
My debt to you,
Picard, is paid,

700
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:48,000
if you've learned how weak and
vulnerable you really are.

701
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:51,375
If you finally see how love has
brought out the worst in you.

702
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:53,125
Nonsense.
You're absolutely wrong.

703
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:55,500
It's brought out the
best in him--

704
00:40:55,542 --> 00:41:00,250
his nobility, courage,
self-sacrifice...

705
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,333
tenderness.

706
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,834
Q:
Oh, you're good.

707
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:06,000
You're really good.

708
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,959
Enough of this.

709
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,709
Ah... indeed.

710
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:17,458
Is everyone here?

711
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,291
Where's Vash?

712
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,792
Computer,
locate Council Member Vash.

713
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:25,375
COMPUTER: Council member Vash
is not aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

714
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,208
Hello, Jean-Luc.

715
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

716
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,500
Well, this is a relief.

717
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,208
I thought that
perhaps Q had--

718
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,083
Well, he had some things
to discuss with me.

719
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:56,458
Indeed.

720
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:02,291
I'm surprised he's not busy
gloating over his victory.

721
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,125
He was right about
one thing, you know.

722
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:06,542
As ridiculous as it was,

723
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:09,291
his game did prove
that you still care.

724
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:16,583
I may not show my
feelings to my crew,

725
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:19,125
but I do have them.

726
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:24,291
I'm gonna miss you,
Jean-Luc.

727
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:28,625
So, where are you
off to now?

728
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,667
I haven't made up my mind.

729
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:36,125
After all, she has the entire
universe to choose from.

730
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:37,834
Meet my new partner.

731
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:39,917
Him?
Why not?

732
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:42,291
I'll tell you
why not.

733
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:44,500
Now, Jean-Luc,
let's not be unkind.

734
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:47,750
He's devious, and amoral,
and unreliable,

735
00:42:47,792 --> 00:42:50,375
and irresponsible,
and...

736
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:54,208
and definitely
not to be trusted.

737
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,250
Remind you of someone you know?

738
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,208
As matter of fact, it does.

739
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:04,000
We're going to have fun.

740
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:07,667
I'm going to take her places
no human has ever seen.

741
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:10,500
Now, who can resist
an offer like that?

742
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:16,083
As payment in full
of your debt to me,

743
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,000
you will guarantee her safety.

744
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:19,750
She will not be
harmed, Jean-Luc.

745
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,166
I promise you that.

746
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:24,667
Well, are you going
to kiss her good-bye?

747
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:31,959
All right.

748
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:43,041
Well, aren't you?

749
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,417
Oh, I-- I'm sorry, I...

750
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:52,041
I forgot my hat.

751
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,333
Good-bye, Jean-Luc.
