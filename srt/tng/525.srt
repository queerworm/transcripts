00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:05,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45944.1.</i>

2
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:09,417
<i>Following a magnetic wave</i>
<i>survey of the Parvenium system</i>

3
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:10,875
<i>we have detected an object</i>

4
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:13,834
<i>which we cannot</i>
<i>immediately identify.</i>

5
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:18,291
Magnify.

6
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,500
Mr. Data?

7
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:23,500
It appears to be
a probe of some kind,

8
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:26,000
but there is no
starfleet record of
this shape or design.

9
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,458
Is it scanning us?

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,625
No, sir, but it has assumed
a relative position

11
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,583
and is holding
course with us.

12
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:35,166
The probe is composed of
paricium and talgonite--
a ceramic alloy.

13
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,500
Not a very
sophisticated technology.

14
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:42,625
Sir, I am detecting
a low-level nucleonic beam
coming from the probe.

15
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,583
Shields up.
Stand by phasers.

16
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:48,375
The beam is scanning
the shield's perimeter.

17
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:51,000
The probe is emitting
an unusual particle stream.

18
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,041
Sir, the beam is
penetrating our shields.

19
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,250
Increase speed to...

20
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,750
Captain?

21
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,375
It's all right.

22
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:02,917
Captain, I've got you.

23
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,625
It's all...

24
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,792
Well, finally.

25
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,041
How are you feeling?

26
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,625
Kamin?

27
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,625
Can you answer me?

28
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:23,250
What is this place?

29
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,500
Oh, you're still feverish.

30
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:28,458
Computer, freeze program.

31
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,041
Computer, end program.

32
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,041
Kamin...

33
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,959
Picard to<i> Enterprise...</i>

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,375
Kamin,
please don't get up yet.

35
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:44,625
You're still not well.

36
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:48,875
I asked you,
what is this place?

37
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:54,709
This is your home,
of course.

38
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:28,458
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,709
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

40
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,875
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

41
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:38,125
<i>to explore strange new worlds,</i>

42
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:42,667
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

43
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,709
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

44
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:57,750
Am I a prisoner here?

45
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:00,959
Please, dear, you've had
a high fever for three days.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,792
You mustn't push yourself
too quickly.

47
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,709
Kamin...

48
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,375
you really shouldn't
go outside.

49
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,166
Kamin...

50
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,917
please come back inside.

51
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:24,125
(<i> applause</i> )

52
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,041
Thank you.

53
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,500
This sapling is planted

54
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:34,250
as an affirmation of life
in defiance of the drought.

55
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,875
And with expectations
of long life.

56
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:40,625
Whatever comes,

57
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:45,709
we will keep it alive as
a symbol of our survival.

58
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,917
Kamin, you're
back on your feet.

59
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,083
How do you feel, my friend?

60
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,542
Are you in charge here?

61
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,917
In charge?

62
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,875
I want to be returned
to my ship immediately.

63
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:01,750
What ship is that?

64
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,458
Please...

65
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:09,125
Just tell me,
what is this place?

66
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,709
Where am I?

67
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,500
The fever.

68
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,542
It's taken your memory.

69
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,291
That must be it.

70
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,542
Perhaps you can help me.

71
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,625
Anything, my friend.

72
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,250
My name is Kamin.
Yes.

73
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,709
And you are...?

74
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,583
Batai.

75
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,500
Council leader Batai.

76
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,375
Ah...

77
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,750
Batai.

78
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,291
You say I've been ill?

79
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,250
For more than a week.

80
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,458
Eline should have
put you in the hospital

81
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,792
but she insisted
on caring for you herself.

82
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,458
Eline?

83
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,250
Your wife.

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,792
If you don't remember
that, maybe it's
safer not to go home.

85
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:02,375
And, uh...

86
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,125
what is this place?

87
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,959
Perhaps you should
see the doctor.
No.

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,417
Please... I'm sure it
will all come back to me.

89
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:16,709
This is the community
of Ressik,

90
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,083
northern province.

91
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,041
What planet?

92
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,625
Let me take you
back home.
No, really,
I'm quite all right.

93
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,875
Just answer me:
what planet?

94
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:30,875
This is the planet Kataan.

95
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,208
Kataan...

96
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,417
not a Federation planet.

97
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,875
I, uh, think I'll...

98
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:42,542
I'll just take a walk.

99
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:46,458
But you've been ill
for a week.

100
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,875
The exercise
will do me good.

101
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:54,291
I'll, uh, try to
reacquaint myself
with the surroundings.

102
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,458
(<i> knocking at the door</i> )

103
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:40,291
Thank goodness.

104
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,166
I've had people out, trying
to find you everywhere.

105
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,625
Why did you worry us
like that?

106
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,083
Are you hungry?

107
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:02,291
Hungry, thirsty,
exhausted.

108
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:11,458
I suppose that proves
this is not a dream...

109
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,291
doesn't it?

110
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:18,667
You think that this--
your life-- is a dream?

111
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,709
This is not my life.

112
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,542
I know that much.

113
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,166
I've kept something
hot for you.

114
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,250
Where did you go?

115
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:41,333
I walked... for hours.

116
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,208
And you,
just out of bed.

117
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,083
This is delicious.

118
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:10,000
You always say that.

119
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,250
Would you try to answer
some questions for me,

120
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,208
no matter how strange
they may seem to you?

121
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,291
Of course.

122
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,291
Are there any other planets
in this star system?

123
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,834
Do you visit other systems?

124
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,041
All right.

125
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,709
Um... do you have
a communication system here?

126
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,125
How do you...

127
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,166
how do you send messages
to other communities--

128
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,500
other places?

129
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:40,583
The usual way-- by
voice transit conductor.

130
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,542
Do you want to
send a message?

131
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,417
Mm-hmm, yes.

132
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,834
Um, when can that
be arranged?

133
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,250
Tomorrow.

134
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,500
Don't you want
to ask about us?

135
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:59,125
Of course.

136
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:03,250
Um... anything you can
tell me will be helpful.

137
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,750
We, um...

138
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,458
we, um...

139
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,583
we're married.

140
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:15,417
Three years ago.

141
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:19,542
The happiest day of my life
was the day we got married.

142
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:28,333
And what do I do
here in Ressik?

143
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,542
You're the best iron weaver
in the community--

144
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,750
at least I think so.

145
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:35,083
You prefer playing
the flute, of course.

146
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,250
The flute?

147
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,375
Yes.

148
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,166
When did I learn
to play this?

149
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,125
I'm afraid
you never did, dear.

150
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,458
You do keep trying.

151
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,959
I see what you mean.

152
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:12,542
Well, thank you
for the soup.

153
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,041
And thank you
for your help.

154
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,709
Tomorrow, will you help
me to send a message?

155
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,375
Of course.

156
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,166
Now, will you
come to bed?

157
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,458
Oh, I'll sleep here.

158
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,000
Kamin, please come
with me.

159
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,333
I've been sick.

160
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,542
I'll be tossing
and turning.

161
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,625
It wouldn't be
fair to you.

162
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:37,750
Let me be the judge
of that.

163
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,458
Where did you get this?

164
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,667
Kamin, this is the first
gift you ever gave me.

165
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:59,083
Riker to sick bay.
The captain's hurt.

166
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:12,083
Pulse and blood pressure
are normal.

167
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,208
I'm getting hyperactive
fibrogenic activity.

168
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,834
This is odd.
What is it?

169
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,750
There's no evidence
of any injury or trauma.

170
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:25,166
Vital signs are normal but
neurotransmitter production
is off the scale.

171
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,333
What's going on?

172
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,041
This probe is doing
something to him.

173
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,291
Anything yet, Data?

174
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,542
No, sir.

175
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,583
The particle
emission is most unusual.

176
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,667
I am unable to block it.

177
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,458
We should destroy the probe.
Phasers are armed and ready.

178
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,959
I don't think that's wise--
not until we know<i> exactly</i> 
what it's doing to him.

179
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,875
Agreed. Stand down
phasers, Mr. Worf.

180
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:48,667
In the meantime, take us
out of range, Ensign.

181
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:51,333
Thrusters only, 100 kph.
Nice and easy.

182
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,709
Aye, sir.
Data?

183
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,750
The probe is moving
with us, sir, holding
relative position.

184
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:02,375
It's connected itself
to him like a tether.

185
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:12,291
You've been dreaming
about that starship of
yours again, haven't you?

186
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:17,333
I'm just charting
the progress of the
course of the sun.

187
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,875
Might give a clue to the
cause of this drought.

188
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:28,750
I think you're still trying
to figure out where you are,

189
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:32,375
where that ship of yours is,

190
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,959
how to get back
to that life.

191
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:42,458
The memory
is five years old now...

192
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,709
but it's still inside me.

193
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,792
Was your life there so
much better than this?

194
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:54,000
So much more gratifying?

195
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:59,041
So much more fulfilling
that you cling to it
with such stubbornness?

196
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:03,709
Eline...
It must have been
extraordinary,

197
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,458
but never, in all the
stories you've told me,

198
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,709
have you mentioned anyone
who loved you as I do.

199
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

200
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,834
It was real.

201
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,041
It was
as real as this is.

202
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,291
And you can't expect me

203
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:30,417
to forget a lifetime
spent there.

204
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,709
Yes, I can.

205
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,959
I've been patient, Kamin.

206
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,458
For five years,
I've shared you
with that other life.

207
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,959
I've listened,

208
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,166
I've tried to understand,

209
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,166
and I have waited.

210
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,000
When do I get you back?

211
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:54,542
I know.
I know.

212
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,417
It has been hard
on you.

213
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,250
When will you let go?

214
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,083
When will you start
living this life?

215
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,417
When will we start
a family?

216
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:07,583
BATAI:
Kamin.

217
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,375
Eline.
Good morning.

218
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:11,875
Good morning,
Batai.

219
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,041
Are you ready?

220
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,250
The administrator's
already arrived.

221
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,333
Yes.
Will you come along?

222
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,583
No, thank you.

223
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,417
You do very well
on your own.

224
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:30,750
She always was
strong-minded,
even as a child.

225
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,792
It's not her fault.

226
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:36,417
These past few years
have been very
difficult for her.

227
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,375
And for you, I think.

228
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,750
There you are, Batai.
Perhaps you can
explain to me,

229
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:58,041
when crops are dying
all over, how this tree
is flourishing.

230
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:02,500
This tree is our symbol,
our affirmation of life.

231
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:07,208
Everyone in this town gives
part of their water rations
to keep it alive.

232
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,125
We've learned,
Administrator,

233
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:14,166
that hope is a powerful
weapon against anything,
even drought.

234
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,166
A good point.

235
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,875
Perhaps I shall recommend
a symbolic tree in each
of my communities.

236
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:22,500
Now, what business
do we have today?

237
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,875
We need help if we're
to increase the water supply.

238
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:29,542
We think there are ways
to reclaim some of our water.

239
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,291
Batai, you're being
a bit of an alarmist.

240
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:36,917
True, we are in a drought,
but water rationing has
produced a sizeable savings.

241
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,542
If the weather pattern
doesn't change,

242
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,375
rationing will not be enough--
we'll run out of water.

243
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:42,750
Who is this?

244
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,125
Kamin, sir.

245
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,083
Kamin.

246
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,667
Do I know you?

247
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:54,375
No. I haven't spoken
to you before.

248
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:57,625
Well, Kamin, I'm open to
all the people of this town.

249
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,041
I'm delighted to hear
what you have to say.

250
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:06,333
I suggest that we build
atmospheric condensers

251
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,709
which could extract
water from the air.

252
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,166
I don't mean to quash
your very creative ideas,

253
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,583
but building
atmospheric condensers

254
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,250
would be
a monumental undertaking.

255
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,625
We could not hope
to sustain such a project.

256
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,875
Each community will be
responsible for its own.

257
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:23,417
Condensers could
make the difference

258
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,208
between watering our crops
and watching them die.

259
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,875
Well, I'll be glad
to pass along your idea.

260
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:34,083
You'll see that this kind
of participatory government
works for everyone.

261
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:38,667
Be well, Batai. I shall
see you next month.

262
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:42,000
Good to meet you...
Kamin.

263
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,291
BATAI:
Go carefully,
Administrator.

264
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,000
That went very well.

265
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,875
I think he was
impressed with you.

266
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,709
There will be no
atmospheric condensers.

267
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,875
Well, these things take
time, but it will happen.

268
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:01,542
I'm sure of it.

269
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,834
Come and have supper
tonight, old friend.

270
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,709
I'll make
some vegetable stew.

271
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,959
Let's talk about building
our own condenser, hmm?

272
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,667
Kamin...

273
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:16,542
hearing you talk
to the administrator,

274
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:20,041
I realized that
for the first time in years

275
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:25,041
you were speaking
as though you were truly
a member of the community.

276
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,625
It was good to
hear that again.

277
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:38,083
(<i> flute playing</i> )

278
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:53,959
You've been brooding
behind that flute all evening.

279
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:59,834
I'm not brooding.
I'm immersed in my music.

280
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,458
Music.

281
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,917
I find that it helps me
to think.

282
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:11,291
But the real surprise is--
I enjoy it so much.

283
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,333
No, the real surprise
is that you may actually
be improving.

284
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:18,959
Batai.

285
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,792
Yes, ma'am.

286
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,417
Go home.

287
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,583
Yes, ma'am.

288
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,083
Good night, Kamin.

289
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,667
Good night, my friend.

290
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:36,542
Go carefully, Batai.

291
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,542
Don't forget these.

292
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,291
I won't put them away
for you again.

293
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,250
Yes, ma'am.

294
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,000
I've done nothing
but nag all day.

295
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,792
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:01,458
No, I'm the one
who's sorry.

297
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,667
Everything you said
this morning was
absolutely correct.

298
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:11,083
I feel that I have
given you so little

299
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,500
and you have given me
so much.

300
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:17,250
No.

301
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:21,166
You're a good man,
a wonderful husband.

302
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,208
I didn't mean...

303
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,875
No, not such
a wonderful husband.

304
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,500
I spend my spare time
charting the stars,

305
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:32,542
disappear for days at a time
exploring the countryside.

306
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,125
My life is very much
as it was.

307
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,834
Old habits.

308
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,625
You're gentle and kind.

309
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,375
You never once
raised your voice to me.

310
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:48,834
I'd like to ask
your permission
to build something.

311
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,917
Kamin, you've built
your telescope,
your laboratory.

312
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:55,208
You don't need
my permission
for something new.

313
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,375
In this case,
I think I do.

314
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,041
What is it?

315
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:04,291
A nursery.

316
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,375
Really?

317
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,166
Really?

318
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:20,458
Unless, of course, if
you would prefer a porch,

319
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,917
it would certainly
be much easier to build

320
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,542
and I could make
a start on it right away.

321
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,166
No, no.

322
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,125
Geordi, any progress
identifying the probe?

323
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,667
Maybe. I picked up
some residue on
the probe's shell.

324
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,125
I think it came from
the propulsion system.

325
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,917
Looks like they used
a solid propellant as fuel.

326
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,417
Solid propellant?

327
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,542
Sensors read this stuff
as crystalline emiristol--

328
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,792
produces a radioactive trail
that ought to be traceable.

329
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:02,250
Well then, we should
be able to send out
a probe of our own

330
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,458
to trace it back
to the origin.

331
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,834
I'll get right on it.
Commander,

332
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,625
I've been analyzing
the nucleonic beam.

333
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:09,875
I believe it would be possible
to reflect the particles

334
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:13,250
back toward the probe
in a way that would
disrupt the signal.

335
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,834
Doctor?

336
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:17,208
I simply don't know
the risk of shutting
down the beam.

337
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,792
I'm not willing to
let this thing keep
drilling into him.

338
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:22,333
If somebody gets stabbed,
you don't necessarily

339
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,333
pull the knife out
right away.

340
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,000
It might do more harm
than leaving it there.

341
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,208
The captain
is under attack.

342
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,500
We must act.

343
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:30,834
I'm inclined to agree.

344
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,417
Doctor,
monitor him closely.

345
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:36,500
Mr. Data, prepare
to disrupt the beam.

346
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:39,458
We're going to try
to cut this cord.

00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:57,083
And he's starting out
in the warmth of friends.

356
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,625
Thank you.

357
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:01,041
Please, help yourselves
to something to eat.

358
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,750
Congratulations,
Kamin.

359
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:11,458
Thank you.

360
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:20,166
It seems like only
yesterday we had Meribor's
naming ceremony.

361
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,583
Go on.

362
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,750
I remember.

363
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:28,291
I was so nervous,
I was afraid that
I would drop her.

364
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:32,709
Now, look at
the little lady.

365
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,500
Oh, she's no lady,

366
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:38,291
tromping through the
hills with you all day,

367
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,875
digging up those soil samples
you insist upon collecting.

368
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:44,291
No, she's
her father's daughter.

369
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:49,166
I would have believed
that I didn't need children
to complete my life.

370
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,709
Now I couldn't imagine
life without them.

371
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,083
Kamin?
What is it?

372
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,959
(<i> gasping</i> )

373
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,250
Get the doctor.
Hurry!

374
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,542
(<i> gasping</i> )

375
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,250
His respiratory
system's in spasm.

376
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:13,417
Pulse is irregular
and weakening.
I'm losing him.

377
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,250
I'm getting massive
somatophysical failure.

378
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:16,625
Two CCs Delactovine.

379
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:23,083
Data, get that beam back.

380
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,250
There are
severe fluctuations
in the isocortex.

381
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,000
Synaptic responses
are failing.

382
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,542
Begin full cardiac
induction.

383
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,959
Blood pressure is dropping
rapidly-- 70 over 20.

384
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,959
Data, you've got to
reestablish that beam.

385
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,834
I am attempting to
do so, Doctor.

386
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:37,959
Losing response
in the isocortex.

387
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,583
Cortical stimulators.

388
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,083
Start at ten percent.

389
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,041
The beam is fully
restored, doctor.

390
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,542
Blood pressure
up to 90 over 40...
and rising.

391
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,000
Isocortical functions
are stabilizing.

392
00:26:56,041 --> 00:27:00,083
Vital signs
are approaching normal.

393
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,959
Meribor.

394
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,375
Happy day, Father.

395
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:14,500
Hey, that's my hobby.
Find your own.

396
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,166
You're the one
who taught me.

397
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:19,250
Don't complain if you
turned me into a scientist.

398
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:22,709
And what has the scientist
been up to today?

399
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,542
Analyzing soil samples.

400
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:28,542
There isn't
any anaerobic bacteria.

401
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,333
The soil is dead.

402
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:35,250
This isn't just
a very long drought,
is it, Father?

403
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:37,709
I have entries in my log
that go back ten years.

404
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,625
You have data preceding
that for 15 years.

405
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:42,750
You've reached
the same conclusion.
I know you have.

406
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:45,166
I haven't reached
any conclusion.

407
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:48,166
A good scientist doesn't
function by conjecture.

408
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,000
A good scientist functions
by hypothesizing

409
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:53,291
and then proving or
disproving that hypothesis.

410
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,041
That's what I did.

411
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:58,041
Hey, why don't you
spend more time with
that young man Dannick?

412
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,792
You're changing
the subject.
No, I'm not.

413
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:04,792
I'm just hypothesizing
that he's in love with you.

414
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:08,625
You've taught me to
pursue the truth,

415
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,583
no matter how painful it is.

416
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,959
It's too late
to back off now.

417
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,709
This planet is dying.

418
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

419
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:23,750
Perhaps I should have
filled your head with
trivial concerns.

420
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:26,000
Games and toys
and clothes.

421
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,417
I don't think
you mean that.

422
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,291
No, I don't.

423
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:36,375
(<i> sighs</i> )
It just... saddens me

424
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:38,709
to see you...

425
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,083
burdened with the knowledge
of things you can't change.

426
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:48,166
Father, I think
I should marry Dannick

427
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:51,375
sooner rather than later,
don't you?

428
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:54,667
Seize the time, Meribor.

429
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:56,333
Live now.

430
00:28:56,375 --> 00:29:02,125
Make now always
the most precious time.

431
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:05,291
Now will never
come again.

432
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:09,625
I love you, Father.

433
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,542
His vital signs
are holding.

434
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:22,333
They've been stable
ever since the beam
was restored.

435
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:24,208
LA FORGE:
Commander Riker,

436
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,834
we've started to
receive telemetry from
the probe we launched.

437
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:30,375
Go ahead.
We've charted the alien
probe's radiation trail

438
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:31,792
for over one light year.

439
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:33,667
Any way to
extrapolate an origin?

440
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:37,375
Looks like a star
system in the Silarian
sector-- Kataan.

441
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:39,542
Never heard of it.
Data?

442
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:42,083
It is an unmapped system
of six planets, sir.

443
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,500
Any of them inhabited?

444
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:46,250
Not any longer, sir.
The star went nova.

445
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,375
All life in this system
was destroyed

446
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,417
approximately
1,000 years ago.

447
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,500
I put away your shoes
for you again.

448
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:15,041
Yes. Thank you, dear.

449
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,667
You know, I've been
looking through this
thing on and off

450
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:25,041
for over 30 years,
and I still don't see

451
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,458
what you and Meribor
find so fascinating.

452
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,166
Fine. Then maybe
you'll sit down

453
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,041
and have a rest
as you're supposed to.

454
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:36,250
Oh, you treat me
like some frail flower.

455
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:37,959
People have surgery
all the time.

456
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,875
Hmm.

457
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:43,333
(<i> flute music playing</i> )

458
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,583
He loves playing.

459
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,625
He's quite good at it,
don't you think?

460
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:51,166
Well, he loves doing
a lot of things.

461
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:54,250
Last week, all he wanted
to do was be a botanist--

462
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:57,875
the week before that,
a sculptor.

463
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:02,041
I wish he could find
some focus in his life.

464
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,417
I think he has.

465
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,333
Maybe you should
talk to him.

466
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:15,625
Batai?

467
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:24,333
Father?

468
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,959
I get the feeling
from your mother

469
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,959
that you have
something to tell me.

470
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,333
Yes.

471
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:42,125
I was waiting
for the right moment,

472
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,667
but that will never come.

473
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:47,709
I'm leaving school.

474
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,458
Leaving school?
No, you're not!

475
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,875
I want to concentrate
on my music.

476
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:53,875
That's what I care about.

477
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:56,250
Well, last year, all you
cared about was mathematics.

478
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,834
The year before that,
botany. Now...

479
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,125
But through it<i> all,</i>

480
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:04,250
there was my music.

481
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:08,834
I think you know that,
Father.

482
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,542
This is the life I want.

483
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:17,959
Well, we'll, um...

484
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,333
we'll discuss it.

485
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,583
Thank you, Father.

486
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:23,458
Hmm...

487
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:31,500
Even after
all these years,

488
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:35,083
you still have the ability
to surprise me.

489
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:39,875
If music is what he
wants, why should I
stand in his way?

490
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:50,041
Anyway, who knows
how much time

491
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:54,125
he'll have
to follow any dream?

492
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:58,125
Are you still planning
to talk to the
administrator tomorrow?

493
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,458
Mm-hmm.
There's a possibility

494
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,417
he'll dismiss me
from the council.

495
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,625
Unless, of course,
you keep quiet.

496
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:07,750
No. The evidence
is too pronounced.

497
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:11,625
I can't stay silent.

498
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:13,875
What a surprise.

499
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:21,542
Kamin, what do you
hope to accomplish?

500
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,166
Spreading rumors
that the planet is doomed?

501
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,291
There could be chaos.

502
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,458
The facts are here.

503
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,583
At least
show them to someone

504
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:29,000
who will recognize
what they mean.

505
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,709
I won't be a party
to your making trouble.

506
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,041
Well, then,
if you won't take them,
I most certainly will.

507
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:46,542
Your observations...
your findings.

508
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:50,208
Our scientists reached
those same conclusions
two years ago.

509
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,917
Well, what did you
expect us to do?

510
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,166
Make it public?

511
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:56,834
Can you imagine
the effect?

512
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,375
But surely the
technology must exist

513
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,250
to save<i> something</i> 
of this world.

514
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:06,291
Perhaps...
perhaps some people
could be evacuated.

515
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:09,750
Evacuated where?
Our technology is limited.

516
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,166
We're just beginning to
launch small missiles.

517
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:14,166
A collection
of genetic samples.

518
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,750
Something. Anything.

519
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,458
You simply cannot let
this civilization die.

520
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,917
Enough.

521
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:25,792
There is a plan in work.

522
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:28,542
I cannot tell you
more than that.

523
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,417
Father!

524
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:31,542
What is it?

525
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,208
It's mother. Hurry.

526
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:42,166
Doctor?

527
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:47,083
Kamin, I'm sorry.

528
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:50,250
You see?

529
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:54,542
I'll go to any length
to get your attention.

530
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:57,792
You always did have a flair
for the dramatic.

531
00:34:57,834 --> 00:35:00,208
Doctor, thank you.

532
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,667
Batai?

533
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:09,542
Leave us alone
for a moment.

534
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:11,583
I...

535
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:14,417
I need to talk
to my husband.

536
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:25,709
Did you show
the administrator
your evidence?

537
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,542
I didn't have to.

538
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,083
They already knew.

539
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:34,834
So... he won't throw you
off the council?

540
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,291
No.

541
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,875
Good.

542
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:48,458
Remember.

543
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,417
Put your shoes away.

544
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:55,291
I promise.

545
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,083
(<i> playful cackling</i> )

546
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:25,000
I got you, got you,
I got you.

547
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,792
Now I've got you.

548
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,917
Some children
are certainly making
a lot of noise in here.

549
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,917
You shouldn't be
outside so long.

550
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,291
It's damaging.
You know that.

551
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,166
I'm wearing plenty of
your skin protector.

552
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,917
How about you,
young man?

553
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:45,458
Do you wear your skin
protector outdoors?

554
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,750
You do?

555
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:48,583
Good boy.

556
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:49,834
Happy day,
everybody.

557
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,291
It's time to go
see the launching.

558
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,792
What launching?
What is he talking about?

559
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:55,417
They're sending up
a missile, Father.

560
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:56,959
We are going to watch it.

561
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,208
Well, I'm not going
anywhere to watch anything.

562
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,667
Come on, Kamie.
Hurry up, now.

563
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:05,083
Let's go see
the launching.

564
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:11,375
Breaks my heart
to look at him.

565
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:12,834
Who?

566
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:15,000
My grandson.

567
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,583
Breaks my heart.

568
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:24,667
He deserves a rich,
full life, and he's
not going to get one.

569
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,750
Please come, Father.

570
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:41,041
Why didn't I hear anything
about a launching?

571
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,500
(<i> chuckling</i> )

572
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:51,834
Did everyone know
about this except me?

573
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:57,458
I'll, uh, I'll be
all right sitting here.

574
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,709
You go off
with the others.

575
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,375
Hold onto my grandson

576
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:04,333
and watch the damned
thing go up, for all
the good it will do.

577
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,917
What is it
they're launching?

578
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,875
You know about it,
Father.

579
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:15,000
You've already seen it.

580
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:16,250
Seen it?

581
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,166
What are you
talking about?

582
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,875
I haven't seen
any missile.

583
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:21,750
BATAI:
Yes, you have, old friend.

584
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:23,875
Don't you remember?

585
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:34,166
Batai.

586
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:40,417
You saw it just
before you came here.

587
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:44,500
We hoped our probe
would encounter someone
in the future--

588
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:47,208
someone who
could be a teacher--

589
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,500
someone who could tell
the others about us.

590
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:53,542
Oh...

591
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,792
Oh, it's me.

592
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,834
Isn't it?

593
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:02,458
I'm the someone.

594
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,875
I'm the one it finds.

595
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:12,667
That's what
this launching is--

596
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:16,959
a probe that finds me
in the future.

597
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:18,500
ELINE:
Yes, my love.

The rest of us have been
gone a thousand years.

600
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:35,709
If you remember what we were
and how we lived,

601
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,917
then we'll have
found life again.

Tell them of us,
my darling.

Something's
happening.

607
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,333
The nucleonic beam
has ceased, Commander.

608
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,583
The probe has shut down.

His cerebral functions
are stabilizing.

610
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,709
Mr. Worf, put a tractor beam
on that probe.

611
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,500
I want it in Shuttle Bay 2
for examination.

612
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:31,041
Yes, Commander.

613
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,458
What?

614
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:40,500
Please, Captain,
don't get up too quickly.

How long...?

619
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,583
20, 25 minutes.

Captain, I want you
in sick bay.

I'd like to run
a full diagnostic on you.

Hello, sir.

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,041
Feeling better?

Yes.
Yes, thank you.

I'm having to rediscover
that this is really my home.

631

We were able to open
the probe and examine it.

632
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,542
Apparently, whatever
had locked onto you

633
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:47,125
must have been
self-terminating.

634
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:50,875
It isn't functioning
any longer.
