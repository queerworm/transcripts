1
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:05,583
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44143.7.</i>

2
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:09,667
<i>We have moved into Sector 21947</i>
<i>in response to a distress call</i>

3
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:11,834
<i>from a Talarian</i>
<i>observation craft.</i>

4
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:15,750
<i>The alien vessel appears</i>
<i>adrift, and our initial scans</i>

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,625
<i>have detected a</i>
<i>life-threatening radiation leak</i>

6
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:19,875
<i>within its propulsion system.</i>

7
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,500
I get no further response
from the vessel.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,917
Maintain
an open channel.

9
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:26,125
Dr. Crusher and
her assistants

10
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,959
are waiting in
Transporter Room Three.

11
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:31,917
Sir, may I remind
you that during the
Galen border conflict

12
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:34,125
it was a common tactic
of the Talarians

13
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,083
to abandon
their observation craft

14
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,542
rig them to self-destruct...

15
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:39,208
And issue
a general distress call.

16
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,041
Yes, Mr. Data, I know.

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,750
That particular
guerrilla maneuver

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,583
resulted in 219 fatalities
over a three-day period.

19
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,667
Is there any way to detect
their self-destruct device?

20
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,208
Negative, sir.

21
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The Talarians employ
a subspace proximity detonator.

22
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,792
It is not detectable
by our scans.

23
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:57,542
Or the away team's tricorders.

24
00:00:57,542 --> 00:00:59,333
Right.

25
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,875
Captain, the Talarian warship,
the<i> Q'Maire</i> is responding

26
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,125
to the distress call.

27
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,291
Position?

28
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,542
Halfway through
the Woden Sector.

29
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:07,750
It'll take them hours

30
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,542
to get here, sir,
even at maximum warp.

31
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:10,834
Counselor?

32
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:12,959
There<i> is</i> life onboard,
and it's fading.

33
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,667
Number One, assemble
the rest of your away team.

34
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:18,166
Prepare for immediate
rescue operations.

35
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,250
Yes, sir.

36
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,625
Ancillary power is failing.

37
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:49,458
(<i> moaning</i> )

38
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,792
They're nothing more
than children.

39
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:05,041
I am Commander Riker, of the
Federation Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

40
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,333
We will evacuate you
and give you medical care.

41
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,792
You will not be harmed.

42
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:11,709
<i>Enterprise,</i> prepping
five Talarian males

43
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,667
for transport immediately
to Sick Bay.

44
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,542
Trauma team,
stand by to receive the injured.

45
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:16,792
We have
radiation burns

46
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:18,625
and possible
respiratory
distress.

47
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,542
TRANSPORTER OFFICER:
Transport locked in
and ready, Doctor.

48
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,083
Stand by for
my orders.

49
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,208
Captain, this appears to be
a basic training ship.

50
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,417
Five boys, all teens,
all wearing uniforms.

51
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,542
PICARD:
Proceed with the evacuation,
Number One.

52
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,959
No other life signs
aboard, sir.

53
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,792
Commander, quickly.

54
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:36,834
What is it?

55
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,041
This boy, he's human.

56
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,542
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

57
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,333
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

58
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,208
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

59
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,291
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

60
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,917
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,792
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

62
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,709
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

63
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,834
<i>We have completed</i>
<i>an emergency evacuation</i>

64
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:41,875
<i>of four Talarians</i>
<i>and one human.</i>

65
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,667
<i>How this young man</i>
<i>found himself</i>

66
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,041
<i>in the company of these aliens</i>
<i>remains a mystery.</i>

67
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,667
It's Jono, right?

68
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,542
Is that what I heard
them call you?

69
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,208
I'm Dr. Crusher.

70
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,458
I'm just examining you
for radiation injuries.

71
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,542
It won't hurt.

72
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,917
I have a son
not much older than you.

73
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:01,375
Perhaps you'd like to meet him.

74
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,500
Hmm?

75
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,583
Well, Jono

76
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,125
you seem to have escaped
radiation damage.

77
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,208
Pretty lucky.

78
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,291
Dr. Crusher.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,625
Now, how did<i> this</i> happen?

80
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,166
(<i> wailing</i> )

81
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,917
(<i> all wailing</i> )

82
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:28,375
What is it?

83
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,834
They're terrified.

84
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,792
(<i> wailing</i> )

85
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,542
They all just
started up.

86
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,083
Please, may I have
your attention?

87
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:45,291
(<i> wailing continues</i> )

88
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,166
<i>Please,</i> may I have
your attention?

89
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,667
Stop that immediately!

90
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:53,959
(<i> wailing stops abruptly</i> )

91
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, that's better.

92
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,667
Now, what's your name,
young man?

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,500
He won't talk, Captain.

94
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,041
We haven't been able
to get through to him.

95
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:10,458
Captain.

96
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,458
I am Jono.

97
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,625
Take me home
to<i> my</i> Captain.

98
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,959
Take me home to Endar.

99
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,125
He managed to escape
radiation trauma

100
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,917
but the scan shows
something else.

101
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:27,000
What?

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,208
Two previously fractured ribs

103
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,750
a broken arm
and a low-grade concussion.

104
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,500
There might be
neurological impairment.

105
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,875
I'd like
to examine him further.

106
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:37,792
Jean-Luc, the Talarians
have been known

107
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,875
to be ruthless
to their enemies.

108
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,250
I think there's
a real possibility

109
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,667
they may have
brutalized the child.

110
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,500
Isn't it possible
that the injuries

111
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,750
were caused prior
to his captivity?

112
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,250
Hmm, not likely.

113
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,792
He's been with them
a long time--

114
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:57,792
long enough to assimilate
their cultural traits.

115
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,542
And calcium trace patterns
indicate

116
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:02,542
that the injuries took place
during the past seven years.

117
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,083
But if they<i> have</i> abused the boy

118
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,542
why would he so devoutly wish
to return to them?

119
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,709
Oh, it's not uncommon.

120
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:11,542
It was identified centuries ago
as the Stockholm Syndrome.

121
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:14,750
(<i> grunting</i> )

122
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,542
TROI:
Jono! What is it?

123
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,125
Get him! Get him!

124
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,083
Oh!

125
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,417
TROI:
Jono!

126
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:28,041
(<i> grunts</i> )

127
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,959
I just suggested
he take off his gloves.

128
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,709
Suddenly, he lost control.

129
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:33,083
Security, we need
some assistance down
here in Sick Bay.

130
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,291
Don't hurt him.

131
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,625
Hey, no.

132
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,208
Jono.
She won't leave
me alone.

133
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,834
She's keeps trying
to dissect me!

134
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,125
She was trying
to help you.

135
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,458
I don't want her help!

136
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,125
Send me back with my brothers!

137
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,917
Send us back to Captain Endar!

138
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,625
Jono, I want you to
stop this immediately!

139
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,583
Yes, Captain.

140
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,792
Good. That's better.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,333
Now, if we're to
accomplish anything...

142
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,458
Data to Picard.

143
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,166
Go ahead.

144
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,792
We have received
a subspace communiquÃ©

145
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,333
from Starfleet Command
regarding the young human, sir.

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,166
Very well.

147
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,500
Doctor, Counselor.

148
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,000
Lieutenant Worf

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,417
escort this young man
to quarters.

150
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,000
He is to be confined there
until further notice.

151
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,291
Yes, Doctor.

152
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,583
Why are you here,
Klingon, with them?

153
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,583
Did they capture
you, too?

154
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,583
They are not my captors.

155
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,125
They are my comrades.

156
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,875
Why do you take orders
from a female?

157
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,041
Dr. Crusher.

158
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,208
She is my superior officer.

159
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,959
Among my people, a female
can never outrank a man.

160
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,166
You are human.

161
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,500
And among humans

162
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,417
females can achieve
anything the males can.

163
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:52,500
I am no more human than you are.

164
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,959
I am Talarian.

165
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,000
You are confused.

166
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,959
(<i> wailing</i> )

167
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:01,875
Stop that!

168
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,291
(<i> stops abruptly</i> )

169
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,291
I will make the<i> B'Nar--</i>
the mourning--

170
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,166
until I am back
with my brothers.

171
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,125
(<i> wailing</i> )

172
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:16,583
(<i> wailing stops and starts</i> )

173
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,583
By matching DNA gene types

174
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,959
Starfleet was able to identify
the boy as Jeremiah Rossa.

175
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,000
Rossa?

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,583
As in Admiral
Rossa?

177
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,667
She is his grandmother,
Captain.

178
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,583
He was born 14 years ago

179
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,083
on the Federation colony,
Galen IV.

180
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,875
His parents, Connor
and Moira Rossa, were killed

181
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,417
three years, nine months later

182
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:39,250
when their colony was overrun
by Talarian forces.

183
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,166
I remember.
There were no survivors.

184
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,208
The boy was listed

185
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,834
as missing
and presumed dead.

186
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,208
I know another Rossa

187
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,667
who was killed in action
at the Krasner outpost.

188
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,625
Tragedy seems
to follow that family.

189
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,333
The Admiral lost
both her sons.

190
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,709
Well, now she'll
have something
to celebrate.

191
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:55,959
Captain, if Jeremiah
is returned

192
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,834
to his family in his
present condition

193
00:09:57,834 --> 00:10:00,375
it will be a wrenching
experience for everyone

194
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,166
especially for him.

195
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,500
He needs to rediscover
his identity

196
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,792
make some connection
with his roots.

197
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,166
I agree.

198
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,291
Do what you can
to accomplish that, Counselor.

199
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't think
<i>I</i> can do anything, Captain.

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,959
Why not?

201
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,125
CRUSHER:
Troi's right.

202
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,417
It's very clear that the boy

203
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,792
does not respond well to women.

204
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:22,208
The Talarians are a rigidly
patriarchal society, sir.

205
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,417
Jeremiah needs to build
a relationship with a man--

206
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,583
a father figure with whom
he can explore his origins.

207
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:32,041
And I think
it should be you, Captain.

208
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,709
Oh, no, Counselor.

209
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,750
Oh, no, Counselor,
I don't think so.

210
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,959
He needs someone
who is trained in these matters.

211
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,000
You are the only person

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,959
with whom he has shown
any connection.

213
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:52,125
If he is to find his... humanity

214
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,667
then you are the only one
who can help him.

215
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,875
It's up to you,
Captain.

216
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

217
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:04,166
(<i> wailing</i> )

218
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,458
Jono.

219
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,500
Jono, why do you make
that noise?

220
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,500
It is the custom of my people
when we are in distress.

221
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,709
Isn't it also
the custom of your people

222
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,041
to listen to the wishes
of their Captain?

223
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,083
Yes.

224
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,041
Then, as Captain

225
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,250
of the Starship<i> Enterprise</i>

226
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,458
I ask you
not to make that sound.

227
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,333
Yes, sir.

228
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:29,834
Oh, good.

229
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,125
Well, now that's cleared up

230
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,250
let's, um...

231
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,000
let's, uh...

232
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,000
let's get
acquainted, shall we?

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,917
Uh, what do you
think of your room?

234
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:48,083
I know it's, uh...
it's a little sterile

235
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,125
but if there's anything
you would like...

236
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,792
Um... pictures, perhaps?

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,166
Games?

238
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,875
This is a cage.

239
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,542
I'm still your captive.

240
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,417
Oh, no.
Not at all.

241
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:02,750
I thought
you'd be comfortable here.

242
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,125
Are you going to return me
to<i> my</i> Captain?

243
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:07,125
We will rendezvous
with the Warship<i> Q'Maire</i>

244
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,417
at 0740 hours.

245
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,917
We will transfer the Talarians

246
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:11,709
to Captain Endar.

247
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:13,542
Including me?

248
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:17,500
We'll discuss your situation
with Captain Endar.

249
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,500
I don't like this place.

250
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,875
We could find
some other quarters.

251
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,667
I've always lived
with my Captain.

252
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,458
Ah.

253
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,500
Yes, well,
that wouldn't work here.

254
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,792
Well, I'm sure you'll see

255
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:39,959
there's nothing
here to appeal to
a young person.

256
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,375
Put that down, please.

257
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,667
It's Klingon.

258
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,458
Yes. Would you put it back
where you got it?

259
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,792
Uh...

260
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,250
Well...

261
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,500
Here we are,
eh, Jono?

262
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,458
I notice you haven't taken off
your gloves.

263
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,500
Not here.

264
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,667
Why not?

265
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,583
So that I don't have to touch
an alien.

266
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,375
Jono, your Captain, Endar...

267
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,500
has he ever hurt you?

268
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,125
Inflicted pain?

269
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,750
Pain is not a consideration.

270
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,417
Then he has.

271
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,750
I did not say that.

272
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,000
Don't you understand?

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,250
Pain is not what matters.

274
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,041
Passing the tests is everything.

275
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,583
Is that what they are--
tests of pain?

276
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,750
You understand nothing.

277
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,625
It's true, I don't
fully understand Talarians

278
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,667
but<i> you</i> are not Talarian.

279
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,959
I will not listen to this.

280
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,375
I will not listen to your lies.

281
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

282
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:12,917
(<i> door chimes</i> )

283
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,166
Come.

284
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,125
You wanted to see me, Captain?

285
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,083
Yes, Counselor.

286
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,291
Please, come in.
Sit down.

287
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,000
You're probably not
aware of this

288
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,458
but I've never been
particularly comfortable

289
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,583
around children.

290
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,583
Really?

291
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,250
For some reason, they just
don't seem to respond to me.

292
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,333
I see.

293
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:53,083
Frankly, I think that my time
would be best served

294
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,542
carrying out the duties
and responsibilities

295
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:56,834
of a Starfleet Captain.

296
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:01,709
Seldom have I heard
an explanation so...

297
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,250
well-rehearsed.

298
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,792
Look, Counselor, I...

299
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:09,250
I just feel that I'm not
the right person for this job.

300
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,250
Strange, isn't it?

301
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,959
You'll travel light-years

302
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,333
dodge asteroid storms,
brave hostile aliens

303
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,542
and yet, when asked
to assume a parental
role, you cringe.

304
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,208
Why do you suppose
that is?

305
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,667
I'm not cringing.

306
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,542
I'm just...

307
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,208
acknowledging my limitations.

308
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,291
When you were a
child, did you
have any friends?

309
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,792
Other children you played with?

310
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:43,959
I don't think that this

311
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,333
has anything
to do with anything.

312
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:47,583
(<i> clears throat</i> )

313
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,291
Well, perhaps it was because...

314
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:56,875
This is foolish.

315
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,750
What were you
going to say?

316
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:07,792
It's just that...

317
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,333
ever since I was a child,
I've always known

318
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,542
<i>exactly</i> what I wanted to do--
be a member of Starfleet.

319
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,125
Nothing else mattered to me.

320
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:21,542
Virtually my entire youth
was spent

321
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:22,875
in the pursuit of that goal.

322
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,750
In fact...

323
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,792
I probably skipped my childhood
altogether.

324
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,000
You know, Captain

325
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,750
almost no one is born
being a good parent.

326
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:39,500
Most people just
have to muddle through

327
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,333
and do the best that they can.

328
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,917
Are you saying that's what
I'm going to have to do?

329
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,250
Yes.

330
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,959
And you might be surprised
at just how good you can be.

331
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,792
(<i> sighs</i> )

332
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,166
(<i> muffled, discordant</i>
<i>string music playing</i> )

333
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:09,333
(<i> music playing loudly</i> )

334
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,375
Computer!

335
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,750
Turn off that noise!

336
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,875
(<i> music stops</i> )

337
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,125
Computer, what...?

338
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,709
What was that?

339
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,125
The<i> Alba Ra,</i> a contemporary
Talarian musical form.

340
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,458
Jono?

341
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,625
Jono, where are you?

342
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,291
You turned off my music.

343
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,417
Yes, I most certainly did

344
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,333
and I expect it
to<i> stay</i> turned off.

345
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:55,875
Would you come down
from there?

346
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,917
I see you made yourself at home.

347
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,041
I cannot rest on your beds.

348
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,417
They hurt my back.

349
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,125
Will you come here?

350
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,375
There's something
I want to show you.

351
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,083
Those are Connor

352
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,166
and Moira Rossa.

353
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,667
They are your parents.

354
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:36,083
The baby...

355
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,542
is you.

356
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,250
Jeremiah Rossa.

357
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:44,333
My name is Jono.

358
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,917
Well, you were born Jeremiah

359
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,500
on Galen IV.

360
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,583
The colony was
destroyed later

361
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,917
during a border skirmish.

362
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,542
Hmm.

363
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,208
See?

364
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,583
You knew how to laugh once.

365
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,000
Do you remember

366
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,208
any of this, Jono?

367
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,750
Your parents, your home?

368
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,917
I know that Endar rescued me.

369
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,417
He told me so.

370
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,333
Jono, your parents were killed
by the Talarians.

371
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,667
It was war.

372
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:20,208
Death is part of war.

373
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,375
RIKER:
Captain?

374
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,041
Yes, what is it,
Number One?

375
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,625
We've established visual contact
with the Warship<i> Q'Maire.</i>

376
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,083
Endar!

377
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,166
Hey! Hey!

378
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,125
You... stay put.

379
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,667
I'm on my way,
Number One.

380
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,458
MAN:
<i>Get to cover!</i>

381
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,500
WOMAN:
<i>I can't leave you!</i>

382
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,041
(<i> phasers zapping</i> )

383
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,291
MAN:
<i>Take Jeremiah.</i>
<i>Get to the forest.</i>

384
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,667
<i>I'll hold them off.</i>

385
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,959
WOMAN:
<i>No! No! Come with us!</i>

386
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,208
MAN:
<i>No!</i>

387
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,917
BOY (<i> sobbing</i> ):
Mama! Mama!

388
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,917
WOMAN (<i> sobbing</i> ):<i> </i>
<i>Jeremiah... Jeremiah!</i>

389
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:22,500
(<i> explosions and screams</i> )

390
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,458
(<i> boy sobbing</i> )

391
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,333
<i>Mama...</i>

392
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,041
(<i> sobbing fades</i> )

393
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,625
Status, Mr. Data?

394
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,917
<i>Q'Maire</i> at station.

395
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:43,208
Holding steady at
bearing 013 mark 015.

396
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,125
Distance-- 506
kilometers.

397
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,333
Are its weapons systems active?

398
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,834
Negative, sir.

399
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:52,417
Captain Endar requests
an open channel, sir.

400
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,500
On screen.

401
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,667
I am Captain Endar
of the Warship<i> Q'Maire.</i>

402
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,333
To whom am I speaking?

403
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,625
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

404
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,000
of the Federation Starship
<i>Enterprise.</i>

405
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,083
We have rescued
four crew members

406
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,625
from your observation craft.

407
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,333
They have received
medical attention.

408
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,875
They are ready for transport.

409
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,125
Your actions are duly noted.

410
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,667
We will forward coordinates
for immediate transport.

411
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,250
You're welcome, I'm sure.

412
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,375
One moment, Captain.

413
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,917
We've also discovered
a human among your crew.

414
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,375
Jono.

415
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,375
Actually, his name

416
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,208
is Jeremiah...

417
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,917
Jeremiah Rossa.

418
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,792
What is his condition?

419
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,250
Is he injured?

420
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,125
He was not wounded
in the mishap

421
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,041
but as a representative
of the Federation

422
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,041
I require an explanation.

423
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:47,125
Why has this child been
held in your custody

424
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,583
for so many years?

425
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,375
No explanation is warranted,
Captain.

426
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:53,917
He is my son.

427
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,083
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

428
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,583
<i>Captain Endar's claim</i>
<i>that Jeremiah Rossa is his son</i>

429
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,333
<i>is clearly unacceptable.</i>

430
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,375
<i>However, to avoid</i>
<i>escalating tensions</i>

431
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,208
<i>I have invited</i>
<i>the Talarian leader</i>

432
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,917
<i>to come aboard the</i> Enterprise

433
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:19,333
<i>so that we may address</i>
<i>the issue face-to-face.</i>

434
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,375
Yes, I was in charge
of the force

435
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,458
that repelled
the trespassers
on Galen IV.

436
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,208
I must say,
your Federation troops

437
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,041
fought tenaciously.

438
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,083
Among them,
Connor and Moira Rossa.

439
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:33,917
I suppose.

440
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,208
After the battle, I found

441
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,583
this squalling child
huddled by a body.

442
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,667
of a young woman,
his mother, presumably.

443
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,834
There was almost no one
left alive on Galen IV.

444
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:46,667
Was I to leave him screaming
over his mother's body?

445
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:49,083
You should have notified
the Federation authorities.

446
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,458
To conceal him was a clear
violation of our agreement.

447
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,834
I took him in accordance
with my people's traditions.

448
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,542
What tradition is it

449
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:01,208
that empowered you
to capture a helpless child?

450
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:04,500
I lost my son
at the hands of humans

451
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,959
during the conflict
over Castal I.

452
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,125
Talarian custom allows me

453
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,959
to claim the son
of a slain enemy.

454
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,291
Does that custom extend

455
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,542
to brutalizing
the surrogate son?

456
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,500
What are you talking about?

457
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,625
Our medical officer discovered
evidence of injuries so severe

458
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,500
they might be
considered torture.

459
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,792
Nonsense.

460
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,417
I've never harmed Jono.

461
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:32,000
Then explain the fractured ribs,
concussion, broken arm.

462
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,125
(<i> laughs</i> )

463
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,166
Broken arm.

464
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,959
Youth!

465
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,542
Have you ever
been a father, Picard?

466
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:42,959
Have you ever had a son
desperately trying

467
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:45,333
to win your approval,
your respect?

468
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:51,709
Jono broke his ribs
riding on a<i> t'stayan.</i>

469
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:55,500
Six hooves,
a very powerful beast.

470
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,000
The arm...

471
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
in a contest with other youths.

472
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,875
He endured the pain

473
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,333
and won
the competition.

474
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,917
One day, he will be
a great warrior.

475
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,166
Doesn't he deserve to
become more than that?

476
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,917
His true heritage
is human, Endar.

477
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,458
A heritage long
since forgotten.

478
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:23,333
While onboard,
you are welcome to supervise

479
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,458
the return of your crew

480
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,750
but I cannot allow
Jeremiah Rossa

481
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,750
to be returned to your custody.

482
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,792
His true family are waiting
for him on Earth.

483
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,041
Ah.

484
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,250
Then under no
circumstances

485
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,041
will I allow your ship
to leave our territory.

486
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:43,583
I have already reported
our position

487
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,000
and the nature
of this violation to Starfleet.

488
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,125
And I've already called

489
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,291
for reserve forces
into this sector.

490
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,208
Are you saying
that you are willing

491
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,125
to go to war over this boy?

492
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,333
Would you not,
for your only son?

493
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,583
We have been at peace
for many years.

494
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,083
Let us not rush
headlong into war.

495
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,542
Then help me
to avoid it.

496
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:08,208
If you will allow
me to see Jono

497
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:11,375
it will be clear to you
I have been a good father.

498
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,333
He's grown up happy
in my keeping.

499
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,417
So, you think it
would it be unwise
to let Endar see Jono?

500
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:22,583
I think
it might be dangerous.

501
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:23,875
Abusers can have subtle

502
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,083
but powerful influence
over their victims.

503
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:29,834
You see, I'm not convinced
the boy has been abused, Doctor.

504
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:31,041
I've talked with the father

505
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:34,375
and, if I'm
any judge of character

506
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,959
I would say that he cares deeply
for the boy's welfare.

507
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:39,500
I sense awakening memories
in the boy.

508
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,375
This is a very fragile time
for Jono.

509
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,834
If we send away the man
he calls "father"

510
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,291
without even letting them
see each other

511
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:49,583
how would we ever gain
his trust?

512
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,375
Yes.

513
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,834
There is something else
to keep in mind.

514
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,959
We are deep
in Talarian territory.

515
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:58,417
A semblance of diplomacy
is called for.

516
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,083
I'm going to agree
to the meeting.

517
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:03,583
All I ask is that the visit
be supervised.

518
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:05,500
Don't let them
be alone together.

519
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,667
Agreed.

520
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:17,125
Endar.

521
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:21,792
Jono, my son.

522
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:32,667
Have they
treated you well?

523
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,250
Yes, Captain.

524
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,000
Except...

525
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,041
Except what?

526
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,125
I was forbidden
to make the<i> B'Nar.</i>

527
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,667
Ah.

528
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:46,417
That's all right.

529
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,375
I know you've mourned
in your heart.

530
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,542
Well, Jono...

531
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,583
what do you think
of these humans?

532
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,375
They look like me.

533
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:01,166
They want to keep you, you know.

534
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,250
Yes, I know.

535
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:09,000
You've reached
the Age of Decision.

536
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,417
What is your choice?

537
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:17,041
Do you want to stay?

538
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:21,667
No.

539
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:22,667
Of course not.

540
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:23,875
Then you shall not.

541
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,083
I'm returning to the<i> Q'Maire.</i>

542
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,417
I will give the humans a choice.

543
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:38,875
If they do not make the one
we know is right

544
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,125
it may lead to war.

545
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,041
You may die.

546
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,041
I am ready to die.

547
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,417
WORF:
Captain, sensors
indicate

548
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,959
two warships
approaching

549
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,667
from the opposite
direction along
the border.

550
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:03,792
Mr. Data, what's
their offensive potential?

551
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:05,792
(<i> beeping</i> )

552
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,166
Talarian warships
are limited

553
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:08,667
to neutral particle weapons

554
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,417
high-energy X-ray lasers
and Merculite rockets.

555
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:13,709
No match for
the<i> Enterprise,</i> Captain.

556
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:15,291
Mm-hmm.

557
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,750
The last thing
I want is to
be forced

558
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,583
into destroying
one of their ships.

559
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,291
They won't back off.

560
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,417
They've been willing to fight
to the death in past encounters.

561
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,625
The lines are being drawn.

562
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,917
All this for a chosen son.

563
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:36,041
Captain, is it worth it
to go to war over a child?

564
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,500
CRUSHER:
You might not
ask that, Lieutenant

565
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,041
if it was<i> your</i> child.

566
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,458
There must be a way
to avoid this.

567
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:45,250
If we can just reach
Jono, help him make

568
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,333
some connections
with his origins

569
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,458
he may choose
to come with us.

570
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:51,625
Do you really think
Endar would go along with that?

571
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,542
If Endar respects

572
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,834
Talarian custom,
he may have to.

573
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:58,625
According to their tradition

574
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:01,208
a male child of 14
has reached the Age of Decision.

575
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,792
He then undergoes a ceremony
of initiation

576
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:07,458
after which, he has the freedom
to make his own choices.

577
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,792
Endar's entire claim on Jono
is based on Talarian custom.

578
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,709
He'd have a hard time
backing away from it now.

579
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,667
Captain, there is
a subspace communication

580
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,208
from Starfleet Command.

581
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,667
On screen.

582
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:22,458
Sir, the message
is for Jeremiah Rossa.

583
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,000
Have the boy brought
to my ready room.

584
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:32,166
Jeremiah...

585
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,333
my name is Connaught Rossa.

586
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,250
I am your father's mother.

587
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,917
I wish we could talk in person,
but that will have to wait.

588
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,500
When I heard the miracle
that you were alive

589
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,792
I wanted to reach out to you
as soon as possible.

590
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:51,417
I find myself wondering
what you look like.

591
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,291
All I can do is imagine
your father at your age.

592
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:00,417
You come from a family
that would make you proud.

593
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:03,375
Many of them
have given their lives

594
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:06,542
to bring peace to the galaxy.

595
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:09,250
You are the last of the Rossas.

596
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,375
I was so very thankful
when you were given back to us

597
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,500
to carry on the line.

598
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,083
Your grandfather and I
will greet you

599
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,041
with all the love in our hearts.

600
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,834
Have a safe journey home,
Jeremiah.

601
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:30,917
She wears
a Starfleet uniform.

602
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,166
Yes.

603
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:37,917
What is her rank?

604
00:30:37,917 --> 00:30:39,041
She is an Admiral.

605
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:43,000
She outranks you?

606
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,583
Yes.

607
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:53,542
If I were home now,
I would go to the brae

608
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:55,250
and run along the river
as fast as I could!

609
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,625
Jono...

610
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:59,041
I can't do any of the things
that calm me here.

611
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:00,375
You won't let me have
my music.

612
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,333
You won't let me make
the<i> B'Nar.</i>

613
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:04,542
I feel if I stay still
much longer, I will die.

614
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:09,041
Jono...

615
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,917
let me show you
what I do when I
have these feelings.

616
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:12,959
Come on.

617
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:24,041
Now, you can serve
from within either
of these two sections

618
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,125
by bouncing the ball
and hitting it

619
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,000
into that top center target.

620
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,250
Now you have to return the ball
before it bounces twice.

621
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,458
All right?

622
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:33,834
Let's try it.

623
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:38,750
(<i> phaser-like zapping</i> )

624
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,709
Hmm, not bad.

625
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:44,250
I win at all the games.

626
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,875
I can believe it.

627
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,625
(<i> indistinct shouting voices</i> )

628
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:20,875
(<i> blasts and explosions</i> )

629
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,500
Jono?

630
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,709
You all right?

631
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:26,041
I'm fine.

632
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,959
(<i> phaser-like zapping resumes</i> )

633
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,750
(<i> zapping continues</i> )

634
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,959
(<i> Jono grunting</i> )

635
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:44,166
(<i> indistinct shouting voices</i> )

636
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,166
(<i> explosions, phasers firing</i> )

637
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,333
(<i> Jeremiah crying</i> )

638
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,083
MOIRA:
<i>Jeremiah! Jeremiah!</i>

639
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,625
JEREMIAH:
<i>Mama!</i>

640
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,458
No!

641
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,000
Mama!

642
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,625
It's all right.
It's all right.

643
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,542
(<i> sobbing</i> )

644
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,041
She was all red.

645
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:02,792
I cried...

646
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,041
but she didn't answer me.

647
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,875
(<i> sobbing</i> )

648
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,458
She used to
sing to me.

649
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,333
I don't remember
the melody...

650
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,166
just the sound
of her voice.

651
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,375
(<i> sighs</i> )

652
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,667
Before I remembered these things

653
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,000
I was strong.

654
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,417
And now...

655
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,792
It's part of being human, Jono.

656
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:43,166
But as deeply as you feel hurt

657
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,917
you can also feel joy.

658
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,166
I do not think so.

659
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:53,083
I think I will always
feel like this.

660
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,875
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

661
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,250
How was the
racquetball?

662
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,625
Oh, he gave me quite a game
for his first time out.

663
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:07,709
Yes, Captain.

664
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:09,083
I'm looking forward
to next time.

665
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,625
I'm sure you are.
Sit down.

666
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,125
What would
you like?

667
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:19,875
What is that?

668
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,834
This is called a banana split.

669
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:24,625
It's quite possibly one of the
greatest things in the universe.

670
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:25,875
Here, try some.

671
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,333
That is called a spoon.

672
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,792
(<i> laughing</i> )

673
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,083
Forgive me.

674
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,542
(<i> laughing continues</i> )

675
00:34:57,333 --> 00:35:00,667
I-I fail to understand
why this is amusing.

676
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:02,625
Access your data banks
under "humor"

677
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,625
subheading "slapstick."

678
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:07,583
Comedy stressing farce
and horseplay.

679
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:10,208
Ah, this, no doubt,
is a variation

680
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,959
on "pie in the face."

681
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:13,417
Now do you see why it's funny?

682
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:14,834
No, sir.

683
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,875
But I will take your word
for it.

684
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,333
This is very amusing.

685
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,667
Let's try
this again.

686
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,333
I'd like a fresh
banana split

687
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,959
and another one
for my friend here.

688
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,000
Right away.

689
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,542
(<i> Jono chuckling</i> )

690
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,542
Look at him.

691
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:41,375
He's a different person.

692
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:42,834
Who would have thought

693
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:45,250
we'd ever see him laugh
out loud like that?

694
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,500
Just half an hour ago,
he was crying like a baby.

695
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,333
(<i> yells</i> )

696
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,375
Two bleeders,

697
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,709
I need the autosuture here.

698
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:55,792
WOMAN:
Yes, Doctor.

699
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:06,041
Looks like the blade hit
the sternum and was deflected.

700
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,375
It could have been
a lot worse.

701
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,458
It wasn't a dream?

702
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,917
I'm afraid not.

703
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,583
No vital organs pierced.

704
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,542
No major arteries.

00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,125
Where's the boy now?

706
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:24,375
Worf has him in Security.

707
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:26,834
Hold still.

708
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,625
I want to see him.

709
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,041
Here, now.

710
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,709

On screen.

714
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:50,166
Any communication,
Lieutenant Worf?

715
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,250
No, sir.
We have an open channel.

La Forge here, sir.

721
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,250
The Talarians are moving

722
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,583
into attack posture,
classic triangular envelopment.

723
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:10,125
I've tapped the impulse engines
for additional power to shields.

724
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,417
We're ready, Commander.

725
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:13,041
Commander, the
Captain of the<i> Q'Maire</i>

726
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,000
requests
communication.

727
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,125
Here we go.

728
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,583
On screen.

729
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:23,458
Captain Picard,
have you made your decision?

730
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:24,750
This is Commander Riker.

731
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,917
What are your intentions,
Captain Endar?

732
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:28,875
Where is Captain Picard?

733
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,208
He has been injured.

734
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,458
I am in command now.

735
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:32,875
Very well.

736
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:36,083
Please prepare my son
for immediate transport.

737
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:38,083
I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

738
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:41,500
Last night,
Jono attacked Captain Picard

739
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,041
and tried to murder him.

740
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:45,125
We're holding him in custody.

741
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:48,083
If he had been returned to me
with the others

742
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,667
this would never have happened.

743
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:53,375
I hold you responsible
for this incident.

744
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,834
He will have to come
with us now, Endar.

745
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,125
It is up to Starfleet
to decide the consequences.

746
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:01,625
I do not accept that decision.

747
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:06,208
I repeat...

748
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:10,333
you will prepare my son
for immediate transport.

749
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:14,125
If he is not aboard
the<i> Q'Maire</i> in five minutes...

750
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:18,750
you will suffer
the consequences.

751
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:21,917
Red Alert.

752
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:23,917
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

753
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:26,625
Talarian vessels
routing power to
forward rockets.

754
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,959
Ready all weapons,
Mr. Worf.

755
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:31,041
(<i> hushed voices</i> )

756
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:47,083
Jono...

757
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,166
why did you do it?

758
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:51,583
That does not matter.

759
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:54,333
Yes, I think it does.

760
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,875
It matters to me.

761
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,709
What matters is that I
have attacked a Captain.

762
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:00,083
I am ready to be put to death.

763
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:04,792
You think
you're going to be killed?

764
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,709
To attack a superior
is the worst offense.

765
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:09,875
I will die at your hands.

766
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:14,417
Jono...

767
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:16,792
you're not going to die
at my hands or anyone else's.

768
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,333
But I've committed
a terrible crime.

769
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,333
What I want to know is why?

770
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,333
(<i> sighs</i> )

771
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,959
You seemed so happy
just a few hours ago.

772
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:31,667
I was.

773
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:36,000
But then I thought
about my father.

774
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:40,792
I felt I had betrayed him.

775
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:44,625
I'd be throwing away
all that he'd given me--

776
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:47,333
all that I'd learned from him--

777
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:51,000
my home,
running along the river

778
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,291
playing in the games

779
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:55,792
sharing victory
with my brothers.

780
00:40:58,291 --> 00:40:59,750
All the things
that are part of my life.

781
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:07,208
As I grew closer and closer...

782
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,709
to you

783
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:12,417
I knew that meant leaving more
and more of that life behind.

784
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:18,625
Forgive me, Captain

785
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:20,250
but I cannot allow myself
to do that.

786
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:30,542
The<i> Q'Maire</i>
is requesting

787
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,291
communications
on a secure channel.

788
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,834
On screen.

789
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:35,542
ENDAR:
Commander Riker

790
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:39,208
you have failed to transport
my son aboard the<i> Q'Maire.</i>

791
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,792
Our intentions
have not changed, Endar.

792
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:43,375
We're returning him
to Starfleet.

793
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,333
I regret your stubbornness.

794
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,458
Much will be lost.

795
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:51,667
(<i> door opens</i> )

796
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:52,875
PICARD:
One moment, Captain.

797
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,417
Captain Endar...

798
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,917
last night, Jono...

799
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:11,041
attacked me with a dagger.

800
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:12,458
Which he could not have done

801
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:15,083
had he been returned to me
with the others.

802
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:17,250
There was a crime committed
onboard this ship

803
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,417
but it was not Jono's,
it was mine.

804
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:22,166
When we found Jono

805
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,750
it seemed so clear
what had to be done.

806
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,834
We knew that if we could only
persuade him

807
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:30,333
to make the decision to stay

808
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:33,834
then you would
most likely let him.

809
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:35,875
So with the best
of intentions

810
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,375
we tried
to convince him

811
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,625
and in so doing...

812
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:44,792
we thoroughly failed
to listen to<i> his</i> feelings

813
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:46,166
to his<i> needs.</i>

814
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:49,792
That was the crime

815
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:52,417
and it has taken
a huge toll

816
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:58,417
on a strong and a very...
noble young man.

817
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:01,375
And it must be rectified.

818
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:03,834
He will return home

819
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:06,417
to the only home
he's ever known

820
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,166
and to the father that he loves.

821
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,083
To you, Endar.

822
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:17,709
Thank you, Captain.

823
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,709
Please transmit coordinates
for immediate transport.

824
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:41,208
Good-bye, Jono.

825
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:42,542
Good-bye, Captain.

826
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:43,583
Thank you.
