1
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:10,375
Sir, we are approaching
Klavdia 3.

2
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:11,834
Take us to impulse power.

3
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,250
Aye, sir.
Impulse power.

4
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,667
Bridge, this is engineering.

5
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:25,291
PICARD:
Yes, Lieutenant.

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,083
Now that we're out of warp,
I'd like to use this time

7
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,500
to make some
routine adjustments

8
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:30,041
on the deuterium
control conduit.

9
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,625
We're overdue.

10
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:34,959
How much time will these
adjustments require, Lieutenant?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,875
LA FORGE:
A couple of hours, sir.

12
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:39,417
Proceed,
Lieutenant La Forge.

13
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,166
Standard orbit, Ensign.

14
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,417
Wes, I'm gonna need an
S-C-M, model three,

15
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,000
from ship stores.
Can you handle that?

16
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,750
Right away.
All right.

17
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,500
Magnify, Mr. Worf.

18
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:08,250
Hardly an inviting planet.

19
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,291
Even for a research
establishment.

20
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,917
I would have thought
the inhabitants of Daled 4

21
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,667
would send a future leader to a
more hospitable environment.

22
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,917
For some, security
is more important than comfort.

23
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,917
Yes, but 16 years.

24
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,542
WORF:
Captain, we are being hailed.

25
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,667
Hailing frequencies, Mr. Worf.

26
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,125
Open.

27
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:31,458
This is Captain Picard
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,083
(<i> distorted transmission</i> )

29
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,875
Sir, the planet's troposphere
is distorting our signal.

30
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:40,500
Can you clean that up,
Mr. Worf?

31
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:42,375
I'll try.

32
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,542
Now.

33
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,125
This is Picard
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

34
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,500
Please, will you repeat
your message?

35
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:49,834
FEMALE VOICE:
I am Anya.

36
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:53,000
Have you come for
Salia of Daled 4?

37
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,083
That is correct.

38
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,000
ANYA:
What species are you?

39
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,917
Human.

40
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,375
ANYA:
Excellent.

41
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:01,500
Bring us aboard.
That is all.

42
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,041
Friendly, isn't she?

43
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:06,250
Friendly or not, Salia has
the rank of head of state.

44
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,834
So, we shall treat her
and Anya accordingly.

45
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,792
Number One, Mr. Worf,
let's go greet our visitors.

46
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:13,125
You have the bridge,
Mr. Data.

47
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,208
DATA:
Aye, sir.

48
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:32,417
Welcome to the<i> Enterprise.</i> 
I'm Captain Picard.

49
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,875
This is Salia of Daled 4.

50
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,834
I didn't
feel a thing.

51
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,917
Is that normal when one
is transported, Captain?

52
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,583
Oh, yes, it is.

53
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,417
Those must be the matter-
energy conversion controls.

54
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,500
May I take a look?

55
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,291
Yes, of course.

56
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,583
I could arrange for a tour
of the ship, if you'd like.

57
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,709
Oh, I'd love that.

58
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,083
No, that will not
be necessary.

59
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,041
Just show us to
our quarters, Captain Picard.

60
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:01,333
Very well.

61
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,375
We're accomodating you in
quarters normally reserved

62
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,750
for Starfleet admiralty.

63
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:09,959
I'm sure you'll find them
quite comfortable.

64
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:22,041
That's a superconducting
magnet, isn't it?

65
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,834
Yeah, it's an S-C-M model...

66
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,250
How did you know that?

67
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,333
Study. For the last
16 years that's all I've--

68
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,000
Please, Salia.

69
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,291
Walk ahead with me.

70
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,792
Better be careful.

71
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:36,792
Those can rip the iron
right out of your blood cells.

72
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,166
Commander, who is she?

73
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,291
Uh, I think she's
a governess.

74
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,625
No, the girl.

75
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,917
Oh, I don't know if she'll
have time for you, Wes.

76
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,125
She's destined to
rule an entire world.

77
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:25,125
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

78
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:29,625
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

79
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:31,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

80
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:35,000
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

81
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:39,667
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

82
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:43,959
<i>to boldly go where</i>

83
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,291
(<i> door chime</i> )

84
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,667
Come in.

85
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,458
You wanted to see me?

86
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes.

87
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,583
Data, the girl
who came on board...

88
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,333
Salia of Daled 4.

89
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,542
Who is she?

90
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,834
Little is known.

91
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,041
She was born on Daled 4.

92
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,875
Her parents were
from opposite sides

93
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:03,250
in a civil war
which has lasted for centuries.

94
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,792
They both died shortly
after her birth.

95
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:09,291
A Federation ship brought her
and her governess to Klavdia 3

96
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,875
so that she could be raised
in a neutral environment.

97
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,667
And now, she's returning?

98
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:17,000
It is hoped she will unite
the factions and bring peace.

99
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,458
LA FORGE:
Ensign Crusher, report.

100
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,583
Are you all right?

101
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,500
Geordi?

102
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:23,041
Yeah, I'm fine. I just--

103
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,458
LA FORGE: Wes, we're waiting
for that magnet.

104
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,208
I'm on my way.

105
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:39,375
Captain, we've
broke in orbit

106
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:41,041
and laid in a course
for Daled 4.

107
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,542
And we will remain
on impulse power

108
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,333
until Lieutenant La Forge
completes his adjustments.

109
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,333
Mr. Worf, have our
passengers accomodations

110
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,041
met with their approval?

111
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:53,083
I doubt if anything ever meets
with that woman's approval, sir.

112
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:57,959
Captain, I'm concerned
about our new passengers.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,041
Their emotions
do not fit

114
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,291
who they are and
what they're doing.

115
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,959
Are you suggesting they're
not who they say they are?

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,667
Actually, no.
It's more like

117
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,750
they're not<i> what</i> 
they say they are.

118
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,542
Picard, Salia's quarters.

119
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,583
SALIA: Yes?
May we turn on the viewer?

120
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,875
Yes, of course.

121
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,208
PICARD: Are your
quarters satisfactory?

122
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes. Very.

123
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,750
Tell me, Captain,

124
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,000
who was the young man
I met before?

125
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,750
That was Ensign
Wesley Crusher.

126
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,709
Thank you for checking
on us, Captain.

127
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,375
I only hope our quarters in
Daled 4 will be this luxurious.

128
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,375
Please feel free
to contact me at any time.

129
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,917
Picard out.

130
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,125
TROI: What I sensed
before hasn't changed.

131
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,709
DATA:
What puzzles me, Captain,

132
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,709
is how is she expected to
bring peace to Daled 4?

133
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,208
Its inhabitants
have been fighting

134
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,875
throughout their
recorded history.

135
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:05,834
What do we know about
the cause of these wars?

136
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,000
Only that it is the difference
between night and day.

137
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,291
Data, you used
a colloquialism.

138
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,000
Did I?

139
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,125
What I meant, sir,
is that Daled 4

140
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,208
rotates only once
per revolution.

141
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,667
Therefore, one side
is constantly dark

142
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,875
and the other side
constantly light.

143
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:25,083
One might surmise
that the two hemispheres

144
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,792
have developed
disparate cultures--

145
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:28,875
which is a major cause
of most wars.

146
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,959
(<i> sighs</i> )
And this child

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,083
is supposed to bring
them together.

148
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,125
She seems too delicate
for such a task.

149
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,709
Do not be fooled by her looks.

150
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,125
The body is just a shell.

151
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,208
How can I be a leader
if I don't know

152
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,834
anything about my people?

153
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:52,000
You will lead because you
are accepted by both sides.

154
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,333
And because it is
in your blood.

155
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,125
What is expected of me
once I'm there?

156
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,917
You will know.
How?

157
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,917
You just will.

158
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,125
Salia, you must arrive
with an open mind

159
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,208
without preconceived ideas
of the worlds you will find

160
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,959
or the people
on either side.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,834
It's very frustrating.

162
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,333
You feel the weight of
so much responsibility.

163
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,667
You're not sure
you'll live up

164
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,917
to everyone's
expectations.

165
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,041
It's not only that.

166
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:28,875
Nobody has even asked me if
this is something I want.

167
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,166
It is your duty.

168
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,667
Then I have no choice.

169
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,041
It won't be as bad
as you think.

170
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,834
In fact, it could be
quite wonderful.

171
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,667
Besides...

172
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,208
you are the last
and only chance.

173
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,709
(<i> chittering</i> )

174
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,083
Don't you think I'm going
to need more than instinct

175
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:06,000
to do whatever is expected
of me on Daled 4?

176
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,417
Energy depletion level?

177
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,959
COMPUTER:
.04% and increasing.

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,625
Wesley?

179
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,917
Wesley, you haven't found
that defocused area yet?

180
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,458
I'm looking.

181
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:26,417
Yeah, I see the way
you're looking.

182
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,500
Wesley!

183
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:28,959
What?

184
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,667
Sorry.

185
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,041
I've got my mind
on something.

186
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,375
I can see that.

187
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,917
It's this girl
they beamed up, Geordi.

188
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,792
She's perfect.

189
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:43,625
Absolutely perfect.

190
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,375
Now I understand
why you can't concentrate.

191
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:50,125
I'll do better.
Okay.

192
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,208
I'll do better.

193
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,709
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

194
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,250
COMPUTER: Warning--
resonant field applied.

195
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,667
What is it?
What happened?

196
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:05,875
Uh, nothing, I had it
on the wrong setting.

197
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,375
(<i> sighs</i> )

198
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,125
I suppose it had
to happen to you.

199
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,000
It usually does
about this age.

200
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,875
What usually does?

201
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:16,583
Glands erupting with hormones.
Happens to all of us.

202
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,583
Just because I said that
I think she's interesting...

203
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,834
You said she was perfect.

204
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,333
Uh-uh.
Come on down.

205
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,291
You're no use around
here for now.

206
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,583
Come on down
from there.

207
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,750
Go talk to her.

208
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,250
Use the ladder.

209
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,542
That's silly, Geordi.

210
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,291
But, since you
recommended it,

211
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,750
how should I approach her?

212
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,375
If she'll talk to me,
what should I say?

213
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:47,792
Just say,
"Hi. I'm Wesley Crusher.

214
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:48,834
I'd like to talk to you."

215
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,000
And then what?

216
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,667
Whatever occurs to you.

217
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,083
Well, what if nothing
occurs to me--

218
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,250
Look, Wes, I don't
have time for this.

219
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,542
You're gonna have to
ask somebody else.

220
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,500
Okay.

221
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,000
(<i> screaming</i> )

222
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,500
That is how the
Klingon lures a mate.

223
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,583
Are you telling me
to go yell at Salia?

224
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,083
No.
Men do not roar.

225
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,417
Women roar.

226
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,875
Then they hurl
heavy objects...

227
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:23,875
and claw at you.

228
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,208
WESLEY:
What does the man do?

229
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,208
He reads love poetry.

230
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,583
He ducks a lot.

231
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:38,208
Worf, sounds like it works
great for the Klingons,

232
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,125
but I think I need to try
something a little less...

233
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,000
dangerous.

234
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:47,792
Then go to her door.
Beg like a human.

235
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,041
DATA: It should be
that simple, Wesley.

236
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,542
Judging by her appearance,
it is likely

237
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,083
you and Salia are
biologically compatible.

238
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,375
Of course, there could
be a difference

239
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,959
in the
histocompatibility complex

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,291
of the cell membrane but--

241
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:03,667
Data, I wanna meet her,
not dissect her.

242
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,000
Picard to Salia's quarters.

243
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,208
SALIA:
Yes, Captain?

244
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,959
May I activate the viewscreen?

245
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,583
Hurry. Go, go.

246
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:20,667
Certainly.

247
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,750
We've invited Anya
to take a tour of the ship.

248
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:26,542
Maybe you would
like to join her?

249
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,834
Very much.

250
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,750
Your escort will go
with you shortly.

251
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,333
Picard out.

252
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,208
I think I'll go on the tour.

253
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,041
Why can't I?

254
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,375
(<i> chittering</i> )

255
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:43,166
This is the only chance
I'll ever have

256
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,333
to see a vessel like this.

257
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,709
No.

258
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,208
You must remain here
where it is safe.

259
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:00,291
Salia, do an old woman a favor,

260
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,667
and obey me
for the rest of this trip.

261
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,458
You are no more an old woman
than I am a leader.

262
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,166
(<i> chime</i> )

263
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,583
Yes, come in.

264
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,125
I'm here to escort you
on a tour of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

265
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,250
ANYA:
Salia will remain behind.

266
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,000
I will be
right there.

267
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,792
You are a leader

268
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:25,208
and I am older
than you could ever imagine.

269
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,291
What should I say?
How do-- how do I act?

270
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,875
What do I do?

271
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,583
Guinan, I need your help.

272
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,583
Could you step
over here a minute?

273
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,834
Sounds simple enough.

274
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,208
Now, the first words
out of your mouth

275
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,709
are the most important.
You may wanna start

276
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,709
with something like this.

277
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,500
You are the most beautiful
woman in the galaxy.

278
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:12,625
But that might not work.

279
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:15,000
Yes.
Yes, it would.

280
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,458
You don't know how long
I've wanted to tell you that.

281
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,625
But you were afraid.

282
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:22,792
Yes.
Of me?

283
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,583
Of us, of what
we might become.

284
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,083
Commander...

285
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,000
Or that you might think
that was a line.

286
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,000
Maybe I do think
it's a line.

287
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,709
Then you think
I'm not sincere?

288
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,917
I didn't say that.

289
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,208
There's nothing
wrong with a line.

290
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,208
It's like a knock
at the door.

291
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,792
RIKER:
Then you're inviting me in?

292
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:39,208
GUINAN:
I'm not sending you away.

293
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,500
RIKER:
That's more than I expected.

294
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,291
Is it as much
as you hoped?

295
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,000
To hope is to recognize
the possibility.

296
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,083
I had only dreams.

297
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,375
Dreams can
be dangerous.

298
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:48,625
Not these dreams.

299
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,125
I dream of a galaxy
where your eyes

300
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,917
are the stars and the universe
worships the night.

301
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

302
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:56,834
Careful.

303
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,583
Putting me
on a pedestal so high,

304
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,667
you may not be able
to reach me.

305
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,834
Then I'll learn how to fly.

306
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:07,083
You're the heart in my day,
and the soul in my night.

307
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,125
I don't think
this is my style.

308
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,875
Shut up, kid.

309
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:15,542
Tell me more about my eyes.

310
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:22,083
WORF: This is the
dilithium crystal chamber.

311
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,959
Ah, our chief engineer,
Geordi La Forge.

312
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,291
What is that?
What are you doing?

313
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,750
Nothing to be concerned about.

314
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,792
Just performing some
routine adjustments.

315
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:36,333
I wasn't aware that the
deuterium control conduit

316
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,250
required routine
adjustments.

317
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,458
I perform
periodic inspections

318
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,166
on all engineering systems.

319
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,667
In this case, you seem to
have found a malfunction.

320
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,500
It's not a malfunction.

321
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,625
It's simply that a minute
defocused area is developed.

322
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,417
Lowers our operating
efficiency.

323
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,875
It could also lead to
excess pion production.

324
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:11,583
Our computer
would detect that.

325
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,583
Unless, of course,
it, too, is malfunctioning.

326
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,750
Look, I really have
to get this finished.

327
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:21,959
WORF:
Anya.

328
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,625
Please, come with me.

329
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:34,750
I will be back to
check your progress.

330
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,333
Ensign Crusher,
what can I do for you?

331
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,041
Nothing.

332
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:56,875
Is there a problem?

333
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,500
No.

334
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:04,542
Could you show me how to
work the food dispenser?

335
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,125
Sure.

336
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,542
Really, it's quite simple.

337
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,125
You just tell the
computer what you want

338
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,750
and it prepares
it for you.

339
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,583
Oh.

340
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,208
What should I order?

341
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,333
I don't know.
What do you like?

342
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,959
I'd like something sweet.

343
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,291
I know.

344
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,709
Computer,
Thalian chocolate mousse.

345
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,709
It's a wonderful sensation.

346
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,041
On Thalos 7, they age
the beans 400 years.

347
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,291
You've been there?

348
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,125
It's one of
my favorite places.

349
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,250
Oh, it must be fun to
visit a planet like that.

350
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,667
It's the best part of
being on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

351
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:14,375
I've studied about
some of them.

352
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:17,542
But to see them,
that would be wonderful.

353
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,834
Tell me about some of the
other places you've been.

354
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,250
Oh, there's too many.

355
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,709
The only world I've known
is Klavdia 3.

356
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,166
It's about time
we changed that.

357
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,792
How?

358
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:34,375
Come with me.

359
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,959
PULASKI: I'll be
with you in a moment.

360
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,333
What's wrong with him?

361
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,542
Andronesian encephalitis.

362
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,834
That disease is contagious.

363
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,834
Very unlikely.
Our air filtering system--

364
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,709
But there is a chance.

365
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,000
If you mean mathematically, yes,
the probability is not zero.

366
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,709
I cannot rely on
your primitive technologies.

367
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,083
Kill the patient.

368
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,291
What?

369
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,709
Destroy the patient.
Immediately.

370
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,500
Now, you calm down.

371
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:22,417
If you won't take action,
then I will.

372
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:26,583
(<i> growling</i> )

373
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,458
(<i> gasps</i> )

374
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:35,375
Security to sickbay.
Hurry!

375
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,333
PICARD:
Wait.

376
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,709
Hold your fire.

377
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,667
PICARD:
Worf!

378
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,750
What is she?
Keep her away.

379
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:55,709
Do not interfere.

380
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,500
She wants to kill Hennesey.

381
00:20:57,542 --> 00:21:00,000
His disease
threatens Salia.

382
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,834
Captain, there is
no chance of contagion.

383
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,500
The situation
is under control.

384
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,625
ANYA:
That's not good enough.

385
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,375
But it will have to be.

386
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:16,208
Your powers are infinitesimal
compared to mine.

387
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,709
Yes, that may be.

388
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,583
But you will obey my orders.

389
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,917
You will remain in your quarters
and in your present form

390
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:30,375
for the rest of this voyage.
Is that clear?

391
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,125
Very.

392
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,208
Keep her under guard.

393
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,500
Aye, sir.

394
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,417
WORF:
Wait for me.

395
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,750
What kind of
creature is she?

396
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:47,709
I've never seen
anything like her.

397
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,750
PULASKI: There is
mention in the galactic

398
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:53,041
zoological catalogue of a
species called allasomorph

399
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,458
which is supposed to possess
the power to alter

400
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,333
their molecular structure
into other life-forms.

401
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,583
Such a creature would make
a perfect protector.

402
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:04,959
I want a security team

403
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,709
stationed outside
sickbay, Mr. Worf.

404
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,959
Aye, sir.

405
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,291
Captain, what if
Anya transforms?

406
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,208
Improvise.

407
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:24,208
Can a place so remarkable
truly exist?

408
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,667
Yes.

409
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:27,041
There are many more.

410
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,917
All of them
are different.

411
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:31,000
I've learned about them.

412
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:34,417
That's all I did on
Klavdia 3, was learn.

413
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:38,166
I know so much,
but I've seen so little.

414
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:43,250
Think of all you have
to look forward to.

415
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,625
This is a great
time to be alive.

416
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:47,959
For you.

417
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,083
For both of us.

418
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,709
This is all
just beginning.

419
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,375
We've only charted
19% of our galaxy.

420
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,834
The rest is out there
just waiting.

421
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,166
Look what we've
already discovered.

422
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,834
I have never seen
anything so wondrous.

423
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,375
Wait.

424
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:10,709
Computer, Rosseau 5.

425
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,375
(<i> gasps</i> )
Hey!

426
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,208
It's breathtaking.

427
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,542
Yes.

428
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,792
And you've been
to this place?

429
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,625
Someday, you'll visit
Rosseau 5,

430
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:30,709
and many other places,
all more spectacular.

431
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,333
If only it were possible.

432
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:35,542
Listen.

433
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,959
(<i> ethereal whirring</i> )

434
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,417
What is it?

435
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,417
In a moment,
the harmonic resonance

436
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:47,083
from the neutrino clouds
will become synchronous.

437
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,792
(<i> ethereal whirring</i> )

438
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,083
It's so beautiful.

439
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,458
It's like this place
has a voice.

440
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,625
It's trying to
speak to us.

441
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,834
Thank you for sharing
all of this with me.

442
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:09,041
Someday, you'll see it
all for yourself.

443
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,667
Look over there.

444
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,709
Remain here.

445
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,458
You are restricted
to these quarters

446
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,041
for the remainder
of this voyage.

447
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,875
You are the protector
of this ship, are you not?

448
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:34,959
I'm in charge
of security.

449
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:39,125
You must understand
my duties as well.

450
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:42,792
If you confine me to this cell,
I cannot protect Salia.

451
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:45,250
There is no need
for concern.

452
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,041
She is safe
on this ship.

453
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:51,125
You must understand that I
cannot make such an assumption.

454
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,917
You no longer
have the choice.

455
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,625
You have to trust me
to protect her.

456
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,250
No.

457
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:01,333
A true protector
cannot have two charges.

458
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,625
Your responsibility
is to the ship.

459
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,709
My duty is to Salia.

460
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:10,709
My responsibility to the ship
includes protecting Salia.

461
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,208
You know I'm stronger than you.

462
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,750
I was unprepared.

463
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:20,125
You underestimated me
in your sickbay.

464
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,542
That is usually fatal.

465
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:27,792
Still, you are here,
confined to your room.

466
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,917
I ceased my struggle
by choice,

467
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:32,083
not because of
you or your captain.

468
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:33,375
I would have
stopped you.

469
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:35,583
If not me,
someone else.

470
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:39,709
No, you cannot control me.

471
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,250
We will see.

472
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:54,166
We've obviously brought a very
dangerous life-form on board.

473
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:57,041
I want to minimize the
chance of any incident.

474
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,917
Whatever kind of
life-form Anya is,

475
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:03,709
emotionally, she's
Salia's mother.

476
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,417
(<i> sighs</i> )
The most dangerous animal

477
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,291
is a mother protecting
her young.

478
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,375
Exactly.

479
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:11,083
Captain, this is Anya.

480
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,166
Yes?

481
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:15,125
Salia is gone.
Where is she?

482
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,625
This has all been
so wonderful.

483
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,959
I'm not even
sure it's real.

484
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,291
Believe me, Ten Forward
isn't an illusion.

485
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,000
Not that.

486
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,625
I mean the way I feel.

487
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:33,250
You won't find a better dish
of chocolate anywhere.

488
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:38,250
I'm sure I won't.

489
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,250
Is something wrong?

490
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,083
I've had a great time
being with you, Wesley.

491
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,458
And that makes you sad?

492
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:56,291
When I was on Klavdia 3

493
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,375
all I could think about was
leaving that isolation.

494
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:03,208
What makes me sad is
having to face it again

495
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,125
after seeing what else
is possible.

496
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,417
Is that what awaits
you on Daled 4?

497
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,083
Isolation?

498
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,583
Yes.

499
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,500
I thought you were
going there

500
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:19,000
to reunite two
warring parties.

501
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,625
What else do you know?

502
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,291
Very little.
The ship's computer

503
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,166
doesn't have that much
on Daled 4.

504
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,417
How will you stop
the fighting?

505
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,750
I'm not certain.

506
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:33,125
I only know I will have
many responsibilities

507
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,750
when I get there.

508
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:38,625
Your language has no word
for the position I'll hold.

509
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:40,500
In many ways, I'll have
even less freedom

510
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,792
than I did
on Klavdia 3.

511
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:52,333
You could stay.

512
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,166
On the<i> Enterprise?</i>

513
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,875
Why not?

514
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,041
Because I can't.

515
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,583
Just because
a girl runs out

516
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,500
doesn't mean she doesn't
wish you to follow.

517
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:23,166
What is it?
What happened?

518
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,375
Salia.

519
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,000
Stay away from me.

520
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,458
I'm sorry.

521
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,333
I don't understand.

522
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:38,291
I can't stay here.

523
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,208
I can't have this life.

524
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,250
I want it
more than anything

525
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,208
but I can't have it.

526
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,500
Salia, nothing
is impossible.

527
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,917
Not for you.

528
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:55,500
There's a way.
I know there is.

529
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,583
Leave her alone!

530
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:03,083
Ensign, step
away from her.

531
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,083
ANYA:
Come with me.

532
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:44,500
Energy depletion level.

533
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,333
COMPUTER:
Zero.

534
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:49,834
La Forge to bridge.

535
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,208
PICARD:
Yes, Lieutenant?

536
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,500
I've just completed
my final adjustments.

537
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,875
Thanks for the time.

538
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:56,625
You now have warp
engines available.

539
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:58,250
PICARD:
Very good.

540
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:01,375
Number One, get us to Daled
as quickly as possible.

541
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:04,083
Ensign Gibson,
take us to warp 8.8.

542
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:06,458
Warp 8.8, sir.

543
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,166
Estimated time?

544
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,500
Three hours,
nine minutes.

545
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,667
Ensign Crusher, when you are
finished with your duties

546
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:14,500
in engineering,
report to my ready room.

547
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:15,709
WESLEY:
Yes, sir.

548
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,917
You have the bridge,
Number One.

549
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,333
RIKER:
Aye, sir.

550
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,166
The woman, Anya,

551
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:31,041
is not what she
appears to be.

552
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:35,291
She is an allasomorph.

553
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,834
A shapeshifter?

554
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,291
Yes.

555
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,792
She's not only
a governess,

556
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:45,792
she's also the
girl's protector.

557
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:54,083
Now, I don't care to interfere
in the personal relationships

558
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:57,917
of those under my command.

559
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:02,166
But in this case...

560
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,917
You want me to
stay away from Salia.

561
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:06,041
Yes, I do.
For the good of the ship

562
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:08,750
and the safety of
everyone on board.

563
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,458
I will do as you ask.

564
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:37,333
Why won't you let
me have a friend?

565
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:40,166
It is my duty to protect
you from danger.

566
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,166
There's no danger here.

567
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:45,917
There is always danger from
one who is not your kind.

568
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:48,041
Salia, he's confusing you.

569
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,792
You're forgetting
your responsibilities.

570
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:54,458
Whether or not I see Wesley
is for me to decide.

571
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,959
It is not.

572
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,500
I raised you,
I protected you,

573
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,291
and I intend to deliver you
to Daled 4.

574
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:05,750
Maybe what you want
doesn't matter anymore.

575
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:09,750
Salia, please.

576
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:12,875
I know it's
difficult for you.

577
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:16,625
But you must do what you are
destined to do.

578
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,250
PICARD:
Standard orbit.

579
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,500
Aye, sir.

580
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,959
Hailing frequencies,
Mr. Worf.

581
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,250
Captain, I'm encountering
the same interference

582
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:46,375
we experienced on Klavdia 3.

583
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:49,458
DATA: The troposphere appears
to be distorting our signals.

584
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,417
It is fascinating, Captain.

585
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,458
Klavdia 3 and Daled 4

586
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,750
have almost identical
atmospheres.

587
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:57,417
Magnify.

588
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,166
Times 20.

589
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:08,250
How could anyone exist
in an environment

590
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:10,917
so totally hostile
toward human life?

591
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,875
Mr. Data, do whatever
is necessary

592
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:15,875
to override the interference.
Let's complete our mission.

593
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,000
(<i> chime</i> )

594
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,417
Come in.

595
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,792
Salia.

596
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,542
You shouldn't
have come.

597
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,000
Do you want me to leave?

598
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:33,250
I didn't say that.

599
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:34,667
Then you want me to stay.

600
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:36,250
Does Anya know
you're here?

601
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:38,542
That doesn't matter.

602
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,166
I'm glad you came.

603
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:42,291
I thought Anya would have
kept you with her.

604
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:43,959
I have certain rights.

605
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,792
So, in other words,
you slipped out.

606
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:47,625
While she was asleep.

607
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:51,208
I hope you didn't get in
trouble from your captain.

608
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,375
Oh, I haven't gotten
in trouble yet.

609
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,125
Anya thought you
would corrupt me.

610
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:58,458
With my wild way of life?

611
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:01,500
Maybe...

612
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,291
with the normal
things people do

613
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,458
when they like
each other.

614
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:25,959
(<i> growling</i> )

615
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,041
Wesley, get out
of here now!

616
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,959
What's going on?
Just go, please.

617
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,291
Security, crew quarters.

618
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,291
(<i> growling</i> )

619
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,959
No!
Anya, no!

620
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,375
You should not
have disobeyed me.

621
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:54,083
I had to.

622
00:34:55,417 --> 00:34:57,542
I warned you to
leave her alone.

623
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:08,208
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>stardate 42568.8.</i>

624
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,959
<i>Since Anya's powers</i>
<i>of transformation</i>

625
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,542
<i>apparently gave her the ability</i>
<i>to escape her guards unnoticed,</i>

626
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,917
<i>we have sealed her quarters</i>
<i>with a forcefield</i>

627
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,375
<i>that will contain her</i>

628
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,667
<i>no matter how small a form</i>
<i>she may take.</i>

629
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:23,625
Captain, I'm receiving
an audio signal.

630
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:24,792
Audio on.

631
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:26,291
MAN:
Come in,<i> Enterprise.</i>

632
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,917
This is command headquarters

633
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,000
of Daled four.
We have been expecting you.

634
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,500
Sir, sensors indicate the
communication originated

635
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:34,750
from a terawatt
source on the planet.

636
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:38,208
That's more power than our
entire ship can generate.

637
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,917
It is what is needed to
penetrate the atmosphere.

638
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:44,583
Which means we lack the
ability to respond, sir.

639
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,917
Sir, there are beam-down
coordinates encoded

640
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:48,500
within the carrier signal.

641
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,041
Splendid.

642
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:54,000
I'll arrange
for our guest to beam down.

643
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,458
Forcefield off.

644
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:01,834
(<i> chime</i> )

645
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,709
Come in.

646
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,291
We have arrived.

647
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,125
Salia will be with you
in just a moment.

648
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:17,750
You're not going?

649
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,375
No.

650
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,709
My duties have
been completed.

651
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,667
I have done all that I could.

652
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:29,625
I hope it
was enough.

653
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:33,500
You've raised me well,
and I thank you for that.

654
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:36,917
I would not have
harmed the boy.

655
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:39,333
I only wanted to frighten him.

656
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,125
I know.

657
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,083
You are ready for
what awaits you,

658
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,250
and you will do well.

659
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,417
I know I've been
hard on you.

660
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,041
But I wanted
to prepare you

661
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,583
for anything you might
be required to do.

662
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:57,667
Will I ever be able
to leave Daled 4?

663
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,166
Probably not.

664
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:04,375
But anything
is possible.

665
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:07,208
That's what Wes said.

666
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,208
I hope he's right.

667
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,917
Where will you go?

668
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:14,583
The third moon is within range
of this ship's transporter.

669
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:17,208
I shall go there.

670
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,709
It was my home
before we went away.

671
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:23,625
I'm going to miss you.

672
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:28,667
I know.

673
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:50,542
I am ready now.

674
00:37:57,834 --> 00:38:01,083
I will escort you to
transporter room six.

675
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:07,458
You will be happy
to see me leave.

676
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,792
No.

677
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:11,000
You are
a worthy opponent.

678
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,125
Thank you.

679
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:15,083
At heart, we are
very much alike.

680
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,542
Yes, we are.

681
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:21,917
Perhaps we shall
fight again.

682
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:23,917
On the same side?

683
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:27,750
It would be an honor.

684
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:29,792
Shall we go?

685
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:38,291
(<i> chime</i> )

686
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:39,750
Come in.

687
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:47,667
Wesley, I have to go now.

688
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:53,041
Was it fun?

689
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,417
What do you mean?

690
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:00,959
Playing humanoid.
Was it fun?

691
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,166
Wesley, look at me.

692
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:07,125
Right now, this minute,
this is what I am.

693
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,709
A humanoid girl.

694
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,041
What are you really?

695
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,291
Does it matter?

696
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,166
Yes.

697
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:20,834
Our natural state is one
unlike anything you can imagine.

698
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,125
So, you took this form
for our benefit?

699
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:27,500
That's why you wanted to know
what species we are.

700
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,917
I'm sorry I hurt you.

701
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:31,625
I didn't mean to.

702
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:36,375
I loved you.

703
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,333
I love you, too.

704
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,041
Can you?

705
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,458
Yes!
Oh, yes!

706
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,625
I have the same feelings,
the same emotions as you.

707
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,375
You must believe me.

708
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:53,834
Please go.

709
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:58,709
Wesley, let's not say
good-bye like this.

710
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:24,542
Prepare to beam Salia
to the specified coordinates.

711
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:25,875
Aye, sir.

712
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:27,458
Our world is grateful
for the courtesy

713
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,250
which you have
extended us.

714
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,667
I hope some day
that the Federation

715
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:32,709
and Daled 4 will have
formal contact.

716
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,458
That is my
wish as well.

717
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,000
Coordinates have
been input, sir.

718
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,500
Proceed.

719
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:42,709
Wait.

720
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,709
A taste to remember me by.

721
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:00,458
I wish there was something
I could give you.

722
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,834
You already have.

723
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:06,792
I'm glad you came
to say good-bye.

724
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:09,083
Thank you for everything.

725
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,917
I want you to leave now.

726
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:16,250
Why?

727
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:19,583
I cannot arrive in my
planet in this form,

728
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:22,291
and I want you to
remember me as I am now.

729
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:26,583
Don't worry.
I will.

730
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:58,625
Energize.

731
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:06,875
(<i> sighs</i> )

732
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:15,291
(<i> laughter and conversation</i> )

733
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:48,625
Seeing her on the
transporter pad,

734
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:51,125
it was like
seeing pure light.

735
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:57,458
I miss her.

736
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:02,792
I feel... empty.

737
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:10,208
I know that sensation.

738
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,709
But there'll come
a time when

739
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,208
all you'll remember
is the love.

740
00:43:20,917 --> 00:43:24,417
I'm never gonna feel this
way about anyone else.

741
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,709
You're right.

742
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:34,834
I didn't expect you
to say that.

743
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:39,250
There'll be others.

744
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:43,667
But every time you feel love,
it'll be different.

745
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:46,333
Every time
it's different.

746
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:55,208
Knowing that doesn't make it
any easier.

747
00:43:56,959 --> 00:43:59,375
It's not supposed to.
