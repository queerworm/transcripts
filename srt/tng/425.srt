1
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:06,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44932.3:</i>

2
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:09,875
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is preparing</i>
<i>to enter the Mar Oscura,</i>

3
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,291
<i>an unexplored</i>
<i>dark matter nebula.</i>

4
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:16,417
<i>Commander Data is modifying</i>
<i>several of our photon torpedoes</i>

5
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:19,250
<i>for an experiment designed</i>
<i>to elicit more information</i>

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,250
<i>about this unusual phenomenon.</i>

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,834
The initial dispersal pattern
should not be more

8
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,917
than seven kilometers
in diameter.

9
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:39,792
Jenna?

10
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:43,417
Oh. Uh, 6.8 kilometers.

11
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:45,959
That should suffice.

12
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:48,375
Is there something occupying
your thoughts, Jenna?

13
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,208
You seem somewhat
subdued today.

14
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:54,375
I bumped into Jeff again
in the turbolift this morning.

15
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,375
He asked me
out to dinner.

16
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,542
What was your response?

17
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,792
I told him
I'd think about it.

18
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,291
As you requested,
I will now remind you

19
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,333
of the reasons you decided to
end your relationship with Jeff.

20
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,875
I guess I asked for this.
Go ahead.

21
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,333
You objected to the fact
that he seemed unwilling

22
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,208
to set aside
sufficient time for you.

23
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,917
You said he was
unresponsive,

24
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,959
that he never did
the little things.

25
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,083
You disliked the sound he made
when he ate his soup.

26
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,959
Okay, okay. I remember.

27
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,458
This is the third time
I have refreshed your memory.

28
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,125
Do you wish to rescind
our agreement?

29
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,041
No. No, it's
for my own good.

30
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,792
It's just so easy
to forget.

31
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:46,041
Hand me the sequencer.

32
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,417
Throughout history,

33
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:50,000
many lovers have suffered
the same difficulty.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,417
Anne Boleyn was quite distressed
that Henry the VIII

35
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:54,959
preferred the company of his
huntsmen over that of his wife.

36
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,625
Since when did you
develop an interest

37
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,792
in romantic
historical figures?

38
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:03,041
Six weeks ago, when you and Jeff
dissolved your relationship,

39
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:06,834
I saw an excellent opportunity
to study that aspect
of human intimacy.

40
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,125
As your friend,
it is my responsibility

41
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,291
to be supportive
in times of need.

42
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,083
That's, uh...

43
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,333
that's very sweet, Data.

44
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,291
Data to Bridge.

45
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,500
We are ready to begin
the first illumination test.

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,667
Acknowledged.

47
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,500
All science stations stand by.

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,709
We're about to light up
the nebula. Mr. Worf?

49
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,333
Launch Bay One
shows ready, Commander.

50
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,041
Fire torpedo.

51
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,625
Jenna:
It's beautiful.

52
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,417
Like watching fireworks
when I was a little girl.

53
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,041
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

54
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:30,291
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

55
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,500
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,500
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

57
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,417
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

58
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:44,917
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

59
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:47,375
(<i> playing Reicha's "Woodwind</i>
<i>Quintet in E-flat major"</i> )

60
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,000
That was wonderful.
Really?

61
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,959
Really. Wonderful.

62
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,041
Thanks.

63
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:47,959
Is something wrong?

64
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:50,166
My tempo was way off.

65
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:53,083
I felt like I was rushing
through the whole piece.

66
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,834
I do not believe
that is so.

67
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:57,083
Your rhythmic control
has improved markedly.

68
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,625
I heard no fluctuations
during the performance.

69
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,959
Well, maybe,
but I ruined the coda.

70
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,166
I got confused
with the phrasing again.

71
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,583
I kept breathing
at the wrong times.

72
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:11,417
The contrapuntal nature of the
composition is most demanding.

73
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:13,667
We will give more attention
to the rhythmic patterns

74
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,375
during our next rehearsal.

75
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,333
However, I am quite certain

76
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,917
the audience was oblivious
to such nuances.

77
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:22,875
They seemed to enjoy
the performance thoroughly.

78
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,375
Thank you, Data.

79
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,959
You're very generous.

80
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,291
KEIKO:
Every night, Miles leaves
his socks on the floor.

81
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,875
When we got married,

82
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,417
I made the mistake of
picking them up a few times.

83
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,750
Then I realized,
if I kept it up,

84
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,792
I'd be doing it
for the rest of my life.

85
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,458
So I stopped,

86
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,667
figuring he'd get the point
and do it himself.

87
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,583
One night goes by...

88
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,125
two... a week...

89
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,125
ten days.

90
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,333
By now there's a pile of socks
half a meter high.

91
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,250
Oh, come on,
it wasn't half a meter.

92
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,959
After two weeks,
I couldn't stand it anymore.

93
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,792
I bundled them up and put them
in the cleaning processor.

94
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,834
And I'm still doing it.

95
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:08,959
And a very good job
she does of it, too.

96
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,000
Keiko, you sound
just like Data.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,875
He came over to my quarters
the other day to give me
a music lesson

98
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,917
and he said
the funniest thing.

99
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,583
How did you put it?

100
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,166
About the mess?

101
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,583
I believe I observed

102
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,417
that you seem to have
an aversion to orderliness.

103
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:29,583
But it was not intended
as a humorous remark.

104
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,750
So, before we started,

105
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,041
he gallantly offered
to help me straighten up.

106
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,709
And a very good job
I did of it, too.

107
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,375
Report, Mr. Data.

108
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,208
I have nearly finished
compiling readings

109
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,250
of our most recent
illuminatory burst.

110
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,250
Dark matter density

111
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,625
is nearly one order of
magnitude higher

112
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,667
than in similar nebulae.

113
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:04,959
Life-forms may have developed
in ways never before observed.

114
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,041
Interesting hypothesis.

115
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,959
Are there any M Class planets
we can check out?
Several, sir.

116
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,750
The nearest is approximately
three light-hours from
our present position.

117
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,333
It's worth a look.

118
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,333
We'll continue
our survey along the way.

119
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,458
Let's increase the flow rate
and see if that helps.

120
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,583
(<i> metallic clink</i> )

121
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,041
Sometimes in the summer,
we'd go on cookouts--

122
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:54,542
just my little brother
and me and my mother.

123
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:57,166
She was hopeless
without a replicator,

124
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,834
we didn't care.

125
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,583
Children often
do not develop

126
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,208
discerning palettes until
well beyond adolescence.

127
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,625
It wasn't that.

128
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,834
It's just that we felt
so good being together,

129
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,667
you know, as a family.

130
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:13,291
We didn't have much of that
after my father died,

131
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,166
so those times
were really special.

132
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,667
I wish we were
back there now, you and I.

133
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:23,333
The unidirectional nature
of the time continuum

134
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,542
makes that
an unlikely possibility.

135
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,000
That's what I love about you,
Data, you make me laugh.

136
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,041
I don't know why I keep falling
for the wrong men.

137
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,291
Why can't I fall for
somebody like you?

138
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,875
You're perfect.
That is not true.

139
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,667
I have no human feelings.

140
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:45,000
But you give me so much.

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,041
You spend time with me
when I'm lonely.

142
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,792
You encourage me
when I'm down.

143
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:54,458
No man has ever
been kinder to me.

144
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,083
Those are the things
that matter.

145
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:04,959
I better be going.

146
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,959
With your permission,
Commander.

147
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,208
Permission granted.

148
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,500
I don't know
if you're aware of this,

149
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,417
but you're very handsome.

150
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,250
I'll see you tomorrow.

151
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,083
Hello, Data.

152
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,875
Would you like
to try something new?

153
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,375
It's a concoction
I heard about on Prakal II.

154
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,375
I think it's wonderful,
but I need a second opinion.

155
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:24,000
87% Saurian brandy.

156
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,250
Targ milk and Denevian mead
comprise the rest.

157
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,542
There is an unusually
high concentration

158
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,625
of fructose compound
and monosaccharides.

159
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,917
Too sweet?

160
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,000
Data, if I didn't
know you better,

161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,834
I would say you were
a little... preoccupied.

162
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,792
Lieutenant D'Sora
just gave me

163
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,667
what could be considered
a very passionate kiss

164
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,375
in the Torpedo Bay.

165
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,959
Really?

166
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,625
And...

167
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,250
I was intrigued.

168
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,750
Jenna seemed to be displaying
genuine affection for me.

169
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,000
Well...

170
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,500
what do you think
of her, Data?

171
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,417
I find her to be
a competent officer,

172
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,166
highly motivated,

173
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,458
though, somewhat lacking
in her understanding

174
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,750
of the theory underlying

175
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,750
the dilithium matrix
application.

176
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,667
I meant personally.

177
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,458
I look forward to the time
we spend together.

178
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,083
Well, then it seems
the next move is yours.

179
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,500
What are you going to do?

180
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,125
I do not know.

181
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,583
I have no experience
in such matters.

182
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,792
I require advice.

183
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:51,166
Don't look at me.

184
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,291
No, no, Data.

185
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,333
I simply mean

186
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,125
that I can't give you
any advice here.

187
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,709
It's not good to advise people
about their first love affairs.

188
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,000
That's kind of something
people have to figure out
for themselves.

189
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,959
But I am not capable of love.

190
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,542
Then it's going to be
a very unique experience.

191
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,250
Data?

192
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,959
Missing someone?

193
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,333
I found Spot wandering
through the corridor

194
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,792
two sections away.

195
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,291
Thank you.

196
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,000
Forget to secure
the door when you left?

197
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,750
The door sensor
is programmed

198
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,333
to recognize only humanoid forms
per entrance and egress.

199
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,291
Spot could not have
triggered the mechanism.

200
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,125
Maybe somebody came in
while you were away.

201
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,083
Let him out
by accident.

202
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,041
Has anything
been disturbed?

203
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,500
It does not
appear so.

204
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,834
Computer, has anyone
been in my quarters

205
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,667
in the last 12 hours other than
Commander La Forge or myself?

206
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,417
COMPUTER:
Negative.

207
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:02,583
That's pretty strange.

208
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,500
You know, to be on the safe
side, maybe I should report

209
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,125
a possible unauthorized
entry to Security.

210
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:12,333
Geordi, may I ask
your advice...

211
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,333
in a personal matter?

212
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,083
Sure, Data.

213
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,250
Should I pursue a relationship
with Lieutenant D'Sora?

214
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,166
I thought she
and Jeff Arton...

215
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,458
They have discontinued
their association.

216
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,583
She has made
the first move in initiating

217
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,458
a relationship with me.

218
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,166
What should I do?

219
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

220
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,917
Boy.

221
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:38,959
If she's just coming out
of a bad situation...

222
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,917
you know, sometimes

223
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:44,750
it takes people a while, Data.

224
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,208
But then, if they jump right
into another relationship...

225
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,667
you see that can be trouble.

226
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,625
Unless, of course,
she's really ready and then...

227
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,208
well, I guess it
depends on whether or not

228
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:57,125
you're really serious.

229
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,333
This can be
a little complicated.

230
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,417
Listen, my advice is...

231
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,417
ask somebody else
for advice.

232
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:06,834
At least someone
who's got more experience

233
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:09,500
at giving advice.

234
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:16,083
I think you should be careful.

235
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:20,125
This isn't just some experiment
you're running, Data.

236
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,458
Jenna is a living,
breathing person

237
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,250
with needs and feelings
that have to be considered.

238
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,917
Then you do not believe I should
pursue this any further.

239
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:30,125
I didn't say that.

240
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,166
I just want you to be aware

241
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,917
that this is
unlike any other

242
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:36,959
more casual relationship
that you've attempted.

243
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,333
I have studied
much human literature

244
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,375
on the subject of love
and romantic liaisons.

245
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,375
There are many role models
for me to emulate.

246
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:48,792
Ultimately, Jenna will
care for you for who you are,

247
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:51,000
not what you imitate
out of a book.

248
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,834
My programming may be
inadequate to the task.

249
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:58,333
We're all more than the sum
of our parts, Data.

250
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,208
You'll have to be more

251
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,458
than the sum
of your programming.

252
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:09,333
Klingons do not
pursue relationships.

253
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,834
They conquer that
which they desire.

254
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,417
However...

255
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:21,166
Lieutenant D'Sora
serves under my command.

256
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,166
If she were mistreated,

257
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,750
I would be
very displeased...

258
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,834
sir.

259
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:37,000
I understand.

260
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,250
I think you should pursue it.

261
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,208
First of all,
she's a beautiful woman.

262
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,959
She seems to be
crazy about you.

263
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,875
Jenna has clearly demonstrated
how she feels about me,

264
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,250
but I am not capable
of returning those feelings.

265
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,500
Data...

266
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,375
when you get involved
with another person,

267
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,250
there are always risks--

268
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,083
of disappointment,
of getting hurt.

269
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,333
I cannot be hurt,
but she can.

270
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,083
Jenna knows that

271
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,375
and she has obviously decided
to take the chance.

272
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,583
Data, when it really works
between two people,

273
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,208
it's not like anything
you've ever experienced.

274
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:16,625
The rewards are far greater
than simple friendship.

275
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,750
How far, sir?

276
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,792
That's what I'm hoping
you're going to find out.

277
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,000
Captain?

278
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,333
I am seeking advice
in how to...

279
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,458
Yes, I've heard, Data.

280
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,917
And I will be delighted
to offer any advice I can

281
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:40,041
on understanding women.

282
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,333
When I have some,
I'll let you know.

283
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,166
<i>Second Officer's</i>
<i>Personal Log,</i>

284
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,083
<i>Stardate 44935.6:</i>

285
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,250
<i>After conferring</i>
<i>with my colleagues</i>

286
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,875
<i>regarding the nature</i>
<i>of romantic love in general,</i>

287
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,125
<i>and my own situation</i>
<i>in particular,</i>

288
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,458
<i>I have reached a decision.</i>

289
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,917
Oh, they're lovely.

290
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:09,583
Come in.

291
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,417
What are they?
A variety of crystilia.

292
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:16,583
Their fragrance is
an evolutionary response

293
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,625
to the acrid nature of the
atmosphere on Telemarius IV.

294
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,291
You silver-tongued devil.

295
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:27,166
Um, why don't I find
a place to put these...

296
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,917
which won't be that easy.

297
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:32,250
Ah.

298
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,291
It seems your quarters
have reverted

299
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,291
to their earlier state
of disorder.

300
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,875
I know. I'm hopeless.

301
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,333
There.

302
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,875
They're beautiful, Data.

303
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,625
It's really sweet of you.

304
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,417
Commander Riker suggested
this particular flower.

305
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,959
He said it had worked
for him in the past.

306
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,375
You didn't talk
to the entire ship about us?

307
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,792
No. In actuality,
less than one percent

308
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:59,208
of the<i> Enterprise</i> crew
was involved.

309
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,583
Huh.

310
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,542
It was necessary
to balance theory

311
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:06,834
with experiential
referents.

312
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:10,667
Both are required for
a program of this nature.

313
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,250
Computer,
decrease illumination level

314
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,667
by one-third standard lux.

315
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:26,083
Uh, this is all part
of a program?

316
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,917
Yes, one which I just created
for romantic relationships.

317
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:34,625
So I'm, uh,
I'm just a small variable

318
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,417
in one of your new
computational environments?

319
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:40,500
You are much more
than that, Jenna.

320
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,333
I have written a subroutine
specifically for you--

321
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,375
a program
within the program.

322
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,041
I have devoted a considerable
share of my internal resources

323
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,125
to its development.

324
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,333
Data...

325
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,625
that's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

326
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,208
Estimated time
of arrival, Mr. Data.

327
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,834
We will reach
the Class M planet

328
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,041
in approximately
11 hours, sir.

329
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,875
You have the Bridge,
Number One.

330
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,917
Picard to Lieutenant Worf.

331
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:46,458
Yes, Captain.

332
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,542
PICARD: Would you step into
my ready room, please?

333
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:51,041
And bring a tricorder
with you.

334
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,083
Aye, Captain.

335
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,125
Captain?

336
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,792
What do you make of this?

337
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,458
I am puzzled, sir.
So am I, Mr. Worf.

338
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,125
The only detectable bioelectric
residuals are your own.

339
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,792
You did not...
No, I did not.

340
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:20,875
Well, perhaps we have
a poltergeist.

341
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,709
Sir?

342
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,500
A mischievous spirit.

343
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,625
Sir.

344
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,917
Perhaps not.

345
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,709
I cannot explain how
an intruder entered this room.

346
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:39,083
But I recommend
we go to red alert.
Not yet.

347
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,875
Then I will order one of
my officers to stand watch.

348
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,875
Worf to Ensign--
That's all right,
Mr. Worf.

349
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,959
I think, for now,
circumstances

350
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:48,250
warrant caution,
nothing more.

351
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,250
As you wish, Captain.

352
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,667
(<i> door chimes</i> )

353
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:11,417
Enter.

354
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,000
I know it's
a little unexpected.

355
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,542
You are correct.

356
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:21,375
I did not anticipate
your arrival until 1900 hours.

357
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,458
Well, I couldn't wait.

358
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:27,333
Um, I wanted you
to have this.

359
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,917
You have often expressed
dissatisfaction

360
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:35,000
with the spartan nature
of my quarters.

361
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,917
Is this an attempt
at embellishment?

362
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:40,291
The cat's out of the bag.

363
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,625
Spot?

364
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,917
No, I mean you've
caught me in the act.

365
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:47,959
I'm just trying to brighten
things up around here.

366
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:50,291
It's Tyrinean.

367
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,166
What do you think?

368
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,792
Its line is both fluid
and formal,

369
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,959
yet retains
an unpremeditated quality.

370
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,375
The tactility of its surface
embellishment is evocative

371
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,500
of the neo-primitive period
in Tyrinean blade carving.

372
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,709
Um, I hadn't thought of it
in that way.

373
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,917
I'm sorry.
Don't let me interrupt.

374
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:16,625
As you wish.

375
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:27,208
Uh, Data?
Yes?

376
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:31,375
The book of love,
chapter four, paragraph 17--

377
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,792
when your girlfriend
arrives with a gift,

378
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:37,250
stop whatever it is
you're doing

379
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,166
and give her your
undivided attention.

380
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,792
I should not have resumed
my painting.

381
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:46,792
No.

382
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:50,000
Despite your suggestion
that I continue.

383
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,083
Exactly.

384
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,375
I have much to learn.

385
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:01,500
Um, why don't we start
with this?

386
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,041
A critical analysis
isn't necessarily

387
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,208
the best response
to a gift.

388
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:12,375
Perhaps if I looked for
a suitable place to display it.

389
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,417
Much better.

390
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,834
The ambient light
in this location

391
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:28,709
accentuates its contours.

392
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,792
However...

393
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,041
a gift should not
necessarily be placed

394
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,333
according to
aesthetic criteria.

395
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:42,083
A more central location

396
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,542
would give added meaning.

397
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:48,125
Data, what's important
is that you're trying.

398
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:51,125
You don't know how much
that means to me.

399
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,291
Why don't you go back
to your painting?

400
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,750
Oh, I really mean it
this time.

401
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,041
I'll see you tonight.

402
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,792
RIKER:
Riker to Captain Picard.

403
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,709
I think you'd better
come out here, sir.

404
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,625
Acknowledged.

405
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:43,458
We've reached
the designated coordinates,

406
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,875
but the M Class planet...

407
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,542
it's gone.

408
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,542
Are you sure there was
no malfunction in the sensors?

409
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,917
The lateral E-M scanners
register radiation levels

410
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:07,625
indicative of
a Class M planet.

411
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,500
Sir...

412
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,625
Mr. Data, run a full
systems diagnostic.

413
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,291
COMPUTER: Warning--
atmospheric decompression

414
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,000
in Bridge
observation lounge.

415
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,750
Environmental compensation
sequence has been initiated.

416
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,875
I am not registering
a hull breach.

417
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:31,458
Scan for life-forms.
None, sir.

418
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,542
Captain,
standard air pressure

419
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,667
has been reestablished
in the observation lounge.

420
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,208
Let's have a look.
Mr. Data?

421
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:48,250
Captain.

422
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:56,333
WORF:
I do not understand.

423
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,333
Are you picking
anything up, Data?

424
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,166
I detect no unusual readings
along standard parameters.

425
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,834
Curious.

426
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:06,959
The transparent aluminum
alloy of this window

427
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,625
is exhibiting a pattern

428
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,041
of transient
electrical currents.

429
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,583
Explanation.
I have none.

430
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:16,333
The rate is characteristic
of a subspace distortion,

431
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,959
but I am picking up no evidence
of a subspace field.

432
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:20,458
We'll hold position

433
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,875
while we seek an explanation
of these anomalies.

434
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:26,041
Let's divert all
our resources to that end.

435
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,959
Honey, I'm home.

436
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:47,208
Hi.
Hi.

437
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,917
Any luck with
your diagnostic?

438
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:54,000
Negative.
We found no malfunctions.

439
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,125
We did a full
security sweep.

440
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,000
Nothing.

441
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:05,333
May I...

442
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,542
get you a drink, dear?

443
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,709
Well, yes.

444
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:12,041
I'll... I'll have
a Calaman sherry.

445
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,750
Excellent choice.

446
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,291
I'll join you.

447
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:23,125
Computer, two...

448
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,959
Calaman sherries.

449
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,417
Would you care for
some dinner as well?

450
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:40,458
Oh, I'm too tired to
think about what I want.

451
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,834
Maybe later.

452
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:44,250
Whatever you wish, dear.

453
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,709
There we are.

454
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:52,417
Uh-uh...

455
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:54,834
Darling,

456
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:58,417
you remain
as aesthetically pleasing

457
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:01,000
as the first day we met.

458
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,792
I believe I am
the most fortunate sentient

459
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:06,959
in this sector
of the galaxy.

460
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:18,208
You...

461
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,166
relax...

462
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,583
put your feet up...

463
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,959
and I will take care
of everything.

464
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:41,166
(<i> singing aria from</i> La Boheme )

465
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:00,834
I could organize
your closets for you.

466
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:03,375
I have found
that by grouping apparel,

467
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:06,458
first by function, then by
color, from light to dark,

468
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:09,583
one can more easily find
one's desired choice.

469
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:13,166
Uh, Data...
that's all right.

470
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,917
You don't have to do that.

471
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:16,542
But I am happy to do it.

472
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:19,208
Please, just put them down.

473
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:21,458
(<i> shoes dropping</i> )

474
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:24,166
What do you wish me to do, dear?

475
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,542
Am I not paying
enough attention to you?

476
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,834
Oh, no, that's not it, um...

477
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:31,959
Perhaps I am not giving you
enough compliments.

478
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,583
Your hair...

479
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,792
is looking particularly
silky tonight.

480
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:43,709
Data, there's just
something strange

481
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,041
about the way
you're acting.

482
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:48,458
Am I not behaving
as a solicitous mate?

483
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:50,834
Well, yes, but...

484
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:52,792
Tending to
your every need?

485
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:55,792
What's wrong
with you tonight?

486
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:00,542
My most recent self-diagnostic
revealed no malfunctions.

487
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:08,250
Perhaps there is something
wrong with<i> you!</i>

488
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,875
I've never seen you
behave so foolishly.

489
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,458
Why are you doing this?

490
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:16,125
You don't tell me how to behave.
You're not my mother!

491
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,583
What?

492
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,083
You are not my mother.

493
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,500
That is the appropriate
response for your statement

494
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,041
that I am behaving foolishly.

495
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:27,000
Data, I think you
should just leave.

496
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,792
You do not wish to continue
our lovers' quarrel?

497
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:33,959
Is that what this is?

498
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:37,375
In my study of
interpersonal dynamics,

499
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,625
I have found that conflict,

500
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,542
followed by emotional release

501
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:44,250
often strengthens the connection
between two people.

502
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,834
But there's
something so forced

503
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:52,291
and artificial about the way
you're doing it, Data.

504
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:55,417
It's just not
the real you.

505
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:59,083
With regard to
romantic relationships,

506
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,709
there is no real me.

507
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:05,250
I am drawing upon various
cultural and literary sources

508
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,917
to help define my role.

509
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,917
Kiss me.

510
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:22,917
What were you
just thinking?

511
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:24,875
In that particular moment,

512
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,875
I was reconfiguring
the warp field parameters,

513
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:30,667
analyzing the collective works
of Charles Dickens,

514
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,500
calculating
the maximum pressure

515
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,291
I could safely apply
to your lips,

516
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:37,500
considering a food
supplement for Spot...

517
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,125
I'm glad I was
in there somewhere.

518
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,792
A complete sensor scan
of the planet

519
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:57,291
and three survey probes
came up with no surprises.

520
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,542
No signs of life.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

521
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:02,667
Seven more unusual incidents
have been reported.

522
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,458
No casualties or damage.

523
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:06,625
We can only state
that a subspace effect

524
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:08,625
seems to exist
within this nebula.

525
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,417
After I have made further
analysis,

526
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:12,834
I may be able to adjust
the ship's sensors to locate

527
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:14,500
and identify the anomaly.

528
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,375
RIKER: The ship's at risk
as long as we're sitting here.

529
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:19,417
We could continue
the investigation
outside the nebula.

530
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:21,125
Agreed.

531
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,875
Ensign McKnight, plot the most
direct course ahead warp one.

532
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,458
Aye, sir.
Engage.

533

DATA:
Captain...

534
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:39,333
Captain, explosive
decompression on Deck 37.

535
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:42,000
Bridge to La Forge.
Damage report.

536
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,792
We're showing damage
between decks.

537
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:46,041
We haven't localized it yet.

538
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,917
(<i> moaning</i> )

539
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:54,125
Thorne, are you all right?
Yes, sir.

540
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:55,625
La Forge to Bridge.

541
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,834
A cryogenic control conduit
just blew out on us.

542
00:33:57,834 --> 00:34:00,125
I almost lost a man.

543
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,625
Ensign, full stop.

544
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,208
Aye, sir.

545
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,333
LA FORGE: La Forge to Bridge.
Go ahead, Commander.

546
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:09,542
LA FORGE:
I think we have some structural
damage between Decks 36 and 37.

547
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:11,166
I'd better go check it out.

548
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:18,125
Van Mayter,
you take access tube 23 M

549
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,792
and look at those
Bridge connectors.

550
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:21,375
Thorne, I'll cover
the aft section.

551
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,625
You go down...

552
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,375
(<i> woman screams</i> )

553
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:45,917
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental:</i>

554
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,500
<i>This series of</i>
<i>unexplained events</i>

555
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,000
<i>has now resulted</i>
<i>in the death of a crewman.</i>

556
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,458
<i>But it appears Mr. Data</i>
<i>may have an explanation.</i>

557
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,375
DATA:
During the last occurrence,

558
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:58,083
I was able to confirm
one of my hypotheses.

559
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:02,917
The unusual preponderance
of dark matter in this nebula

560
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:06,750
is causing small gaps
in the fabric of normal space.

561
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,291
As the<i> Enterprise</i> moves
through this nebula,

562
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:11,458
it is colliding
with these deformations.

563
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,291
So every time
we hit one,

564
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:16,959
part of the ship momentarily
phases out of normal space.

565
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,959
Or when one of them hits us.

566
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:22,333
My readings suggest that
the deformations are in motion.

567
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:23,875
It's a good thing
one of those pockets

568
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,792
didn't pass through
the photon torpedo casings.

569
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,625
Or one of the matter/anti-matter
containment pods.

570
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,792
The question is
how do we get out?

571
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:32,250
Mr. Data, could you
reconfigure the sensors

572
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,875
so as to detect
these anomalies?

573
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,750
Yes, sir, but only
at extremely close range.

574
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,000
Even at minimal speed,
it would be impossible

575
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,792
to maneuver the<i> Enterprise</i> 
quickly enough to avoid them.

576
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:44,625
A shuttlecraft is
more maneuverable.

577
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,375
He's right.

578
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,625
If we could position
the shuttlecraft

579
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,959
far enough in front
of the<i> Enterprise,</i>

580
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:54,667
it could detect the pockets
and allow us enough time to
maneuver out of the way.

581
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:57,166
We could give the shuttle
control of our navigational
systems.

582
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:59,041
That way
the corresponding maneuvers

583
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,458
would be virtually
instantaneous.

584
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,583
Make it so.

585
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,750
RIKER:
I'll do my pre-flight
once I'm on board.

586
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,917
Not this time, Will.
I want you on the Bridge.

587
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,875
Sir?

588
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:17,041
I'm going to pilot
the shuttle.

589
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,000
Captain, it is my duty
as First Officer

590
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,041
to safeguard the lives
on this ship, including yours.

591
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,709
The<i> Enterprise</i> can't
afford to lose you,

592
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:25,250
certainly not
in this situation.

593
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,500
I believe our best chance of
escaping this situation

594
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,542
is for me to pilot
the shuttle.

595
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:31,125
It's my ship, Will.

596
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:33,166
I've got to do this.

597
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,667
Sir.

598
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,250
Shuttle three to<i> Enterprise.</i>

599
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,917
Telemetry link enabled.

DATA:
Ship's computer is accepting

601
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:56,125
navigational inputs
from the shuttle.

602
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,583
Forward sensors are online.

603
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,041
Ensign McKnight,
plot a course

604
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,041
for the shortest distance
out of the nebula.

605
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,750
McKNIGHT:
Plot laid in, sir.

606
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,792
Outer perimeter
at 32 million kilometers.

607
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,583
PICARD:
Point one impulse, Number One.

608
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:11,250
Acknowledged, Captain,
We're right behind you.

609
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:14,250
Riker to O'Brien, lock on to
the Captain's communicator.

610
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,208
I want to be able to pull him
out of there in case we have to.

611
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:17,709
Aye, sir.

612
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,208
Changing course.

613
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:31,041
New heading, 299.029.

614
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:36,917
Main coupling is matching
navigational inputs, Captain.

615
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:38,500
New heading confirmed.

616
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,542
I missed it by less than
1,000 meters,<i> Enterprise.</i>

617
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,041
Advise your status.

618
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:46,542
Sensors indicate deformation
passing 500 meters

619
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:47,959
off the starboard bow.

620
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,875
One down, Captain.

621
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,083
Resuming previous course.

622
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,709
McKNIGHT:
Confirmed.

623
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:56,583
Outer perimeter now at
30.1 million kilometers.

624
00:37:56,583 --> 00:38:01,250
Changing course.
Heading 073.288.

625
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:07,834
New heading, 284.01--

626
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,542
<i>Enterprise,</i> 
I'm losing maneuverability.

627
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:17,750
Sensors indicate damage
to the shuttle's

628
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,792
starboard impulse nacelle.

629
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:23,250
I'm re-routing the secondary
deuterium supply.

630
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,000
Switching to manual control.

631
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,375
Transceiver signal
is down 42%.

632
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,709
Navigational inputs
are not registering.

633
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,417
We've lost our link, Captain.

634
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:34,375
You'll have to make course
changes manually

635
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:36,417
until we reestablish
the connection.

636
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:39,500
Understood.
Mr. Data, get us back online.

Geordi, boosting
the power to the L-U bands.

638
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,458
McKnight,
increase the distance

639
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,291
between the<i> Enterprise</i> 
and the shuttle.

640
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:48,166
We're going to need some more
room to make manual adjustments.

641
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,166
New heading, 299.18.

642
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,834
McKNIGHT: Yes, sir, I've got it.
Course corrected.

643
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:01,166
<i>Enterprise,</i> hard starboard!

644
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:03,000

WORF: Reports coming in.
Minimal damage.

649
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:16,208
Mr. La Forge,

650
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:18,375
I'm still having difficulty
controlling the shuttlecraft.

651
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:21,041
LA FORGE: Aye, sir.
Your krellide storage cells
are losing their charge.

652
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:23,792
Maintaining manual
control is going to become
increasingly difficult.

653
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:26,083
Estimated distance
to the nebula's perimeter?

654
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:28,625
DATA:
4.7 million kilometers, sir.

655
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:31,959
Is there a way to transfer
the microfusion thrusters
so I can get a power boost?

656
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:33,458
DATA:
Possibly.

657
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,083
If you augment
the thruster sequencing

658
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,500
so that the inertial
dampening fields...

659
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,291
Relative bearing 27...
make that 285.255.

660
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:47,333
Commander, the shuttle
is out of control.

661
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,458
Mr. O'Brien, do you have
the Captain's signal?

662
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:52,333
O'Brien: I'm having trouble
locking on, sir.

663
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,542
Sir, the shuttle's inertial
dampeners have failed.

664
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,291
It is breaking up.

665
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,041
Let's get him out of there.

666
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:03,083
Now would be a good time,
Mr. O'Brien.

667
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:10,750
Did we get him back?

668
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,792
O'BRIEN:
Aye, sir, we got him.

669
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:16,375
PICARD:
I'm a little dizzy, Number One,
but none the worse.

670
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,542
I'm on my way.

671
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,125
Acknowledged, sir.

672
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,291
Commander, we are
nearing the perimeter.

673
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:24,041
One million kilometers away.

674
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:26,458
All right,
let's make a run for it.

675
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,000
McKNIGHT:
Aye, sir.

676
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:43,375
We're clear of
the nebula, sir.

677
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:46,709
Ensign, plot a course
for Starbase 260. Warp two.

678
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:48,250
Aye, sir.

679
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,000
Engage.

680
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

681
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:10,250
Enter.

682
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,667
Hi.

683
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:13,208
Hi.

684
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:16,458
The place looks great.

685
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,166
Thank you.

686
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:20,583
It is much less spartan,
is it not?

687
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,375
Much less.

688
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:24,166
It looks great.

689
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:26,500
It really does.

690
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,000
It looks... great.

691
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,917
Jenna, you are
repeating yourself.

692
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:35,083
I have often found this
to be indicative

693
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,583
of a mental distraction.

694
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:39,625
Is that a correct assumption
in this instance?

695
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:42,417
Um, I'm afraid it is.

696
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,625
Then perhaps we should
begin our meal.

697
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:47,834
Among humans, a low serum
glucose level is...

698
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:51,208
Data, I think
we should talk.

699
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,166
Could you sit down?

700
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:03,250
Um...

701
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,959
I'm not sure how to begin.

702
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:07,959
What is the subject?

703
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,583
You and I.

704
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:11,959
Our relationship.
Yes?

705
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:18,959
Data, sometimes
people blindly make

706
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:21,667
the same mistake
again and again.

707
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:25,083
Are you currently experiencing
this phenomenon?

708
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:29,417
I didn't see it until today.

709
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:32,041
I got out of a relationship

710
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:35,709
with an unemotional man

711
00:42:35,709 --> 00:42:38,625
and I got right back
into another one...

712
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,709
with...

713
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:46,667
with a man who's absolutely
incapable of emotion.

714
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:50,750
Hmm... there does appear
to be a recurring motif.

715
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:55,667
You were so kind
and attentive.

716
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:58,333
I thought that
would be enough.

717
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,709
Is it not?

718
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:04,417
No, it's not.

719
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:08,041
Because as close
as we are, I...

720
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:10,583
I don't really matter to you.

721
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,875
Not really.

722
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:16,208
Nothing I can say or do
will ever make you happy

723
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:19,041
or sad...

724
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:22,333
or touch you in any way.

725
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,750
That is a valid projection.

726
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,250
It is apparent that my reach
has exceeded my grasp

727
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,959
in this particular area.

728
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:32,417
I am, perhaps,
not nearly so human

729
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:34,417
as I aspire to become.

730
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:37,542
If you are ready to eat,
I will bring our meal.

731
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:40,542
Uh... no.

732
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:42,667
That's all right, Data.

733
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,875
I'm going to go now.

734
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:47,667
As you wish.

735
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:54,250
Jenna...

736
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,583
are we no longer...

737
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,166
a couple?

738
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:03,375
No, we're not.

739
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:06,500
Then I will delete
the appropriate program.

740
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:13,667
I'll see you later.

741
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:25,000
Hello, Spot.
