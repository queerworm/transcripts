00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:17,625
(<i> groaning</i> )

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,583
(<i> door opens</i> )

3
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,250
Number One, will
you join me in
the Ready Room?

4
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,709
Yes, sir.

5
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:39,208
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

6
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:43,500
I've just come from a meeting
with Admiral Moore.

7
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:46,875
He wanted to discuss this.

8
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:51,083
(<i> electronic pulsing</i> )

9
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,625
Recognize it?

10
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:56,583
Sounds like it might be
an SOS.

11
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,834
Good guess.

12
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,709
You're quicker
than Starbase Research.

13
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,041
It took them hours to determine
that this was a distress beacon.

14
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,625
When was it detected?
Last month.

15
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,250
It just kicked in
without any warning.

16
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,500
Who used the beacon?

17
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:15,417
It's Terran.

18
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,125
Captain, I'm familiar with
most Earth codes, and...

19
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,625
Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:19,917
Interesting.

21
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:24,166
Yes, that code hasn't been
used in centuries.

22
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,291
What was its
origin point?

23
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,000
Ficus Sector.

24
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,291
Captain, I don't think
there's any record

25
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,250
of an Earth colony
in that area.

26
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,667
Well, now we know
there's someone out there

27
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,875
and they're
asking for help.

28
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,333
But who?

29
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,291
Let's try and find out.

30
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,083
Computer, download
all information

31
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,959
regarding signal beacon
from Starbase mainframe.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,834
COMPUTER:
Distress beacon used
by the European Hegemony.

33
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,125
The European Hegemony?

34
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:58,375
A loose alliance formed in the
early part of the 22nd century.

35
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:00,834
It was the first
stirrings

36
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,208
of world government.

37
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,750
You should read more history,
Number One.

38
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,333
Computer, locate
the exact dates

39
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,333
in which this signal beacon
was in general use.

40
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:13,000
Old Earth calendar
2123 until 2190.

41
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,250
No extraterrestrial source
ever used this code?

42
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,458
COMPUTER:
Negative.

43
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,583
Computer, locate all Earth
deep space launches

44
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:25,375
from 2123 until 2190

45
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:29,125
with the destination in
or near the Ficus Sector.

46
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,750
Working.

47
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:37,709
Nothing for Ficus.

48
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,500
Damn it, who's out there?

49
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:46,291
Lost sheep.

50
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,083
Let's go see if we
can find them.

51
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,500
Medical emergency.

52
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,208
Dr. Pulaski to the Bridge.

53
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,417
PICARD:
What happened?

54
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,500
He just
collapsed, sir.

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,834
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

56
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:31,041
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

57
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,667

<i>for the cause of his collapse.</i>

68
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,458
I am fine.

69
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,083
You're not fine.
You fainted.

70
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,125
I did not faint.

71
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,333
Klingons
do not faint.

72
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,208
Excuse me, I'll rephrase.

73
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,834
<i>This</i> Klingon suffered
a dramatic drop

74
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,041
in blood pressure.

75
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,333
His blood glucose
level dropped.

76
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,375
There was deficient blood flow

77
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:19,083
resulting
from circulatory failure.

78
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,792
In other words,
he curled up his toes

79
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:26,083
and lay unconscious
on the floor.

80
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,208
Doctor, there is no
need to insult me.

81
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,500
Worf, I'm worried.

82
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,291
Now, something is wrong.

83
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,750
Klingons don't faint.

84
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:36,917
(<i> growls</i> )

85
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,291
Forgive me.

86
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,417
I just can't think
of another word that applies.

87
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,542
You're sick.

88
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,333
Klingons do not give in to...

89
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,375
Just stay
right where you are.

90
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:49,041
I have to check something
with the computer.

91
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:02,583
Lieutenant, you have<i> rop'ngor.</i>

92
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,792
But that is a
childhood ailment.

93
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,709
Yes.

94
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,375
How shall I live down
the humiliation?

95
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,542
Oh, Worf, you can't help...

96
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,709
Still, for a warrior

97
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,792
to find himself
in such a situation.

98
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:24,500
So you've got the Klingon
version of the measles.

99
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:27,709
How would Commander Riker feel
if he had the measles?

100
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,083
Pretty silly.

101
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,583
PICARD:
Dr. Pulaski, how is
Lieutenant Worf?

102
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,333
He's in no danger.

103
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,542
Uh, Worf was, um...

104
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,291
just observing
a Klingon ritual

105
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,250
involving fasting

106
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,667
and he didn't take into account

107
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:47,041
that you have to decrease
your physical activity

108
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,125
as you decrease
your caloric intake.

109
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,750
Pulaski out.

110
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,500
Thank you.

111
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:57,792
I am in your debt.

112
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,375
(<i> deep exhale</i> )

113
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:03,500
(<i> door chime</i> )

114
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:05,208
Come.

115
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,000
Captain, I've been considering
the problem of the missing ship.

116
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,000
Although there is no record
of a launch

117
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,000
to the Ficus Sector--
which would not be unusual

118
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,750
considering the chaos
of the early 22nd century--

119
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:18,250
someone had to load that ship.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,667
The manifest.

121
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,333
Yes, sir.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,875
There it is.

123
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:35,291
SS<i> Mariposa.</i>

124
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,542
Loaded 27th of November 2123.

125
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,709
Destination Ficus Sector.

126
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,000
Captain Walter Granger,
commanding.

127
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,792
<i>Mariposa:</i> the Spanish word
for butterfly.

128
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,208
Thank you, Data.

129
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,375
I thought it might be
significant, sir.

130
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,375
It doesn't appear to be, Data.

131
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:53,750
No, sir.

132
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,875
You learn a lot about people
from their luggage--

133
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:59,959
225 Yoshimitsu computers,
five monitor beacon satellites

134
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,417
700 cellular com links,
fifty spinning wheels...

135
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,583
Spinning wheels?

136
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,709
Cattle...
Accessing.

137
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,375
chickens,
pigs...

138
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:09,125
A device used for spinning yarn
or thread, which consists

139
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,333
of a large hand
or foot-driven
wheel and once...

140
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,834
Why would anyone carry
such an insane mix of cargo?

141
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,291
Data!

142
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:19,375
Perhaps they were planning
for the worst, sir.

143
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,500
Theorize, Data.

144
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:25,125
Give me some background.

145
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,291
In the early
22nd century

146
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,625
Earth was recovering
from World War III.

147
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,375
A major philosopher of the time
was Liam Dieghan

148
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:34,291
founder
of the Neo-Transcendentalists

149
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,834
who advocated a return
to a simpler life

150
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,041
in which one lived
in harmony with nature

151
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,750
and learned
under her gentle tutelage.

152
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:44,125
Thank you, Data.

153
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,542
But if this was a ship
full of utopians

154
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,625
why carry all this
technological baggage?

155
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,291
I have insufficient
information

156
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,041
upon which to form
a cogent theory, sir.

157
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,917
Doctor.

158
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:18,792
I wish to thank you
for protecting my...

159
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,834
Your secret
is safe with me.

160
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:26,417
Worf, I'm honored.

161
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:32,458
No one has ever performed
the Klingon tea ceremony for me.

162
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,625
There, that
should do it.

163
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,500
You know the ceremony.

164
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:54,667
I understand the externals,
not the mysteries.

165
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:55,917
I'm not a Klingon.

166
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,917
You must not drink the tea.

167
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,875
It is deadly to humans.

168
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,834
And none too good for Klingons.

169
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,542
It is a test of bravery,
of one's ability

170
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,875
to look at the face
of mortality.

171
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:08,166
It is also a reminder

172
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,667
that death is
an experience best shared

173
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,000
like the tea.

174
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,250
Worf, you're a romantic.

175
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,375
It is among the Klingons

176
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:22,333
that love poetry
achieves its fullest flower.

177
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,041
Hold that thought.

178
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,333
Antidote.

179
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:39,041
If we're going to share,
let's share.

180
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,291
Now, quote me a little

181
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,333
of that poetry.

182
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,417
PICARD:
Initiate sensor sweeps.

183
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,250
Aye, sir.

184
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,333
The system's sun
has entered a period

185
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,917
of severe
flare activity.

186
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,792
Now we know what
triggered the SOS.

187
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:15,917
Class-M readings

188
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,333
from the fifth planet
in the system.

189
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,041
Take us in.

190
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,959
WORF:
Shields
at maximum.

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,125
Sensors indicate
human life-form readings

192
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,166
30 meters below
the planet's surface.

193
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,375
Hailing on all frequencies.

194
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,000
No response so far

195
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,750
but the flares may be
interfering with communications.

196
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:49,875
There is no evidence

197
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,458
of an advanced
communication network.

198
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,333
They brought a lot
of technology.

199
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,875
Where is it?

200
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:59,834
There is no artificial
power source on the planet.

201
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,000
The stellar flares
are increasing

202
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,959
in magnitude and frequency.

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,291
Computer projections indicate

204
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,333
they will brush the planet
in 3.6 hours.

205
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,166
Evacuation will be difficult.

206
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,792
We can lower our shields
for transport

207
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,458
only between the flares.

208
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,583
Captain, these people have
been isolated for 300 years.

209
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,000
They could be very
unsophisticated.

210
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,792
The shock of being suddenly
transported onto a space ship

211
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,959
could frighten them,
to say the least.

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,625
Mm. Your point is well-taken,
Counselor.

213
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:32,875
Number One, you're going
to have to go down there.

214
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:34,625
On my way.

215
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:44,875
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>stardate 42827.3.</i>

216
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,125
<i>Commander Riker</i>
<i>has reached the caverns</i>

217
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:51,458
<i>where he's making preparations</i>
<i>to begin the evacuation.</i>

218
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,542
What's the situation,
Number One?

219
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,125
RIKER:
There are roughly
200 people down here.

220
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,291
Their condition?

221
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,917
Surprisingly good.

222
00:12:58,959 --> 00:12:59,917
Are they willing to leave?

223
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes, but...

224
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,917
Well, get them up here.

225
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,291
I'm having a little debate
with the colony's leader.

226
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,291
It seems...

227
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,875
There's no time, Number One.

228
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:07,959
Initiate the transport.

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,375
But, sir...

230
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,792
Whatever the problem,
we'll handle it up here.

231
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,375
Aye, aye, sir.

232
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,834
We're on our way, all of us.

233
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,125
Riker out.

234
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,375
RIKER:
First load ready, Mr. O'Brien.

235
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:20,959
Energizing.

236
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,041
(<i> sheep baaing</i> )

237
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,333
(<i> rooster crowing</i> )

238
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,709
Captain

239
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,333
you'd better get somebody
down here, right away.

240
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:44,166
(<i> sheep baaing,</i>
<i>rooster crowing over com</i> )

241
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,208
(<i> pig squealing</i> )

242
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,917
MAN:
Down you go, my beauty.

243
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,125
Down you go.

244
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,125
Take the pig out there,
will you?

245
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,959
Very good, very good.

246
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,792
O'Brien, I think that third wave
should be in position.

247
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:16,208
Shoo, damn you.
Shoo, shoo.

248
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,333
Aye, sir.

249
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,417
(<i> loud commotion,</i>
<i>chicken clucking</i> )

250
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,250
O'Brien, is it, hmm?

251
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,291
I should have known

252
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,333
'twould be
a good Irishman

253
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,709
who was running
this ship.

254
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,000
(<i> clears throat</i> )

255
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,625
What the devil is going
on here, Number One?

256
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,250
Ah, Captain Picard, is it?

257
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,875
Oh, the man who makes
decisions for me and mine

258
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:57,458
without so much
as a by-your-leave.

259
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,709
This is my Security
Chief, Lieutenant Worf.

260
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:06,333
I don't suppose security
is much of a problem for you.

261
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:11,583
Danilo Odell, sir,
at your service.

262
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,834
What are these animals
doing here, Number One?

263
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,417
I'm sorry, sir.

264
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,333
It was either this or arguing
until hell froze over.

265
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,208
Uh, Captain
Picard, sir...

266
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,250
we can't leave
our animals here to die.

267
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:27,166
Besides, how could we build
our future without our animals?

268
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,375
All right.

269
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:32,417
Chief O'Brien,
transport this group

270
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,917
directly to Cargo Hold 7

271
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,417
and beam the remaining
refugees from the planet

272
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,458
directly to that hold.

273
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,125
Yes, sir.

274
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,250
Right, lads, everybody back
onto the infernal machine.

275
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,625
All right, everybody up here.

276
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,667
Uh, Captain, Captain.

277
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,041
'Twas very good of you, sir

278
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,208
to rescue us
from our troubles.

279
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,250
My pleasure.

280
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,709
Yes. Uh, sir.

281
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,083
You must be
worth quite a bit

282
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,125
to own a fine
ship like this.

283
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,875
I don't own
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

284
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:57,917
I command her.

285
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,250
Oh, whatever.

286
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,709
Ah, sir, would you happen
to be married?

287
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,709
No. Why?

288
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,000
No?

289
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,625
Well, you see, sir,
I have a daughter.

290
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,917
Felicitations.

291
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,917
Would you be
interested, sir?

292
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,458
No.
You're quite sure?

293
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,667
Quite sure.

294
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,333
Um, he's quite sure.

295
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,750
What's the total?

296
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,125
Two hundred
and twenty-three.

297
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,041
Count on two more
in the next few days.

298
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,000
Set course for
the nearest Starbase.

299
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,041
You know, they were
anachronistic in 2123.

300
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,500
It will be interesting
to see how they cope.

301
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,583
They'll learn and adapt.

302
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,166
If Danilo Odell
is any indication

303
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,000
they'll be running this place
inside of a week.

304
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,208
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

305
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,625
Lieutenant Worf here, report.

306
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,709
MAN:
Fire in Cargo Hold 7.

307
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,417
The Bringloidi.

308
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,542
What have they done
to my ship now?

309
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,750
Keep the area clear.

310
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,709
Report.

311
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,125
The fire has
been contained.

312
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,208
No damage.

313
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,583
Unseal the doors.

314
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:16,000
My God, Picard, the place
is a bloody deathtrap.

315
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,208
Lightening bolts falling
from the ceiling.

316
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,583
DANILO:
What the hell was that thing?

317
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,291
WORF:
Automated fire system.

318
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,375
A force field
contains the flame

319
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:32,375
until the remaining
oxygen has been consumed.

320
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:35,625
Ah, wh-wh-what if I'd
been under that thing?

321
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,333
You would have been
standing in the fire.

322
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,333
Yeah, well, leaving that aside
for the moment--

323
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,875
I mean, what would have
happened to me?

324
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:44,542
You would have
suffocated and died.

325
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,458
Ah, sweet mercy.

326
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,750
Oh, there you are.

327
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,750
Your hospitality

328
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,667
leaves a hell of a
lot to be desired.

329
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,250
You don't offer us
a bite or a sup

330
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,166
and when we build a fire
to cook a little something

331
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,583
the whole
place goes mad.

332
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,834
I, um...

333
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,000
My apologies.

334
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,417
I was unaware

335
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:05,417
that you had not been
instructed in the use

336
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,291
of the food
dispensers.

337
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,542
And what are you staring at?

338
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,458
Have you never
seen a woman before?

339
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
I thought I had.

340
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,250
DANILO:
Uh, Commander.

341
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:21,917
May I present my
daughter, Brenna Odell.

342
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:24,208
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

343
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,083
You may have all
the time in the world

344
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,250
but I have dozens of
frightened and hungry

345
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,000
children and women
to look after.

346
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,375
And what about the men?

347
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,375
Well, I'm sure they'll
find their comfort

348
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:36,625
as they always do--

349
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:38,750
in the bottom of a
mug of home brew.

350
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:41,041
(<i> chuckling</i> )

351
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,125
Pay no heed, Commander.

352
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,959
She's a fine girl.

353
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,333
She's not usually
as sharp-tongued as that.

354
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,000
BRENNA:
Dado!

355
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,917
Sir?

356
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:00,083
That's the last
thing I expected.

357
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,500
Sometimes, Number One

358
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,125
you just have to...
bow to the absurd.

359
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:13,792
Ah, Captain.

360
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:14,834
Captain, sir.

361
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,917
How did the ship
sense the fire?

362
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:20,875
Uh, well,
the ship's computers...

363
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,333
Com-pu-ter?

364
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,166
The ship's computers sense
a localized increase...

365
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,625
BRENNA:
Men, always talking

366
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,792
when there's work to be done.

367
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,417
And shouldn't you
be flying this ship

368
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,875
or whatever it is you do?

369
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,083
Shh.

370
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,208
Sir, I think I'll stay
and give her some help.

371
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,041
That isn't necessary.

372
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,917
The ship will clean itself.

373
00:19:55,959 --> 00:20:00,625
Well, good for the bloody ship.

374
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,709
Tell me,
Commander Riker

375
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,625
where does a girl go
to wash her feet on this ship?

376
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,500
As the First Officer

377
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,375
I feel it's
my responsibility

378
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:49,792
to show you
all the amenities.

379
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,792
She is very much
like a Klingon woman.

380
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:03,709
Uh, Captain,
just one other thing.

381
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,417
It slipped my mind
in all the hustle and bustle.

382
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,417
The point,
Mr. Odell?

383
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,792
Yes, well, in all your travels

384
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:16,083
have you heard anything
from the other colony?

385
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,250
The<i> other</i> colony?

386
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,458
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

387
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,625
<i>A review of stellar charts</i>
<i>has revealed a Class-M planet</i>

388
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:31,542
<i>only half a light year</i>
<i>from the Bringloid system.</i>

389
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,125
<i>I'm proceeding on the premise</i>

390
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,083
<i>that it was the destination</i>
<i>of the colony</i>

391
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,333
<i>which possessed the more</i>
<i>sophisticated equipment.</i>

392
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:46,417
William Riker,
you're a mess.

393
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,875
Oh, you don't have to do that.

394
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:50,083
And if I don't,
who will?

395
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,875
I can see why your father
wants to marry you off.

396
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:56,500
Oh, and why is that?

397
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:58,750
So he can have a pipe
and a mug of beer in peace.

398
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:06,542
You've shown me so many
wonders on your great ship

399
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,083
but there's still one thing
you haven't shown me.

400
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,750
What's that?

401
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:15,875
I'm still waiting
to wash my feet.

402
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,500
Right behind that door.

403
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,291
William, is something wrong?

404
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,208
What do
you mean?

405
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,166
Do you not like girls?

406
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,375
Of course I do.

407
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:40,041
Oh, is there a special technique
to this foot washing?

408
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,834
You generally
start at the top

409
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:48,458
and work
your way down.

410
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,166
I think I can handle that.

411
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,417
I was hoping you might.

412
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:17,542
(<i> people talking, sheep baaing)</i>

413
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,333
WORF:
You sent for me?

414
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,709
Ah, yes, yes.

415
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,625
Now, we're brewing poteen

416
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:32,417
but we need to find
a way to heat it

417
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:38,041
without this bloody ship firing
bloody lightening bolts at us.

418
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,709
You can obtain
spirituous liquors

419
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,125
from the food dispensers.

420
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,083
Huh-uh, oh, no, no.

421
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,417
It's not that synthehol bilge
that O'Brien offered me, is it?

422
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,709
No.

423
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,375
If you wish
it can be real alcohol.

424
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:51,750
Good.

425
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:55,000
With all the deleterious
effects intact.

426
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,792
As it should be.

427
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,333
You see, lad

428
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,000
every moment of pleasure in life

429
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:06,375
has to be purchased
by an equal moment of pain.

430
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:12,000
Whiskey.

431
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:23,709
Terrible.

432
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,583
It has no bite.

433
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:31,250
<i>Chech'tluth.</i>

434
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:44,583
(<i> wheezing</i> )

435
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:49,208
Now that's what I call
a wee drop of the creature.

436
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,667
Father!

437
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:54,125
Remember what I said
about the moment of pain?

438
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,834
Well, 'tis about to begin.

439
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,750
(<i> wheezing</i> ):
Hello, my darling.

440
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,166
Oh, "my darling," is it?

441
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,458
I might
have known.

442
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,125
Are you drunk yet

443
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,333
or can you talk with Dr. Pulaski
about the children?

444
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,667
What about them?

445
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:15,417
She wants to send them to school
with the ship's children.

446
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:18,083
What do you think?

447
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,333
I think it's a good idea.

448
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,500
So go handle it.

449
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:31,542
And I'm sure there's something
you can be doing with your time.

450
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:34,208
And as for you...

451
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,583
What?

452
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:38,208
Why did you have to tell them
this magic wall

453
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,041
can give them more
than meat and potatoes?

454
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:41,709
Now we'll never get
a lick of work out of them.

455
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,250
Madam, have you ever considered

456
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,041
a career
in security?

457
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,709
If it's anything like
baby-sitting, I'm an authority.

458
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,125

462
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:05,375
Signal from the planet, Captain.

463
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:08,458
On screen.

464
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,667
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the USS<i> Enterprise</i>

465
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:15,041
representing the United
Federation of Planets.

466
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,709
This is wonderful.

467
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,166
Welcome, Captain.

468
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm Wilson Granger
Prime Minister of Mariposa.

469
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:24,917
No doubt, a descendant
of Captain Walter Granger.

470
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,834
Not quite a descendant.

471
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,166
We feared Earth had suffered
some catastrophe

472
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:31,375
when no one came back
to check on us.

473
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:35,917
I'm afraid the truth is,
you got lost in the bureaucracy.

474
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:38,000
But despite the lateness
of our arrival

475
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:42,041
we're here now,
and we're eager to renew ties.

476
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,709
Splendid.

477
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,667
Please come down and allow us

478
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:48,583
to extend our hospitality
to you and your crew.

479
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:49,959
Thank you.

480
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,792
Form an away team, Number One.

481
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:54,417
I would urge caution.

482
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:55,750
Caution? What's wrong?

483
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:58,375
He's hiding something.
We'll check it out.

484
00:26:58,417 --> 00:26:59,834
Mr. Worf.

485
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,875
Dr. Pulaski, join us
in Transporter Room 3

486
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:03,291
for an away detail.

487
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,500
Welcome to Mariposa.

488
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:17,709
I am Victor Granger,
Minister of Health.

William Riker

490
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,375
Dr. Pulaski,
Lieutenant Worf.

491
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:22,750
A pleasure.

492
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:24,250
I'll escort you
to the Prime Minister.

493
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,750
This way, please.

494
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:27,125
Twin brothers?

495
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:30,417
GRANGER:
Your arrival really
is serendipitous.

496
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:32,333
PULASKI:
Oh, how so?

497
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:36,625
well, uh, perhaps I'll let
the Prime Minister explain that.

498
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,333
Triplets?

499
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:48,125
Worf, there is something
damn odd going on here.

500
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,959
Quadruplets.

501
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,583
Doctor, is your title
scientific or medical?

502
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,709
Medical.
Ah, excellent.

503
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,750
Is there some
medical problem we
should know about?

504
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:10,208
I think it best
if the, uh...

505
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,000
Prime Minister
explains that.

506
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:13,291
Somehow, I thought
you might.

507
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,333
Yes, excuse me.

508
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,458
Gentlemen?

509
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,250
Please follow me.

510
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:23,041
(<i> whirring softly</i> )

511
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,959
This way please.

512
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,917
Doctor?

513
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,792
Welcome to Mariposa.

514
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:46,709
Dr. Katherine Pulaski.

515
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,041
This is my Chief of Staff,
Elizabeth Vallis.

516
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,291
Tell me, is your
entire population

517
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:55,000
made up of clones,
Prime Minister?

518
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,208
Clones?

519
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,041
Clones?

520
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,959
Clones.

<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

522

<i>has requested an urgent meeting</i>

Captain, we need your help.

526
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:25,000
300 years ago,
during our landing on Mariposa

527
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:28,000
the skin of our ship
was breached.

528
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:31,125
Only five of the colonists
survived.

529
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:36,125
The progenitors weren't willing
to just give up and die

530
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,083
and they were scientists...

531
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:42,500
PICARD:
So they used their expertise
and turned to cloning.

532
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:46,792
Yes, we had no other option.

533
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:48,375
Two women and three men

534
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,041
represented
an insufficient gene pool

535
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,208
from which to build a society.

536
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,875
Well, how did
you suppress

537
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,917
the natural sexual drive?

538
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,792
Drugs?
Punitive laws?

539
00:29:57,834 --> 00:30:01,250
In the beginning,
a little bit of each.

540
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:03,959
Now, after 300 years

541
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,625
the entire concept
of sexual reproduction

542
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:09,375
is a little repugnant to us.

543
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:11,583
How did you
overcome

544
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:14,500
the problem
of replicative fading?

545
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:16,417
We haven't.

546
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:19,542
You have got a problem.

547
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:22,667
Wait, I don't understand
"replicative fading."

548
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:26,417
Each time you clone,
you're making a copy of a copy.

549
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,750
Subtle errors creep
into the chromosomes

550
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:31,125
and eventually you end up
with a non-viable clone.

551
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:33,041
How can we help you?

552
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,583
We need an infusion
of fresh DNA.

553
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,625
I was hoping
that you would be willing

554
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:40,291
to share some
tissue samples.

555
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,750
You want to clone us?

556
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:46,500
Yes.

557
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:49,250
No way.
Not me.

558
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:52,542
But how could you possibly
be harmed?

559
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:54,500
It's not a question of harm.

560
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:58,875
One William Riker is unique,
perhaps even special

561
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,750
but a hundred of him,
a thousand of him

562
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,750
diminishes me
in ways I can't even imagine.

563
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:06,375
You would be
preserving yourself.

564
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:09,750
Human beings have other ways
of doing that.

565
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:11,500
We have children.

566
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,250
I think you will find
that attitude prevalent

567
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:28,834
among all
the<i> Enterprise</i> people.

568
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:32,083
I see.

569
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:37,834
Well, if you are not willing
to share your DNA

570
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,917
will you at least
send some people

571
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,375
to repair
our malfunctioning equipment?

572
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:42,834
Yes, of course.

573
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:44,458
Number One,
put a technical team together.

574
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,250
Let's get these repairs
underway.

575
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:47,667
Yes, sir.

576
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:51,125
Lieutenant La Forge

577
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:53,709
prepare a technical
support away team.

578
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,917
Meet me in
Transporter Room 3.

579
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,792
Captain, with your permission

580
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,583
I would like to return
to the planet.

581
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,625
It could be my last opportunity
to study replicative fading.

582
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:04,834
With your permission, of course,
Mr. Prime Minister.

583
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,583
You would be
most welcome.

584
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,500
Perhaps you will
find a solution that
we have overlooked.

585
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:11,875
Well, I appreciate
the compliment

586
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:14,333
but I don't think
that's very likely.

587
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:17,000
And repairing that equipment

588
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,834
will certainly not
solve your problems.

589
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,917
What other solution
do we have?

590
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:27,542
Doctor, remember, there
are only five of us.

591
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,041
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

592
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:41,166
<i>Commander Riker and Dr. Pulaski</i>
<i>have returned to Mariposa</i>

593
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:44,125
<i>with a team</i>
<i>of</i> Enterprise<i> technicians.</i>

594
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,792
The repairs are
almost complete.

595
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,125
I wish there was
something more
we could do.

596
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:54,000
Are you sure
you won't reconsider?

597
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,959
About the cloning?
Yes.

598
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,291
Out of the
question.

599
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,750
Excuse me, sir,
I was, uh...

600
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:18,417
I was looking
for Commander Riker.

601
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,792
I'm afraid I haven't seen him.

602
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:21,834
Dr. Pulaski?

603
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,709
Sorry, I can't help you.

604
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,208
Well, I guess
I'll just have to hunt for them.

605
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,250
Sorry to disturb you.

606
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,875
Hey, so what happened to
you two down on Mariposa?

607
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:09,333
Is everything all right?

608
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:11,542
Is there any reason
it shouldn't be?

609
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,917
Yeah, every time I
asked where you were

610
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:14,250
some clone
lied to me.

611
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,959
Lied to you?

612
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,542
Commander, with this, I can see
better than your average person.

613
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,083
Now, when someone lies

614
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,542
there are certain
physiological manifestations--

615
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,667
variations in
blush response

616
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:26,959
pupil dilation,
pulse, breath rate.

617
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,583
Doesn't always work with aliens,
but humans--

618
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:29,834
I got them nailed.

619
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,333
The clones lied
about our whereabouts?

620
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:32,500
Mm-hmm.

621
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:34,166
I don't remember
anything happening.

622
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:35,917
I was working
in their medical facility

623
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:38,000
and got a call to report
to Granger's office.

624
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,875
I ran into Will
on the way and...

625
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:41,458
Now, wait a minute.

626
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,959
Granger said that he hadn't seen
either one of you.

627
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,333
Now, did you make it
to his office?

628
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,709
I think...

629
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,041
I don't remember.

630
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,834
So, what's the
prognosis, Doc?

631
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:04,583
Geordi, you'll be
pleased to know

632
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,583
that you're not missing
any epithelial cells.

633
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:07,667
Great.

634
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:09,709
Will and I, however<i> are.</i>

635
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,375
Meaning?

636
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:14,041
Although you can clone
from any cell in the body

637
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,792
the cells lining the stomach
are the best choice

638
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:20,625
because they're relatively
undifferentiated.

639
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,125
LA FORGE:
Where you going?

640
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,792
To their cloning lab.

641
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,750
GRANGER:
Stop!

642
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:41,625
Murderers.

643
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:42,709
Like hell.

644
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,750
You're a damn thief.

645
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:44,792
Gentlemen, please.

646
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:46,166
What else
could we do?

647
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,583
We asked for your help
and you refused us.

648
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,583
We're desperate!
Desperate!

649
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,375
And that gave you the right
to assault us?

650
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:54,500
To rob us at...

651
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:56,625
We have the right to survive.

652
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:14,417
Doctor, how desperate
is the colony's situation?

653
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,125
Well, they've got
two or three generations

654
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:18,000
and then the fading
will be terminal.

655
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:20,000
They're among
the walking dead now.

656
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:21,375
They just haven't been buried.

657
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:23,834
RIKER:
I want the cloning
equipment inspected.

658
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,458
Who knows how many other
tissue samples were stolen.

659
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,792
We certainly have a right

660
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:29,333
to exercise control
over our own bodies.

661
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:31,625
You'll get no argument from me.

662
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:34,792
I know the Mariposan culture
seems alien

663
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:36,125
even frightening

664
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,458
but, really,
we do have much in common.

665
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,875
They're human beings
fighting for survival.

666
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:43,250
Would we do any less?

667
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,875
Are you saying
we should give them

668
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:46,417
the DNA samples they require?

669
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:49,041
That's just postponing
the inevitable.

670
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:52,709
If they get an infusion
of fresh DNA, in 15 generations

671
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,917
they'll just go back
to the same problems.

672
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:57,834
Cloning isn't the answer.

673
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:01,125
What they need
is breeding stock.

674
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:07,125
The Bringloidi.

675
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,125
Yes.

676
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:10,291
They have the energy
and drive

677
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:13,083
and the clones possess
the emotional maturity

678
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,500
and the technical knowledge.

679
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,291
They started out together.

680
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:20,500
It seems only fitting
they should end up together.

681
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,583
It's a match made in heaven.

682
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:25,542
Unfortunately, it will have
to be a shotgun wedding.

683
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,792
I'm sorry, Captain,
it's out of the question.

684
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,709
You're trying to dump
your problems on us.

685
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,125
We have problems
of our own.

686
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,875
Don't you understand?

687
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:52,667
The Bringloidi can help you.

688
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:54,166
Look at him.

689
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,875
How could we ever integrate<i> that</i>
into our society?

690
00:38:57,917 --> 00:39:00,000
You're no prize
yourself.

691
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:03,500
Primitive,
hostile, disruptive.

692
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,041
It would require
enormous effort

693
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,667
to even educate them.

694
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:09,333
Oh, forget it,
Captain Picard.

695
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:11,375
I'm not going to come in here
with my hat in my hand

696
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:14,333
begging charity
from this blatherskite.

697
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,667
Now stop!

698
00:39:15,709 --> 00:39:18,417
I will not allow
posturing and bigotry

699
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,458
to destroy this meeting.

700
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,834
Now, please, sit down.

701
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:32,500
Now, Commander Riker
has asked

702
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,417
that your laboratories
be inspected

703
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:35,875
for stolen
tissue samples

704
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:38,083
and I understand
his concern.

705
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,625
We may have to transport
all your equipment here

706
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:41,792
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

707
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,709
I see.

708
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,333
When reason fails,
you'll resort to blackmail.

709
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:50,959
Fine, destroy yourselves.

710
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,792
PULASKI:
It's not so bad, Captain.

711
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:55,250
In 50 years, we'll have
a new Class-M planet

712
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:58,792
complete with cities
and ready for colonization.

713
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:06,875
You see, the end is closer
than you like to think.

714
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I don't know.
There are so many difficulties.

715
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,458
Look, man...

716
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,417
we are decent,
hard-working people.

717
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:23,000
We're willing to learn.

718
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:25,959
They're so different.

719
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,041
It is the differences
that have made us strong.

720
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:34,333
For 300 years, we have denied
the carnal side of our nature.

721
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:37,208
How can we learn
to put that aside?

722
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,542
Well...

723
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:42,458
you, you, you put
a young couple together

724
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,542
and you let nature
take its course.

725
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,083
Now, if this is going to work

726
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,792
you're going to have
to alter your society, too.

727
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:53,166
Monogamous marriage
will not be possible

728
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,917
for several generations.

729
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:58,709
I don't quite understand.

730
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,208
30 couples are enough to create
a viable genetic base

731
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,542
but the broader the base

732
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:06,375
the healthier,
and the safer the society.

733
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:08,500
So, it would be best
if each woman--

734
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:11,166
Bringloidi
and Mariposan--

735
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:12,625
had at least
three children

736
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:15,500
by three
different men.

737
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:20,959
I... I think I could
handle that, yes.

738
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:27,333
Oh, God, it's so...

739
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,041
Frightening?

740
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:31,208
Repugnant.

741
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:35,500
So it's a done deal?

742
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:39,458
And here is
my hand on it.

743
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,625
Ho-ho-ho!

744
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:48,917
Right, well, now let's go

745
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:51,166
and stake out
my three women.

746
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,291
Send in the clones.

747
00:41:56,709 --> 00:41:59,917
I must be out of my mind.

748
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:02,542
Starfleet will probably
agree with you.

749
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:08,542
Ah, excuse me,
sir, Captain.

750
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,667
Thank you, sir.

751
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:11,834
Brenna... Brenna....

752
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,917
Hmm?
A word.

753
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,792
(<i> men laughing</i> )

754
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,125
Isn't that just
like a man!

755
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:00,000
You make these
grandiose decisions

756
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:01,625
but you never stop to
consider the poor women.

757
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,041
Miss Odell, I...

758
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,375
You men draw a mug, and
solve all the problems

759
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,875
of the world while
the beer goes down

760
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,875
but when it comes
to the practical matters

761
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:11,709
it always falls to the women

762
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,041
to make your grand dreams
come true.

763
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:17,792
Miss Odell, you were the one
who wanted a new home.

764
00:43:17,834 --> 00:43:20,250
But I don't know
if I want to be Eve.

765
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:24,792
It's your choice.

766
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,291
If you wish, you can stay
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

767
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:29,166
We will drop you off
at a Starbase.

768
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,625
Then you can go where you wish.

769
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:34,000
Leave my dad?

770
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:40,083
If this is going to work

771
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:44,250
these people will need
your strength.

772
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,375
Your guidance.

773
00:43:46,417 --> 00:43:48,458
Oh, damn.

774
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:55,208
What does he do again?

775
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,834
Prime Minister.

776
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,417
Sounds important.

777
00:43:58,458 --> 00:43:59,709
Oh, it is.

778
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,166
Sounds like
he might have

779
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,792
more than two coins
to rub together.

780
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:06,625
Three husbands?

781
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,417
Uh-huh.
