00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,166
In here, Data.

4
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,000
Got her now.

5
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,208
She's trapped.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,583
Come on out of there,

(<i> Spot snarls</i> )

8
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:26,667
Hey, hey,
don't you spit at me.

9
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,125
Why is Spot
under the bed?

10
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,667
Probably because she knows
if I catch her

11
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:34,166
I'm going to kill her.

12
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,291
Has Spot been misbehaving?

13
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:40,250
So far, she's broken a vase

14
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,208
a teapot

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,875
she's ruined
one of my chairs

16
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,542
using it
as a scratch post

17
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,500
and she's coughing hair balls up
all over my carpet.

18
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:49,709
These incidents are common
to cat owners.

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,792
When you borrowed Spot, you said
you wanted to experience

20
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,917
the full range
of feline behavior

21
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,750
before getting a cat yourself.

22
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,208
Yeah, well, I'm not ready.

23
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,208
You can take her back
with my blessings.

24
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,709
Go ahead, call her.

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,083
Spot does not respond
to verbal commands.

26
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,250
She doesn't come
when<i> you</i> call her?

27
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:11,709
Data...

28
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,333
have you ever considered
training this cat?

29
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,709
I never found it
to be necessary.

30
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,291
Necessary? Data,
the cat is out of control.

31
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,000
Half the time, I didn't know
if she was going lick me

32
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,583
or scratch my face off.

33
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:28,041
I have never experienced
this kind of behavior in Spot.

34
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,875
Although she does have
the unfortunate habit

35
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:32,583
of jumping on my computer
console when I am working.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,208
She needs training.

37
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,875

38
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:39,333
Please report
to the Observation Lounge.

in ten minutes.

40
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,583
All right, we have to get
her out of here.

41
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:46,208
I'll scare her, you grab her
when she comes out, okay?

42
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,375
I do not think it would be
wise to startle her.

<i>of this particular</i>

58
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,291
The<i> Fleming</i> last contacted
Starfleet four days ago.

59
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,583
According to them, there was
nothing out of the ordinary

60
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,291
when they entered the corridor.

61
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,834
Data.

62
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,125
The unusually intense
tetryon field in this sector

63
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,458
poses a severe
navigational hazard

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,709
to warp-driven vessels.

65
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,458
The Hekaras Corridor

66
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,875
is the only route in this sector
which is free of tetryon fields.

67
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:29,333
Ships traveling at warp
must use the corridor

68
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,834
to ensure safe passage

69
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,125
through the region.

70
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,250
How long will it take

71
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,458
to complete
a level-1 search?

72
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,875
At least two days, sir.

73
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:38,959
The corridor is over
12 light-years long

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,959
and the surrounding
tetryon interference

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,583
will limit our sensor range.

76
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,250
Could we send out
reconnaissance probes

77
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,500
to supplement the sensors?

78
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,250
LA FORGE:
Won't be very effective.

79
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,500
The interference will
make it difficult

80
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:50,083
to maintain contact
with the probes.

81
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,542
Best we can do is to
increase sensor efficiency.

82
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,458
We've installed
multiphase buffers

83
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,291
on all the sensor
modules, Captain.

84
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,041
It should help
a little.

85
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,417
Hekaras II is inhabited,
isn't it?

86
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,417
Maybe they've had
contact with the<i> Fleming.</i>

87
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,875
They haven't.

88
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,709
I've already spoken
to the Hekaran government.

89
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,208
According to them, only one ship

90
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,375
has passed through the system
in the last week.

91
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,208
It was a Ferengi trader.

92
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,792
The<i> Fleming </i> was carrying
a supply of rare biomimetic gel

93
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:13,875
which is very valuable.

94
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:15,458
Is it possible
that the Ferengi

95
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,583
might have hijacked it?

96
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,417
I wouldn't put it past them.

97
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,041
I think we should prepare
for that contingency.

98
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,208
I agree.

99
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,500
All right then.

100
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,458
Mr. Worf, initiate
your search pattern.

101
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,417
Let's head in.

102
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,208
DATA:
Geordi?

103
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,667
There has been
a slight drop

104
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:38,417
in sensor
efficiency.

105
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,208
Perhaps we should examine
the phase buffers.

106
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,291
No, problem, Data.
I'll be right with you.

107
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,875
Okay, Hansen, transfer
the EPS conduit 13

108
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:46,375
to the stabilizer matrix.

109
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:48,041
HANSEN:
Aye, sir.

110
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,959
Is there a problem
with the engines?

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,333
No.

112
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,959
Then why are you
stabilizing the
EPS conduit?

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,333
Just trying to get
a slightly higher
power conversion level.

114
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:03,333
But that would not affect
the engines in any way.

115
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,458
I know that, Data.

116
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,709
It's not the point.

117
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,875
What is the point?

118
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:08,375
I'm just trying to get

119
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,000
a higher conversion
level, that's all.

120
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,583
Why?

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,458
You know the<i> Intrepid.</i>

122
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,083
Yes.

123
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,291
Well, their Chief Engineer
is Commander Donald Kaplan.

124
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,166
He and I went through
the Academy together.

125
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,375
I just like to make sure

126
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,458
that our power
conversion levels

127
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,750
are a little bit
higher than theirs.

128
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:31,959
I understand.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,291
You are in competition
with Mr. Kaplan.

130
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,792
You might say that.

131
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,458
This is the flagship.

132
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,291
We<i> should</i> be better
than everybody else.

133
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:43,125
Then you are trying
to outperform the<i> Intrepid?</i>

134
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,291
Actually, it's more a
matter of personal pride.

135
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,917
I mean, these
are<i> my</i> engines.

136
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,583
There's nothing wrong

137
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,041
with a little
friendly rivalry.

138
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,792
Okay. Computer

139
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:56,208
how much have
the conversion
levels increased?

140
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,542
COMPUTER:
Levels are unchanged.

141
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,709
All right, I'll deal
with this later.

142
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,750
Let me give you a hand
with those sensors.

143
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,000
How's that?

144
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,542
One moment.

145
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,500
The phase buffer
is operating

146
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,667
within normal
parameters.

147
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:28,083
Sensor efficiency has
increased by... 6.7%.

148
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,792
Six point seven?

149
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:33,125
One of the stages must
still be out of alignment.

150
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,500
Let's try junction A-9.

151
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:44,667
Geordi, I have taken
your suggestion regarding Spot.

152
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,208
Coming down.

153
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,750
I have begun training her.

154
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,041
Really?

155
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,458
Yes, I am studying
several new techniques.

156
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,834
Huh.

157
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,250
I began with simple
conditioned-response exercises

158
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,750
and followed with
environmental enhancement.

159
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:05,291
Next, I plan to explore
bioconditioning devices.

160
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,750
Devices?!

161
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:09,417
Such as sensor nets
for behavior modification

162
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,250
or biofeedback
motivators.

163
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,375
Unfortunately, I have been
less than successful.

164
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,500
I've got an idea.

165
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,834
How about a phaser?

166
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,208
A low stun setting
at just the right moment

167
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,417
might do
the trick.

168
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,834
Geordi, I cannot stun my cat.

169
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,834
I was kidding, Data.

170
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:37,208
Let's see what we've got.

171
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,208
No, this isn't it,
either.

172
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,709
Clearly, there is
a misalignment

173
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,250
somewhere
in this system.

174
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,709
That's for sure.

175
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,166
Well, we've got
one more possibility.

176
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,750
Junction at C-12?

177
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:03,792
I am somewhat concerned
that my training efforts

178
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,166
will ultimately fail.

179
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,834
Maybe you're just
going about it

180
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,333
the wrong way, Data.

181
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,792
I have consulted numerous
animal training manuals.

182
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:13,083
Some of them claim

183
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,375
that cats are
inherently untrainable.

184
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,750
Ah, I don't believe
that for a second.

185
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,041
Listen to me--

186
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,917
my sister didn't know
a thing about animals

187
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,041
and she was able
to train<i> her</i> cat.

188
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,792
How complicated
could it be?

189
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,875
What did she train
her cat to do?

190
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:30,458
She had that cat jumping
into her arm on command.

191
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,792
Interesting.

192
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:33,875
Perhaps I could modify
your sister's techniques

193
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:35,792
to keep Spot from
jumping on the console.

194
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:38,291
Do you know how
she was able
to train her cat?

195
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,208
Well, as I recall, she walked
around for two months

196
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,291
with a piece of tuna
in her blouse.

197
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,709
Hmm.

198
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,750
I was right.

199
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:59,000
This buffer<i> is</i> 
out of alignment.

200
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,417
Okay, try that.

201
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,333
Phase alignment
is stabilized.

202
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,250
However, sensor efficiency

203
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:14,709
has increased by only
an additional 1.3%.

204
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,875
Well, it's not much

205
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,291
but every little
bit's going to help.

206
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,333
Riker to Data.

207
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,875
Data here.

208
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:22,166
We're picking up a ship ahead
on long-range sensors.

209
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,959
If you and Geordi
are through down there

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,500
we'd like to have you
on the Bridge.

211
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,834
We're not going
to squeeze

212
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,291
anything else out
of these systems.

213
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,583
Acknowledged, sir.
We are on our way.

214
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,041
We are within
visual range, sir.

215
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,542
On screen.

216
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,041
WORF:
It is a Ferengi transport ship.

217
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,166
D'kora-class.

218
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,959
RIKER:
That's the same Ferengi vessel

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,917
that entered the corridor
a week ago.

220
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,000
LA FORGE:
Captain, there are no emissions
from their plasma vents.

221
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,750
Their warp drive
must be completely inactive.

222
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:50,875
That is correct, sir.

223
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,083
Their impulse system
is down as well.

224
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,000
Power generation
is at extremely low levels.

225
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,667
What about life signs?

226
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:00,041
Life-support systems are also
functioning at low levels.

227
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,959
There are approximately
450 Ferengi on board.

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,500
That is a standard complement
for a ship of that class.

229
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:10,834
Mr. Worf,
open a hailing frequency.

230
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,667
There is no response
on any channel, sir.

231
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,375
LA FORGE:
I'm not picking up

232
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:18,166
any subspace emissions
from the ship at all, Captain.

233
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,208
Looks like every one of their
field coils has been overloaded.

234
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,041
That would explain why they
haven't responded to our hails.

235
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,500
DATA:
It would
also explain

236
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,625
the failure of their warp drive.

237
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,875
Captain, the Ferengi sensors
are still on line.

238
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:32,125
I could modify one
of our deflector emitters

239
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,792
to transmit
old-style delta waves.

240
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:35,792
If I modulate that
with a com signal

241
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,959
the Ferengi should be able
to pick that up.

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,041
Make it so.

243
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,500
If they did hijack
the<i> Fleming</i>

244
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:42,583
they sure didn't get
very far with the cargo.

245
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,875
Mr. Worf, have tractor
beams standing by.

246
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:47,500
We may have to take
them under tow.

247
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,500
Helm, take us
within tractor range.

248
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,792
Aye, sir.

249
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:53,083
Captain I am picking up
power emissions

250
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,792
from the Ferengi vessel.

251
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,542
They are locking weapons.

252
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,959
Shields up!

253
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,417
RIKER:
Ready phasers.
Prepare to return fire.

254
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,792
PICARD:
Target their weapons array only.

255
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:13,041
Phasers locked.
Fire!

256
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,875
Direct hit--
their weapon systems are down.

257
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:19,959
Damage report.

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,208
We sustained minimal damage

259
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,333
to decks five and seven, sir.

260
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,959
Captain, the Ferengi ship's
power has stabilized.

261
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,208
They appear to have
impulse capability.

262
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,917
They were just
playing dead--

263
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,417
conserving power until
we got in close enough.

264
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,417
And why would
they attack us
in the first place?

265
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,750
Somehow, I don't think

266
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,333
they'll let us beam
over there and ask them.

267
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,875
Mr. La Forge,
how are you coming

268
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,000
with that
com link?

269
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,125
Almost ready, Captain.

270
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,750
All right, let's give it a try.

271
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:47,166
PICARD:
Open a channel.

272
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,834
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

273
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,458
Will you please explain
why you attacked us?

274
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,792
<i>Our</i> attack?

275
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:10,750
We were defending ourselves.

276
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,834
Do you deny
that you are responsible

277
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,750
for disabling my vessel?

278
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:19,083
Daimon, your ship was adrift,
your communications inoperable.

279
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,917
We were attempting
to assess your status.

280
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,875
You were attempting to move in
for the kill.

281
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:27,417
Do not toy with me, Picard.

282
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:31,500
We are obviously at your mercy,
but know this:

283
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:34,583
when the Ferengi Council
learns of your actions

284
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,750
they will consider this
an act of war.

285
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:41,291
Daimon, clearly, there has been
some misunderstanding.

286
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,500
I think it would be
in all our interests

287
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:46,709
if you were to come aboard
and we discussed this situation.

288
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,375
I see no reason
to trust you, human.

289
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:55,208
In that case,
we'll be on our way.

290
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,208
I will relay your position
to your government, if you wish

291
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,208
in case you're unable
to complete your repairs

292
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,542
and you remain stranded.

293
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,667
Perhaps, uh...

294
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,500
it would be better
to discuss the situation.

295
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,291
We detected what
appeared to be

296
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,125
a Federation
signal buoy.

297
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,083
When we approached it

298
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,125
it emitted
a massive verteron pulse.

299
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,917
Our warp drive,
our sensors

300
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,959
our communications systems
were all disabled.

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,959
We assume we were the victims
of a new Federation weapon.

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,417
PICARD:
The Federation

303
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,041
established this corridor

304
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,083
to ensure a safe access
through this sector.

305
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,667
We have nothing to gain
by mining it.

306
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,208
Whatever happened to your ship

307
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,041
may not have been
an isolated incident.

308
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,792
A Federation medical transport

309
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,542
was recently lost
in that corridor.

310
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,750
We passed a Federation ship
several days ago.

311
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:00,875
It did not appear
to be in any distress.

312
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,625
Can you give us an idea
of its heading?

313
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,875
It is possible
that information was recorded

314
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,792
in our sensor logs, Commander.

315
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:13,083
Unfortunately, my entire crew
is occupied with our repairs!

316
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,834
I don't think there will be time
to search our records.

317
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,166
Daimon, if we assigned
an engineering team

318
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,458
to assist you
with your repair efforts

319
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,500
would that give you time
to retrieve your logs?

320
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:31,333
I believe it would, Captain.

321
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,959
Spot?

322
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,083

00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,834
(<i> meows</i> )

359
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,542
Hmm.

360
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,041
I don't know
about Spot

361
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,750
but, seems to me,<i> your</i> training
is coming along just fine.

362
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,291
Come on,
let's go.

363
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:32,166
Data, keep the EPS
constant, will you

364
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,542
while I remodulate
the power taps?

365
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,333
This procedure
will only increase

366
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,166
the conversion level
by 0.8%.

367
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,709
I know, but it could
be just enough.

368
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,875
Enough?

369
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:47,125
I just received this from
Commander Kaplan, subspace.

370
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,291
"La Forge, I got

371
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,625
"the<i> Intrepid's</i> power
conversion levels up to 97.1%.

372
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,250
"Maybe you should
try cleaning

373
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,250
your plasma grid
once in a while."

374
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,208
Can you believe
the nerve of that guy?

375
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,083
We perform maintenance
on the plasma grid

376
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,250
at regular intervals.

377
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,333
I know.

378
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,250
He's just trying
to get me angry.

379
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,750
There.

380
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,417
That should do it.

381
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,709
Computer,
what are the current
power conversion levels?

382
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,834
Power conversion levels
are at 97.2%.

383
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,125
Too bad, Mr. Kaplan.

384
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,125
(<i> chuckles</i> )

385
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,333
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

386
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,417
<i>We have traced the</i> Fleming's
<i>most likely course.</i>

387
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,208
<i>It now appears that the vessel</i>

388
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,750
<i>may have come</i>
<i>to an unfortunate end.</i>

389
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,959
What's the origin
of this debris field?

390
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,291
Unknown, sir.

391
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,709
It does not appear

392
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,166
in any of the Federation charts
of the corridor.

393
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,583
Could it be what's left
of the<i> Fleming?</i>

394
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,083
It is a possibility.

395
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,875
The debris
consists primarily

396
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,959
of duranium and
polycomposite fragments

397
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,834
which suggest a ship.

398
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,375
Furthermore, the field
contains sufficient mass

399
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,583
to account for
the<i> Fleming.</i>

400
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,625
All right.

401
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,208
Let's take
a closer look.

402
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,166
Maybe we can find
something that
will give us

403
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,208
a more positive
identification.

404
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,709
Helm, take us through
the debris field.

405
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,458
Ahead slow.

406
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,709
Captain, I am picking up
a small, metallic object

407
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,041
approximately 3.5 meters

408
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,542
in diameter.

409
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,542
Could be a ship's log recorder,
or a probe casing.

410
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,709
I do not believe so.

411
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,875
It is emitting
an unusual signal.

412
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:19,291
Captain

413
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,166
it is beginning to generate
a verteron field.

414
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,000
Shields up!
Full reverse! Now!

415
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,208
Damage report.

416
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,625
Warp engines are off-line.

417
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,875
Shields are down.

418
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,375
All subspace systems
are inoperative.

419
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:40,083
Just like the Ferengi vessel.

420
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,709
Unidentified ship

421
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,375
heading toward us--
two life-forms are aboard.

422
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:45,959
On screen.

423
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,125
Captain, they are initiating
their transporter system.

424
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,208
Can we get more power
to the shields?

425
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,000
No, sir.

426
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,959
All decks, security alert!

427
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,667
Captain, we are being boarded.

428
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,125
La Forge to Bridge.

429
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,625
We have intruders
in Main Engineering.

430
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,750
I need a security team
down here immediately.

431
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:08,208
WORF:
It's on its way.

432
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,041
What do you want?

433
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,041
We're trying
to make you listen.

434
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,834
You're killing us.

435
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,625
You have made a very
serious accusation.

436
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,834
I want you to explain it.

437
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,625
Captain, according
to our research

438
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:28,959
warp fields cause

439
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,500
a dangerous reaction
in this region of space.

440
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:33,250
Our planet is
already being affected.

441
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,417
We have measured large
gravitational shifts

442
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,792
throughout our system.

443
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:38,333
If something isn't done

444
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,750
our planet will
become uninhabitable.

445
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:42,709
Captain, I've heard
this theory before.

446
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,542
Their research was evaluated by
the Federation Science Council

447
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,583
a few years ago.

448
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,083
Quite frankly,
it didn't hold up.

449
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,291
That research was
only preliminary.

450
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,709
Our original analysis
was incomplete.

451
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,709
If you wanted us
to review your research

452
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,542
you should have made a request
through the Science Council.

453
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,083
Their resources are limited.

454
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,959
It would have taken over a year

455
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,750
before they dispatched
a science ship

456
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,417
to come and evaluate our work.

457
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,542
We were not willing to wait
any longer.

458
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,709
We knew that
if we disabled enough ships

459
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,250
Starfleet would come.

460
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,333
Then, at least, we would be able
to present our case.

461
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,208
That's how you rationalize
these attacks?

462
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,667
Neither you nor the Ferengi

463
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,875
suffered any casualties,
Commander.

464
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:21,458
The actual damage
to your vessels was negligible.

465
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,625
We dispersed verteron probes
in the corridor

466
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:27,125
merely to disable warp-driven
ships-- nothing more.

467
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,291
You can call it whatever you
like, the fact remains

468
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,583
you deliberately disguised
your probes.

469
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,208
You made them
look like signal markers.

470
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,750
You hid them
in the debris field.

471
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:37,333
You mined
the corridor!

472
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:40,250
Mr. La Forge,
how long do you estimate

473
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,041
it will take
to restore the engines?

474
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,041
Their verteron pulse overloaded
our field coils, Captain.

475
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,000
It'll take at least 36 hours
to get underway.

476
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,625
I know precisely how our pulse
affected your field coils.

477
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:54,542
With my help, your ship could be
operational in ten hours--

478
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,125
provided you agree
to review our research.

479
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,792
Because of the seriousness
of your claim

480
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:01,875
I am willing
to listen to your case.

481
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:03,417
But let there be no mistake--

482
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,041
our priority here is
the recovery of the<i> Fleming.</i>

483
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,291
Now, I expect you to help us
restore our engines

484
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,166
and deactivate all
of the remaining probes

485
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,625
in the corridor.

486
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:14,542
If you do not, you will both
be taken to the brig

487
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,709
and from there
to the nearest Starbase

488
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,250
where you will answer charges
for what you have done.

489
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:22,083
My sister and I do not wish
to impede your rescue process.

490
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,458
Rabal, don't.

491
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,166
The probes are the only
leverage we have.

492
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,792
Serova.

493
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:33,583
We will do as you ask, Captain,
but please, reexamine our data.

494
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:34,959
We will.

495
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,625
It is part of our job
to retain an open mind

496
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,041
even under these circumstances.

497
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,291
Mr. La Forge, take them
to Engineering.

498
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,125
Get the core
back on line.

499
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,500
Yes, sir.

500
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:44,667
Mr. Data, I want you
to review their research.

501
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:45,792
I'd like your report

502
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,083
as soon
as possible.

503
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,250
There.
Shields have been restored.

504
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,583
You will be able
to reengage your engines

505
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,083
in approximately
eight hours.

506
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,792
You know, even when we get
the engines on line

507
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:11,834
it's going to take
at least a week

508
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,917
to recalibrate them properly.

509
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,750
I'm sorry you've been
inconvenienced

510
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:18,709
but that's all it is--
an inconvenience.

511
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,625
Our concerns are
much more important

512
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,250
than the condition
of your engines.

513
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,917
What if the<i> Fleming</i> 
had been transporting

514
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:26,417
perishable supplies
or was on an emergency mission?

515
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,667
Your little plan might
have cost a lot of lives.

516
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:30,041
That didn't happen,
Commander.

517
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,291
And saving lives

518
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,709
is precisely what
we're trying to do.

519
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,792
Yeah, well, you have
a very interesting way
of going about it.

520
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:38,709
There's no point
in trying to talk to you.

521
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,959
You've already decided
not to listen.

522
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,792
RABAL:
Commander

523
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:48,250
I know my sister
can be somewhat, uh...

524
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,500
aggravating.

525
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:50,750
I'd have to agree
with that.

526
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,458
But, please, try
to understand--

527
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,917
she believes profoundly
in this cause.

528
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:56,667
She has sworn
to dedicate her life

529
00:23:56,709 --> 00:23:58,875
to exposing the dangers
of warp drive.

530
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:01,750
Warp drive has been around
for three centuries.

531
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,792
It's a proven
technology.

532
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:06,542
And you sound just like I did--
about four years ago.

533
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,667
You mean, you didn't
believe her either?

534
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:13,208
No. What I didn't realize was
just how brilliant my sister is.

535
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,125
It took two years
of study for me

536
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:18,417
to even grasp the principles
behind her theoretical models.

537
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,625
They're that sophisticated.

538
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,417
Well, our Commander Data
is no slouch.

539
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:26,500
If there's anything there,
he'll find it.

540
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:27,792
Well, I hope so.

541
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,709
Because once we
persuade Starfleet

542
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,583
to stop warp travel
through the corridor

543
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,709
we're going to have
to convince our own people

544
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,583
to give up warp drive
completely.

545
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:39,083
Hekaras II is the only
inhabited world in this region.

546
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,166
Without warp drive,
you'd be completely isolated

547
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,417
from the rest of the Federation.

548
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,500
Are you really willing

549
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:46,583
to take that step?

550
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:49,250
Yes, and if you were
in my position

551
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:52,333
I hope you'd be willing
to do the same thing.

552
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,625
Serova and Rabal believe
that there are regions

553
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:06,291
of potential subspace
instability within the corridor.

554
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,041
They believe
that if these regions

555
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,875
continue to be exposed
to warp field energy

556
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,542
they will rupture.

557
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:15,166
Subspace will extrude into
normal space, forming a rift.

558
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,458
It's like pacing up and down
on the same piece of carpet--

559
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,792
eventually you wear it out.

560
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:21,375
That analogy
is essentially correct, sir.

561
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:23,041
Can this theory be proven?

562
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,125
Not at this
time, sir.

563
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,125
There is
insufficient

564
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,792
evidence to do so.

565
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,166
In order to determine
whether or not a rift will form

566
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,792
a region must be exposed
to warp field energy

567
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,750
approximately
one million times greater

568
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:36,166
than that normally generated
by a starship.

569
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:39,000
Commander, we believe
the warp field effect
is cumulative.

570
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,458
Each starship that passes
through the corridor at warp

571
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,792
brings us one step closer

572
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,625
to forming
a rift.

573
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,458
I agree that is a possibility.

574
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,375
Captain,
I suggest we ask

575
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,834
the Federation Science Council

576
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:53,125
to send a research
vessel to this area.

577
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:54,583
A more detailed
investigation

578
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,250
would resolve
many of our questions.

579
00:25:56,291 --> 00:26:00,709
That's your response--
more research, more<i> delays.</i>

580
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,542
I suppose I shouldn't have
expected anything different.

581
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:05,250
RIKER:
Bridge to Captain Picard.

582
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:07,083
Go ahead, Number One.

583
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:09,583
We've located the<i> Fleming</i> 
on long-range sensors--

584
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:12,041
approximately
0.3 light years away.

585
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,583
What's her condition?

586
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,041
The vessel appears to be intact.

587
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,792
They have shields,
but it looks

588
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:18,792
like their subspace
systems are out.

589
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:19,917
Very well.

590
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,125
We'll be under way

591
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,583
as soon as our engines
are on line.

592
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:23,792
Aye, sir.

593
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,291
I would like you all
to put together

594
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,083
a research proposal
for the Science Council.

595
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,250
I will give it
my full recommendation.

596
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,500
Captain, I appreciate the
opportunity you're giving us.

597
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:33,208
It's a beginning
that we...

598
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,500
Not "we."

599
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,583
You can do whatever
you want, Rabal.

600
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,792
I'll have no part of this.

601
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:41,083
It's just another delay.

602
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,792
(<i> sighs</i> )

603
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:48,500
Captain, the engines
are back on line.

604
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:49,667
All systems are ready.

605
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:50,959
Very good.

606
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,166
Helm, lay in a course
for the<i> Fleming.</i>

607
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,500
Aye, sir.

608
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:55,250
They appear to be
in pretty good condition.

609
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,417
Our sensors show their shields
are back to full strength.

610
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,041
WORF:
Captain, the Hekaran ship

611
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:01,542
is moving off.

612
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,250
There is one person on board.

613
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,625
It is Serova.

614
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:10,000
Doctor, what is going on?

615
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,333
I don't know.

616
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,291
Captain, may I speak to her?

617
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,792
Mr. Worf, open a channel.

618
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:20,333
RABAL:
Serova, what are
you trying to do?

619
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,166
They wanted proof.

620
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,834
I'm going to give it to them.

621
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,792
I'm sorry.

622
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,667
Captain,
the Hekaran ship's engines

623
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:34,834
are beginning to overload.

624
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:37,417
I believe Serova
is attempting to create

625
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,000
a warp core breach.

626
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:41,208
No.

627
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,625
RIKER:
Prepare for impact.

628
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:49,125
Shields at maximum.
Full reverse.

629
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,667
Report.

630
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:53,458
DATA:
We are clear
of the shock wave.

631
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,875
However, tetryon flux in
the area is increasing rapidly.

632
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:10,959
It's incredible.

633
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,959
Mr. Data

634
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,583
what's your analysis?

635
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,750
The event is approximately
0.1 light years in diameter

636
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,792
and it is emitting
extremely high levels

637
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,208
of tetryon radiation.

638
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,417
It appears to be

639
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,166
what Rabal and
Serova predicted--

640
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,750
a subspace rift.

641
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,625
She was right.

642
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,667
Can you get a fix
on the<i> Fleming?</i>

643
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,667
Is she still in one piece?
Scanning.

644
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:35,834
The<i> Fleming</i> is near
its previous coordinates.

645
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:39,125
It appears to be intact,
but it is now within the rift.

646
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:42,959
Doctor, is it possible
for a ship to survive in there?

647
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:48,333
Doctor, I'm sorry about your
loss, but we need your help now.

648
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,375
Of course, Captain.

649
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:54,500
Does the rift pose any danger
to the<i> Fleming?</i>

650
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,083
I don't know.

651
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,250
What was that?

652
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,750
Some kind of high-energy
distortion wave.

653
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,750
Looks like they're being
generated from within the rift.

654
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:07,834
If we maintain
our current position

655
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,166
our shields should provide
sufficient protection.

656
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:12,834
What about the<i> Fleming?</i> 
How long can they
survive in there?

657
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,458
The waves are even more intense
within the rift.

658
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,458
I estimate her shields will fail

659
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,834
in approximately
12 hours.

660
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,583
Can we risk going in there
to get them out?

661
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,917
LA FORGE:
Not at warp, Commander.

662
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,458
According to these readings

663
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,417
the rift is in a state
of accelerating instability

664
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,959
which would make it
extremely sensitive

665
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,125
to warp field energies.

666
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,166
If we go in at warp

667
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:31,750
we might expand it even further.

668
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:34,583
I don't think
we have a choice.

669
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,458
It would take weeks
to reach them at impulse.

670
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,166
I want some better options.

671
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:41,125
Data, Geordi, take Dr. Rabal
and begin an analysis

672
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,375
of the rift.

673
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:48,375
We need to find some way to get
the<i> Fleming</i> out of there.

674
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:53,750

680
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,500
I can't find any way

681
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:09,000
to close the rift
or even reduce its size.

682
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,291
Doctor, is it possible

683
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,792
there are areas inside
the rift which are stable

684
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:19,667
where we can safely
use our warp engines?

685
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:21,917
Perhaps.

686
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:24,083
Computer, scan
the rift

687
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:26,792
for regions of
low instability.

688
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:28,125
There's no area

689
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,375
stable enough
to withstand a warp pulse.

690
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:31,500
Wait a minute.

691
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:33,709
This is strange.

692
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,834
Computer, display grid Delta-17.

693
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,917
Enhance and magnify.

694
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:44,375
What do you make of that?

695
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:49,125
It's a subspace instability--
outside the rift.

696
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:51,375
That should not be possible.

697
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:52,792
Commander, I'm going to begin

698
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,500
a field-enhanced scan
of this sector.

699
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:58,375
I'd like to get
a closer look at this.

700
00:30:58,417 --> 00:30:59,875
In the meantime, we'd
better tell the Captain

701
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,250
we don't know how to get
to the<i> Fleming.</i>

702
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,709
I am not certain
that is true.

703
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,750
I believe
I have an idea.

704
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:12,667
I suggest
we coast into the rift.

705
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:14,333
Coast?

706
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:17,250
We can initiate a brief,
high-intensity warp pulse

707
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,917
from our current position.

708
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,625
We should be able to attain

709
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,625
sufficient velocity
to enter the rift

710
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,166
beam the crew
off the<i> Fleming</i>

711
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:27,375
and exit without using
our warp engines.

712
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:30,333
All right, let's say we initiate
a full-power warp pulse.

713
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:32,667
How much time do we need
to drop out of warp?

714
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:34,583
If we field-saturate
the nacelles

715
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:37,083
we should be able
to sustain warp speed

716
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,000
for approximately two minutes.

717
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,792
That doesn't give us much time.

718
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:43,250
And it could get
pretty rough in there.

719
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:45,417
Our timing will be critical.

720
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:46,959
Begin your calculations,
Mr. Data.

721
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,709
We'll go as soon
as you're ready.

722
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,291
Aye, sir.

723
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

724
00:31:55,709 --> 00:32:00,250
I believe the maximum saturation
level should be 18.3%.

725
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:01,917
All right.

726
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,250
With these parameters

727
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:05,208
we should be able
to maintain warp speed

728
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,792
for... two minutes,
eight seconds.

729
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:08,792
I don't think we can get
any more than that.

730
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:11,792
I agree, but based on
the size of the rift

731
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:14,959
it should give us sufficient
time to complete the rescue.

732
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,500
Computer, initiate
nacelle field saturation.

733
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,125
How did we
miss it, Data?

734
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:24,250
Beg your pardon.

735
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:26,500
How did we miss
the connection

736
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:29,375
between warp drive
and the formation of the rift?

737
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:30,875
Between the two of us

738
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:33,250
we've logged thousands of hours
on these engines.

739
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:36,625
We're supposed
to be warp field experts.

740
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:39,291
We certainly were wrong
this time.

741
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,417
Technically, Geordi,
we were not wrong.

742
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,208
Serova's theories
rested on assumptions

743
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,583
which were unprovable.

744
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:47,208
Seems to me she managed
to prove them

745
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,667
pretty conclusively.

746
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:50,458
By using methods

747
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,166
any reputable scientist
would never employ.

748
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:59,542
Yeah, she was willing to die
in order to make her point.

749
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:02,041
We should have listened to her
more closely, Data.

750
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:07,542
We reviewed Serova's research
to the best of our abilities

751
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:10,625
and we were prepared to continue
studying the problem

752
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,333
but that was unsatisfactory.

753
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,333
Yeah, I can remember times
when I was a little stubborn.

754
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,583
Trying to get people
to believe me

755
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,417
when I didn't have
enough proof.

756
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,333
I do not believe you would have
resorted to such extremes.

757
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,166
But she had to--

758
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,792
just to get us to listen.

759
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,375
Why was I so resistant?

760
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:32,333
Perhaps because
her aggressive methods

761
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:34,667
created
an adversarial situation.

762
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:36,792
Yeah.

763
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:42,667
Maybe I was taking
the whole thing personally.

764
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:45,166
I do not understand.

765
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:47,000
(<i> sighs</i> )

766
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:52,083
Maybe... I was
a little threatened.

767
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,709
The thought that warp engines

768
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,000
might be doing
some kind of damage.

769
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,750
It's going to take
another half an hour

770
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:06,166
for the nacelles
to saturate.

771
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,792
Will you call me
when they're done?

772
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,083
Commander.

773
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,917
May I join you?

774
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:49,375
I wanted to say I'm sorry
about your sister.

775
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,041
Thank you.

776
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,291
I'm trying to tell myself

777
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:59,750
that she died
for what she believed in

778
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:02,458
but, somehow,
that isn't much comfort.

779
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,291
I wish it could have happened
differently.

780
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,208
Maybe I should have looked
at the research more closely.

781
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,542
It's possible there's something
that I missed.

782
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:13,542
No, you didn't miss anything.

783
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,834
The problem was time.

784
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:20,291
We needed more time
to do the proper research.

785
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,959
Serova wasn't willing to wait.

786
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,500
No. I guess the question is,
now, where do we go from here?

787
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,709
I don't think we can look
at space travel

788
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,583
the same way anymore.

789
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,375
We're going to have to change.

790
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:39,458
I've been in Starfleet
a long time.

791
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,250
We depend on warp drive.

792
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:46,000
I just don't know how easy
it's going to be to change.

793
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:51,333
It won't be easy at all.

794
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:58,125
Captain, warp pulse
calculations are complete.

795
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:00,792
We will be firing the engines
at maximum intensity

796
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:03,583
for 6.3 seconds
before disengaging.

797
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,083
WORF:
Damage control teams
are standing by on all decks.

798
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:08,750
The course to the<i> Fleming</i> 
is plotted and laid in, sir.

799
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:12,291
Mr. La Forge,
whenever you're ready.

800
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,375
Aye, sir.

801
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:18,000
Initiating warp pulse... now.

802
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,083
Engines disengaged.

803
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,750
We are now
entering the rift.

804
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,875
Hull stress
is increasing--

805
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:33,834
83% of maximum tolerance
and rising.

806
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,709
How long until
we reach the<i> Fleming?</i>

807
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,750
One minute, 22 seconds.

808
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:40,083
All transporter rooms
are standing by.

809
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:43,709
Captain, I'm picking up power
emissions from the<i> Fleming.</i>

810
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,583
They may be attempting
to initiate

811
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:47,291
their warp drive.

812
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,125
They might have been able
to repair their engines.

813
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,375
Captain, if
they activate...

814
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,500
I know, Mr. Data.

815
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,375
Can we establish
communication?

816
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:57,083
WORF:
No, sir-- subspace interference
is too high.

817
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:59,000
How long until we reach
transporter range?

818
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,458
WORF:
53 seconds.

819
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,792
I don't think
we're going to make it.

820
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:06,750
Captain, they have initiated
their warp drive.

821
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:09,625
Report.

822
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:12,917
WORF:
Damage on decks six and 14.

823
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,875
Our structural integrity field
is holding.

824
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:16,041
What about
the<i> Fleming?</i>

825
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,750
They are badly
damaged, sir.

826
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:19,291
Their life-support
systems are failing.

827
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,667
All transporter rooms

828
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:23,000
prepare emergency
evacuation procedures.

829
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:27,250
Captain, when the<i> Fleming</i>
activated their warp drive

830
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:30,375
the rift increased by 2.3%.

831
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:33,166
We no longer have
sufficient momentum to escape.

832
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:50,959
Distortion wave intensity has
increased by a factor of ten.

833
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,917
We are within transporter range
of the<i> Fleming,</i> sir.

834
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:56,959
Commencing
evacuation procedures.

835
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,750
Distortion waves occurring
every 59 seconds.

836
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:05,125
Hull stress is nearing
maximum tolerance.

837
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,709
Data, what if we forced
an EPS discharge

838
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,125
through the impulse reactor?

839
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,625
Would that be enough
to get us out of here?

840
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,250
I do not believe so, sir

841
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,625
and the resulting explosion
would likely destroy

842
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,917
the saucer section
in the process.

843
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:17,834
Captain, we may be able
to get out of here

844
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:18,959
without using the warp engines.

845
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,583
RIKER:
How, Geordi?

846
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,542
When was the last time
you went surfing, Commander?

847
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:25,083
A distortion wave?

848
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,417
Exactly, Captain.

849
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:29,000
If we can phase-match
our deflector shield

850
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,959
to the EM variants
of the distortion wave

851
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,083
when the next one hits

852
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,583
we'll be pulled along
with it.

853
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,625
We could ride it
through the rift

854
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,542
and then break away
once we're clear--

855
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:40,041
that is, if we
survive the ride.

856
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,500
Is everyone
off the<i> Fleming?</i>

857
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:44,166
The last of the crew
has beamed aboard, sir.

858
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:46,166
All right, Mr. La Forge.

859
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:48,041
Get us out of here.

860
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,792
Yes, sir.

861
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:52,125
Phase-matching
the deflector shields now.

862
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:55,375
The next distortion wave
will impact in 14 seconds.

863
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,834
Matching phases...

864
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:01,750
Prepare to engage
the deflector shield on my mark.

865
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:03,542
DATA:
Ten seconds.

866
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:07,500
And... mark!

867
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:10,375
Engage deflector shield,
full power.

868
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:16,375
We lost it.

869
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:18,083
We were unable to maintain
phase match

870
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,667
with the distortion wave, sir.

871
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:21,083
What went wrong,
Mr. La Forge?

872
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,417
The speed differential
was too high, Captain.

873
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,542
Another distortion wave
approaching.

874
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,917
Impact in 26 seconds.

875
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,625
Our hull stress is
already critical.

876
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,959
We can't handle
many more jolts like that.

877
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,417
Captain, I suggest we take
the ship to full impulse.

878
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,917
If we can attain
sufficient speed

879
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,959
it will lessen the impact
when the wave hits.

880
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Helm, full impulse.

881
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:41,333
Head us out of the rift.

882
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:42,709
Mr. Worf, channel
all available power

883
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,166
to the structural
integrity fields.

884
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,291
Aye, sir.

885
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,750
Stand by,
deflector shields.

886
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:48,041
We're ready, Captain.

887
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,291
Distortion wave impact
in five seconds.

888
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:53,375
Engage deflector shield...<i> now!</i>

889
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,709
We are now
within the distortion wave.

890
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,000
Hull stresses have
exceeded maximum tolerance.

891
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:06,083
Structural integrity fields
are failing on decks ten

892
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:07,083
through 16.

893
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:08,375
Switching to backups.

894
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:10,792
We're separating
from the distortion wave.

895
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:12,583
I'm attempting to compensate.

896
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,291
How much longer until
we clear the rift?

897
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,583
DATA:
Approximately
12 seconds, sir.

898
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:19,500
Hull stress
is 120% above tolerance.

899
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,542
A structural breach is imminent.

900
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,291
We have cleared
the rift, sir.

901
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:36,000
Hull stress has
returned to normal.

902
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,250
Cancel red alert.

903
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:42,375
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47314.5.</i>

904
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:44,208
<i>We have been continuing</i>
<i>our research</i>

905
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,959
<i>while the Federation Council</i>

906
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,583
<i>studies our preliminary reports</i>
<i>on the subspace rift.</i>

907
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:52,458
<i>It now appears certain</i>
<i>that what we've seen here</i>

908
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,291
<i>will have repercussions</i>
<i>for many years to come.</i>

909
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,417
Our scans show a lot
of subspace instabilities

910
00:40:58,458 --> 00:40:59,834
throughout the sector.

911
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,041
If they're exposed
to enough warp energies

912
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,500
they could eventually
create other rifts.

913
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:05,667
Dr. Rabal?

914
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:07,500
Based on current
warp drive patterns

915
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:10,542
in this sector, we've projected
where subspace rifts

916
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:14,250
will be most likely to be formed
over the next 40 years.

917
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:17,208
This is how things are now.

918
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:21,250
This is how they'll look
in ten years...

919
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,834
20 years...

920
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:27,875
30 years...

921
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,709
40 years.

922
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,834
Thank you, Doctor.

923
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,125
Mr. La Forge.

924
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:41,250
Ah...

925
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,875
We've received new directives

926
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,458
from the Federation Council
on this matter.

927
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,750
Until we can find a way

928
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:48,375
to counteract
the warp field effect

929
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,000
the Council feels
our best course

930
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,458
is to slow the damage
as much as possible.

931
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,417
Therefore, areas of space
found susceptible to warp fields

932
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:57,375
will be restricted
to essential travel only

933
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:59,959
and, effective immediately,
all Federation vessels

934
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,583
will be limited to a speed...

935
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,792
of warp five

936
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:08,709
except in cases
of extreme emergency.

937
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,750
Well, the Klingons will
observe these restrictions

938
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:11,917
but the Romulans will not.

939
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:13,333
And what about the Ferengi

940
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,625
and the Cardassians,
for that matter?

941
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,792
The Federation
is sharing all our data

942
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:18,917
with warp-capable species.

943
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:21,250
We can only hope
that they realize

944
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:24,125
it's in their own interests
and take similar action.

945
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,583
Putting limits on warp speed

946
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:27,834
is only going to prevent
other rifts from forming.

947
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,792
What are we going
to do about this one?

948
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:31,917
Unfortunately, right now,
there's not much we can do.

949
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,291
RABAL:
The gravitational shifts

950
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,500
have already begun
to affect my planet's orbit.

951
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:38,250
Our climate is changing.

952
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:39,500
The Federation is setting up

953
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:41,333
a weather control matrix
on Hekaras II.

954
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,458
It's only a temporary solution,
but it should suffice for now.

955
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,959
We're lucky the rift took place

956
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,875
as far away
from the planet as it did.

957
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:49,041
It gives us some time
to consider our options.

958
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:51,583
If there are no more questions,
you're all dismissed.

959
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,792
We should have those
thermal stabilizers ready

960
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:09,834
for the Hekarans
in another day, sir.

961
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:11,125
Very well.

962
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,750
You know, Geordi

963
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:16,291
I've spent the better part of
my life exploring space.

964
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:22,667
I've charted new worlds, I've
met dozens of new species

965
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:26,875
and I believe that these were
all valuable ends in themselves.

966
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:30,875
And now it seems that...
all this while

967
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:34,959
I was... helping to damage

968
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,917
the thing
that I hold most dear.

969
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:39,709
It won't turn out
that way, Captain.

970
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,625
We still have time
to make it better.
