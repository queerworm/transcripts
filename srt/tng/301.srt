00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,375
Go ahead.

4
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:38,917
Forget to set your
alarm, Wesley?

5
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,125
Yes, sir.

6
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,333
I'm very sorry.

7
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,291
I'll be right there.

<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43125.8.</i>

00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,959
<i>We have entered a spectacular</i>
<i>binary star system</i>

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,792
<i>in the Kavis Alpha Sector</i>

11
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:03,792
<i>on a most critical mission</i>
<i>of astrophysical research.</i>

12
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:06,500
<i>Our eminent guest,</i>
<i>Dr. Paul Stubbs</i>

13
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:10,083
<i>will attempt to study</i>
<i>the decay of neutronium</i>

14
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,125

<i>at relativistic speeds</i>

15

16
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:18,041
<i>which will occur here</i>
<i>in a matter of hours.</i>

17
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,542
Ensign,
our position?

18
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,166
Approaching
one million kilometers

19
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,500
from the neutron star, sir.

20
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,083
Slow to one-third
impulse power.

21
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,709
STUBBS:
Spectacular, isn't it,
my young friend?

22
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,250
Yes, sir.

23
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,291
Over and over again,
the intense gravitational pull

24
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,166
of the little neutron star

25
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,250
sucks up the star material
from the red giant

26
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,375
and it builds up
on the surface
until it explodes

27
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:52,959
every 196 years.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,041
Like clockwork.

29
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,000
And it is but 18 hours away.

30
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:03,208
18 hours, seven minutes
and... ten seconds, Doctor.

31
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:11,667
The interstellar counterpart
to Earth's Old Faithful.

32
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:15,333
The only predictable burst
of energy in the universe

33
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,041
that can accomplish our goal.

34
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,625
Doctor Stubbs,
if you would like

35
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,333
to make one final
inspection of...

36
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:28,792
Captain, I have been inspecting
the Egg for the last 20 years.

37
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:31,583
You may lay it when ready.

38
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,959
Begin launch sequence.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,291
Shuttle Bay 2, stand by
to launch... the Egg.

40
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,583
Standing by, Commander.

41
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,500
(<i> warning Klaxon sounds</i> )

42
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,834
Five minutes to launch site.

43
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,083
Stabilize.

44
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,917
The ship isn't responding, sir.

49
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:20,875
Captain, we're heading
straight into the path
of that stellar matter.

Negative.

52
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,583

Dampeners not responding.

Reverse impulse engines.

Initiating reverse sequence...

68
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,166
now.

69
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,667
Our momentum is
still carrying us

70
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:59,917
into the path
of the stellar matter.

71
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,500
12 seconds to impact, sir.

72
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,458
Prepare for impact.

73
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,917
Medical personnel,
report to the Bridge.

74
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,166
Commander Data,
check all systems.

75
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,625
All systems functioning

77
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:28,125
No control malfunction
has been recorded.

78
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,875
Just lay down
carefully.

79
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,500
There you go.

80
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:53,125
Doctor Stubbs, the Captain
asked me to tell you

81
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,458
that our systems
are back to normal

82
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,792
and we can try
another launch attempt

83
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:58,542
as soon
as you're ready.

84
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,875
Quite a dynamic family team--

85
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:03,125
you Crushers.

86
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,375
Well, it's nice
to be together again.

87
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:07,917
I was at Starfleet
Medical for a year.

88
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,083
I missed about...

89
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,792
two inches of him.

90
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:13,917
I'm not sure I'd want my mother

91
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,792
to be flying through
space with me.

92
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:18,500
No, I take
that back.

93
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:19,834
I am sure.

94
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,291
I wouldn't want her.

95
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,875
My mother is

96
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:26,125
a formidable
woman, too.

97
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,333
A woman of letters.

98
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,083
A great critic.

99
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,417
I know.

100
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,208
Good lord, son.

101
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,333
You didn't read
that unauthorized biography?

102
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,417
Is this all this
boy does, Doctor--

103
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,667
fly the ship and read?

104
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,750
Doesn't he ever have any fun?

105
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,917
Sure he does.

106
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,542
Actually, most of my free time
is taken up with my studies.

107
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm trying to get
into Starfleet Academy.

108
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,333
I earn credits for the time
spent on the<i> Enterprise</i>

109
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,417
but it's just not the same.

110
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,709
You ready to sit up?

111
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,583
Well.

112
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:03,959
I am whole again.

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,709
Thank you, Doctor.

114
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,291
Come along, Wesley.

115
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:12,417
Let's go see if Humpty-Dumpty
is still in one piece.

116
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,959
(<i> electronic humming</i> )

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,667
(<i> liquid splashing</i> )

118
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,291
Computer, fix the food slot.

119
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,917
The food slot
is functioning properly.

120
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,125
Well, check again.

121
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,375
The food slot
is functioning properly.

122
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,792
Computer, deactivate food slot.

123
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,000
We're analyzing the engineering
systems data, Captain.

124
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,667
So far, we're showing
nothing unusual

125
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:51,125
in the computer log
for that time period.

126
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,959
Run a level-1 diagnostic series.

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,041
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come.

128
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,667
I, uh... I want a computer
that's 100 percent

129
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,709
to expedite
Doctor Stubbs' experiment

130
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,542
as well as the food slots
in Sick Bay.

131
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,542
Picard, out.

132
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,125
Which seem
to be working again.

133
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,875
For the moment,
anyway.

134
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:10,250
What can I do
for you, Doctor?

135
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:18,750
Jean-Luc, how would you feel
if you were a 17 year old

136
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,500
and the only Starfleet officer

137
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,417
whose mother was on board?

138
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,875
Inhibited... I suppose.

139
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,750
Mmm.

140
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,625
But then I'm not Wesley.

141
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,667
And if you are...

142
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,458
concerned about him

143
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,583
I see no evidence
that there is a problem.

144
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:41,500
I know, but in a funny way,
that's exactly my point.

145
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:42,500
We talk.

146
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:43,500
We smile.

147
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:44,959
It's almost too polite.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,583
Beverly, isn't it
just a matter of time?

149
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,542
I know how difficult it was
for you being away.

150
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,208
Tell me about him.

151
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,417
Well, he's becoming
a very fine officer.

152
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,458
He works as hard
as any member of the crew.

153
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,250
Riker says his studies
are on line...

154
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:19,208
No, tell me about<i> him.</i>

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,583
He's his father's son--

156
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,917
honest

157
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,417
trusting

158
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,291
strong.

159
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,458
Does he have many friends?

160
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,959
Has he ever been in love?

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,917
Um...

162
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,166
Jean-Luc, I'm worried.

163
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,458
He's come so far, so fast

164
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,875
and since I've been back

165
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,250
I don't feel...

166
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,166
His dependence.

167
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,208
Beverly, look, he's...

168
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,041
he's 17 years old.

169
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,959
What were you doing
when you were 17?

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,959
Probably getting into
more trouble than Wesley

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,250
I can assure you.

172
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,500
So was I.

173
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:07,250
Isn't<i> that</i> what 17's
supposed to be?

174
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,125
No cracks in the armor.

175
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,917
We'll do just fine.

176
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,375
How can you be so calm
about this?

177
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,166
If I were about to make
this kind of breakthrough...

178
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,458
I have never doubted
for a moment

179
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,959
that this day would come,
Wesley.

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,625
And I suspect that someday
it will come for you, as well.

181
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:39,583
I see a lot of me in you.

182
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:43,375
In my youth, they
called me a wunderkind.

183
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:46,458
Do you understand
wunderkind?

184
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,834
It's German, isn't it?

185
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,291
It means
"wonder child."

186
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,583
It is reserved
for those of us

187
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,875
who achieve
early in life.

188
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,375
Now the burden
is yours.

189
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:02,709
Burden?

190
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,875
To fulfill
your potential.

191
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,875
You will never
come up against

192
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:10,792
a greater adversary
than your own potential

193
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,041
my young friend.

194
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,375
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

195
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,375
Red alert.

196
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,792
Return to quarters
immediately.

197
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,417
Still no visual contact?

198
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,834
That's impossible.

199
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,208
Mr. Worf, same magnification
50 degrees starboard.

200
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,959
Worf, you're
absolutely sure?

201
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,291
Sensors clearly indicate
the approach of a Borg vessel.

202
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,417
Shields up.

203
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,250
Shields are
not responding.

204
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,542
Manual override is jammed.

205
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,208
It's not gonna work
this time. We don't have
the shields, Captain.

206
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,375
Captain, they're firing
energy weapons at us.

207
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,375
Evasive action.

208
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:52,083
Bring her around to 275,
mark three.

209
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,500
Predict current vector
of Borg vessel.

210
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:55,792
Vector...

211
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,333
It's gone.

212
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,291
And so is the Borg ship.

213
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,959
You telling me this is
another computer glitch?

214
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,875
DATA:
It is conceivable
that he was viewing

215
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,875
a synthetically generated image,
sir.

216
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:11,041
Then our computer
was daydreaming?

217
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,208
PICARD:
Computer.

218
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,458
Identify malfunction
immediately.

219
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,792
COMPUTER:
Pawn to Bishop Four.

220
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,834
Knight to King's Rook Three.

221
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,041
Bishop to Queen's Bishop Four.

222
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,500
Knight to Knight Five.

223
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:25,917
Queen's Knight to...

224
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,291
Controls are
not responding, sir.

225
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,041
Queen to Bishop Three.

226
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,250
Bishop to Bishop Two.

227
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,166
(<i> engines powering down</i> )

228
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,792
Impulse engines are down.

229
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,166
Try warp engines.

230
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,375
Nope, sorry,
Commander.

231
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,291
I'd better get back
to Engineering.

232
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,875
Mr. La Forge
I want Lieutenant Worf
to accompany you.

233
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:48,542
Get me a full report on
the prospects of getting
our shields back.

234
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:53,041
Number One, Mr. Data, will
you join me in the conference
room as soon as possible?

235
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,166
It's time to discuss
the future of this mission...

236
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,875
if there still is one.

237
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,750
The fact of the matter is,
we are dealing

238
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:10,208
with the potential breakdown
of the main computer.

239
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,667
That's hard
to accept.

240
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,458
The system
automatically provides

241
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,125
for self-correction, Captain.

242
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,834
There has not been a
systems-wide technological
failure

243
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,917
on a Starship in 79 years.

244
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,542
(<i> door opens</i> )

245
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,041
Excuse me, Captain

246
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,250
but Dr. Stubbs
is waiting outside.

247
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:29,709
Captain, I'm sure you have
everything under control.

248
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,542
I'd just like to know
what's going on.

249
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,542
Of course, Doctor.

250
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,291
Sit down.

251
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,125
Counselor.

252
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,291
Commander La Forge
is attempting repairs

253
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,500
even as we speak.

254
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:42,792
Attempting?

255
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:45,542
That doesn't sound
particularly reassuring.

256
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,250
Doctor, if at all possible

257
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,375
we will continue
this mission as planned.

258
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:53,208
Captain,
if we miss our chance now

259
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,083
we don't get another
for two centuries.

260
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,250
There will be many questions
asked by Starfleet

261
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,250
if the<i> Enterprise</i> fails
in its duty.

262
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:05,500
Hmm. Nevertheless, my first
and foremost consideration

263
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:09,083
will be to ensure the safety
of this ship and its crew.

264
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,542
Ensure the safety, Captain?

265
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:15,667
Or are you really talking
about playing it safe?

266
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:19,875
My dear Doctor,
in our current position

267
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:21,625
when that star explodes,
you will get

268
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:24,542
to watch your experiment
from the inside out.

269
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,875
I would rather die than leave.

270
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:30,250
I don't believe you speak
for the majority of the crew.

271
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,625
Dr. Stubbs

272
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:35,041
I know
how much this means to you...

273
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,542
My dear Counselor,
no insult intended

274
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:42,000
but please turn off
your beam into my soul.

275
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,041
I will share
the feelings

276
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,875
I wish to share.

277
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:54,417
Well, if we do not leave
in time, so be it.

278
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:58,291
It's one sure way into
the record books, eh?

279
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,542
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

280
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,333
His nonchalance

281
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,417
is studied and practiced.

282
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,709
Mm-hmm.

283
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,959
Even my sensory perception
picked that up.

284
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,917
He's put his entire self-worth
on the line

285
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,750
with this experiment.

286
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,333
He's telling the truth

287
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,500
when he says
he'd rather die than leave.

288
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,166
Call up the cross-section

289
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,625
of computer core processor 451.

290
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,917
I want to see elements
0200 to 0300.

291
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,083
Aye, sir.

292
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,250
In order to get some power

293
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,875
I had to bypass
the computer core

294
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:38,500
essentially hot-wire
the connection.

295
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,458
Whoa, whoa, right there.

296
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,959
Look at that lesion.

297
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,583
No wonder we're
coming apart at the seams.

298
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,125
It's definitely some kind
of continuing disintegration

299
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,458
but, from what,
I can't tell you.

300
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,000
And I haven't the slightest idea
how to stop it.

301
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,208
It's just a mechanical problem
though, right?

302
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,083
Increase magnification,
factor 50.

303
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,041
I don't know, Wes,
but looking at it...

304
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,208
You know, if I
didn't know any better

305
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,667
I'd say somebody
had climbed in there

306
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:05,875
and started
taking it apart.

307
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,125
Guinan.

308
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,000
I didn't think
anyone would be here.

309
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,500
I've never been
any good at being
confined to quarters--

310
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,417
as my husbands
will attest to.

311
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,709
What's that?

312
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,458
I'm just setting traps.

313
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,083
I run a clean place.

314
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,083
I know.

315
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,417
It's not that.

316
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,750
It's...

317
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,542
I'm scared, Guinan.

318
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,083
I think that everything
that's been going wrong

319
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,375
might be my fault.

320
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:22,333
You want to tell me about it?

321
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,417
I've been working
on my final project

322
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,000
for advanced genetics.

323
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,291
It's on nanotechnology.

324
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,625
I've been studying the nanites

325
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,959
we have in the Sick Bay
genetics supplies.

326
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,959
They're these little tiny robots

327
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,500
with gigabytes
of mechanical computer memory.

328
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:38,709
They're designed
to enter living cells

329
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,000
and conduct repairs.

330
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,125
They're supposed
to remain confined to the lab.

331
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,667
Are you saying
there are nanites loose?

332
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,333
Two of them, that's all.

333
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,333
I just wanted to see

334
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,291
how they would interact
and function in tandem.

335
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,208
See, in my experiment,
I had proposed a theory

336
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,917
that, by working together,
they could combine their skills

337
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,166
and increase their usefulness.

338
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,625
It was working.

339
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,667
So you made better nanites.

340
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,500
I was pulling an all-nighter
to collect my final data.

341
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,333
I fell asleep

342
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,834
and, when I woke up, I saw the
container had been left open.

343
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's just a science project.

344
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:21,291
You know, a doctor friend
once said the same thing to me.

345
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,709
Frankenstein was his name.

346
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,709
They're really harmless.

347
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,583
I mean, they're equipped with
only the most basic of skills.

348
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,959
It's almost impossible
they could be responsible.

349
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,333
Almost.

350
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,959
Dr. Crusher to Wesley Crusher.

351
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,166
Go ahead.

352
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,959
I stopped
by your quarters, Wes.

353
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,542
I assumed you'd be there
since you're off duty.

354
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,792
I know, I just had
some things to do.

355
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,583
Orders are orders, Mr. Crusher.

356
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,875
On my way.

357
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,959
You won't tell anybody,
will you?

358
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,583
I know--<i> I</i> will.

359
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:02,750
If it's true.

360
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:07,583
Wes, do you think you're going
to get a good grade?

361
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,291
I always get an "A."

362
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,709
So did Doctor Frankenstein.

363
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,166
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

364
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,250
<i>Our computer core</i>

365
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,583

367
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,875
<i>We have engines back</i>

00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:28,875

369
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,583
<i>But without a reliable computer</i>

370
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,917
<i>Dr. Stubbs' experiment</i>

371
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,750
Manual restart sequence.

372
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,166
LA FORGE:
Manual restart successful.

373
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,792
Impulse engine functions
all appear normal.

374
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:40,959
Proceed.

375
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,333
Shuttle Bay 2,
open hangar door.

376
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,375
Aye, sir.

377
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:45,875
(<i> warning Klaxon sounds</i> )

378
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:49,000
The door did not respond.
Repeating sequence.

379
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:54,041
(<i> "Stars and Stripes Forever"</i>
<i>plays loudly</i> )

380
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,583
What in heaven's name...?

381
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,083
DATA:
It is "Stars and
Stripes Forever," sir

382
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,375
by John Philip Sousa

383
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:02,250
an American composer
of band music

384
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,375
in the early 20th century...
PICARD:
Yes, yes

385
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:06,875
I know that.
Computer,
shut off the music.

386
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:10,375
Music is on all
communications channels, sir.

387
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,583
Weapons, power,
communications--

388
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,583
we're being stripped
one system at a time.

389
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,291
Shut off the power
to the Bridge.

390
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,500
(<i> music stops</i> )

391
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:22,083
Commander La Forge

392
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,458
can you get us
out of this star system safely?

393
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,333
No!

394
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,291
Not now, Doctor.

395
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,458
LA FORGE:
I'll try, Captain.

396
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,625
I don't want to overload
the engines.

397
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:31,750
Do it gently.

398
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,000
But do it.

399
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,750
We'll circuit in auxiliary power
to the Bridge.

400
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:39,417
Somehow, we'll silence Sousa
if he decides to play an encore.

401
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,208
The priority is to find out
who or what is doing this.

402
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:48,166
Number One, the Bridge,
such as it is, is yours.

403
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,625
The Egg that
Stubbs laid.

404
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:01,458
No one will say that.

405
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,333
Nobody will say
anything at all, Wesley.

406
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:09,458
We will not even
be mentioned.

407
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,458
I could live
with failure...

408
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,583
Well, maybe not.

409
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:19,458
But never even to try,
to miss your one chance at bat.

410
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,875
Do you know baseball?

411
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:23,792
Yes, my father taught it to me
when I was young.

412
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:27,583
Once, centuries ago,
it was the beloved

413
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,750
national pastime
of the Americas, Wesley.

414
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,667
Abandoned by a society

415
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:36,542
that prized fast food
and faster games.

416
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:40,166
Lost to impatience.

417
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,875
But I have seen

418
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:46,000
the great players
make the great plays.

419
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,125
Do you recreate them
on a holodeck?

420
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,875
No...

421
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:52,542
in here.

422
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,709
With the knowledge
of statistics--

423
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,709
runs, hits and errors

424
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,208
times at bat, box scores.

425
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,208
Men like us do not need

426
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,166
holodecks, Wesley.

427
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:13,959
I have played seasons
in my mind.

428
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,458
It was my reward to myself

429
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,041
for patience.

430
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:23,083
Knowing my turn would come.

431
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:26,083
Call your shot.

432
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:29,500
Point to a star.

433
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:32,625
One great blast

434
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:36,375
and the crowd rises.

435
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:41,917
A brand-new era in astrophysics

436
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:46,291
postponed 196 years...

437
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,875
on account of rain.

438
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,500
(<i> beeping short beeps</i> )

439
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,709
(<i> beeping short beeps</i> )

440
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,709
(<i> long beeps</i> )

441
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:30,875
We have to talk.

442
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:34,083
You really look
like you could use
some rest, Wesley.

443
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,834
I know.

444
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,542
It's okay, really.

445
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:42,208
No, it's not okay.

446
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,583
Really.

447
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,166
Look, Mom

448
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,959
I'm just checking
some traps that I set

449
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,667
to see if I can find out
what's happening

450
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:49,834
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

451
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,250
On someone's orders?

452
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:54,166
We're running out of time
for Dr. Stubbs.

453
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,667
You can't put everything on
your shoulders, Wesley.

454
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:58,500
Even when you're off duty,
you're on duty.

455
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:01,041
Mom, you don't understand.

456
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,834
You are a 17 year old.

457
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:06,750
I am also an acting officer
and I have responsibilities.

458
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:09,959
I'm beginning to think

459
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,834
maybe you've taken on
too many responsibilities.

460
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,792
Look, I have done everything

461
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:16,709
that everyone has asked
of me, and more.

462
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,750
And how can you know?

463
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,375
You haven't even been here.

464
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,917
I'm here now, Wesley.

465
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:38,208
Come on, I'll help you.

466
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,792
What are you looking for?

467
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,875
Wesley.

468
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,166
I think I've made
a horrible mistake.

469
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:04,583
DR. CRUSHER:
Nanites--

470
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,917
tiny machines built
from the atom up.

471
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,417
Designed for exposure only

472
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:11,250
to the inside of nuclei
during cellular surgeries.

473
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:12,333
Until then,

474
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,041
they are kept
tightly contained

475
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,417
in a non-functioning state.

476
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,542
These are not
ordinary nanites.

477
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:21,834
No, they have evolved.

478
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:26,792
Evolved? How does
a machine evolve?

479
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:28,500
It's true.

480
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:31,125
I am responsible
for this.

481
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:34,792
I allowed two
of the nanites to interact

482
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:35,959
for a school project.

483
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,208
I wanted to increase
their capabilities

484
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,458
and they escaped.

485
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,750
School project?

486
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:45,625
Just how far have
these things evolved?

487
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:48,917
Well...

488
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,375
this is a sample

489
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:53,709
of linear memory crystal
from our computer core.

490
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,000
It's like candy to them.

491
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,375
CRUSHER:
As you can see,
they're able

492
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,458
to mechanically
replicate themselves.

493
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,834
It is conceivable
that with each new generation

494
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,667
they enhance
their own design.

495
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:16,917
The rate of evolution
would be extraordinary.

496
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:19,583
How many generations
are we dealing with here?

497
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,750
Engineering, display

498
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:26,125
computer core
processor 451

499
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,208
element 0299.

500
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:32,875
Increase magnification
factor 1,000.

501
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:39,375
Can it be possible they
know what they're doing?

502
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:41,041
Why would they attack us?

503
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,166
Why does a mosquito
bite your ear?

504
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,709
And who cares?

505
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,959
The answer is simple--
call an exterminator.

506
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,625
Dr. Stubbs,
these nanites are now working

507
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:55,041
with a new,
collective intelligence.

508
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,542
Operating
together.

509
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:00,166
Teaching each other new skills.

510
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,750
Oh, really.

511
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:04,333
I'm sorry,
but this is nonsense.

512
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,208
You can't have
a civilization

513
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,625
of computer
chips.

514
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,000
They're made
in a plant

515
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:10,542
in Dakar, Senegal.

516
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:13,500
I've watched
the construction.

517
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:18,709
Then how do you explain
what we've just seen here?

518
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,333
It's no more mysterious
than watching a strain

519
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:24,208
of Leutscher virus
reproduce itself.

520
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:28,333
And that, at least,
is a<i> bona fide</i> life-form.

521
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:31,458
How many disease
germs and viruses

522
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,875
have you destroyed
in your time, Dr. Crusher?

523
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:36,792
Dr. Stubbs, I cannot exterminate

524
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:39,750
something that may
or may not be intelligent.

525
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,166
My good Captain...

526
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:44,125
There's still time.

527
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,542
Ensign, will you work
with Mr. Data

528
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:49,542
to try to remove
them safely?

529
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:53,208
If things get worse,
we'll use stronger measures.

530
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:18,208
Gentlemen, I need a computer
that is 100 percent

531
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,834
in less than eight hours.

532
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:23,166
And we still have core
reconstruction to consider.

533
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:25,250
We're trying
low gamma bursts.

534
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:27,333
We think it may slow down
their productivity.

535
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,542
Have you considered
a high-level charge?

536
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:32,667
High level gamma radiation
will kill them, Doctor.

537
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:35,125
I know.

538
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:40,750
I can't get the story
of Gulliver out of my head--

539
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:43,375
overpowered by Lilliputians.

540
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:45,417
How long do we have to wait?

541
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,417
We can continue
to bypass the part

542
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:48,959
of the computer
that's affected

543
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,750
but if the nanites
are spreading

544
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:52,875
through the
whole ship...

545
00:29:54,750 --> 00:30:00,792
(<i> gas hissing</i> )

546
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,417
Do you smell a change in...?

547
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:03,875
(<i> coughing</i> )

548
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:05,083
What...?

549
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:12,458
Picard to La Forge.

550
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,709
We have an environmental
system malfunction

551
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,291
on the Bridge.
Acknowledge.
Aye, sir.

552
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:18,458
Nitrogen oxide--
toxic levels.

553
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,625
LA FORGE:
Working on it, Captain.

554
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:22,542
(<i> Bridge crew coughing</i> )

555
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,166
I've switched to manual control
of the air handling system.

556
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:43,500
Mr. Worf, report.

557
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,333
He entered
a computer access room

558
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:47,250
and sterilized one
of the processors

559
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:48,542
with gamma radiation.

560
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,500
DATA:
The nanites in
the upper core

561
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:52,250
are all dead, Captain.

562
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,458
You have no choice now.

563
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,667
It is a matter of survival.

564
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:07,500
Dr. Stubbs, if you were
a member of my crew, I would...

565
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:09,917
But I am not a member
of your crew, sir.

566
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,375
I am a representative

567
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,792
of the highest command
of the Federation

568
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:17,625
which has directed you
to perform my experiment.

569
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,625
If any man, woman or child
on this ship

570
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:23,417
is harmed as a result
of your experiment

571
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:24,792
I will have your head

572
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:27,458
before the highest command
in the Federation.

573
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,125
Good lord.

574
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:33,041
You are talking about machines
with a screw loose.

575
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:35,709
Simply turn them off
and be done with them.

576
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,458
DATA:
Dr. Stubbs

577
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,250
your own actions have provided
evidence to the contrary.

578
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,834
When you destroyed
the nanites in the core

579
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:47,125
they responded by interfering
with our life-support systems.

580
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,750
It is difficult to accept these
as random actions

581
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,875
by machines with loose screws.

582
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:54,709
In effect, you may have proven
that the nanites

583
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,583
do have
a collective intelligence.

584
00:31:56,625 --> 00:32:00,125
Captain, the ship
is at risk.

585
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:03,166
Extermination may be
our only alternative.

586
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,083
Good point.

587
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,208
Lieutenant Worf,
I want Dr. Stubbs

588
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,417
confined to his quarters
until further notice.

589
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,166
Mr. Data, can you
find me some way

590
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,792
to communicate
with these things?

591
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:31,208
With intelligence, there is
the capability of language

592
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,333
but it will depend
on how far

593
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:34,250
their evolution
has brought them.

594
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:37,959
We could modify the
circuitry in the
universal translator

595
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,709
to make it capable of
communications with them.

596
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,792
Proceed.

597
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,291
(<i> door chimes</i> )

598
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:02,083
May I come in?

599
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:05,458
You just can't resist,
can you, Counselor?

600
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:10,083
I only want to help.

601
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:12,792
Yes, yes--

602
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:14,792
to break the shell

603
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:18,583
to get in touch
with my true feelings.

604
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:22,917
I'm only worried about
your state of mind, Doctor.

605
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:26,125
All right, Counselor.

606
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:29,083
What is it
that has you so worried?

607
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:31,083
Your single-mindedness.

608
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:33,917
Your need to have
this experiment work.

609
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:35,834
But it will.

610
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,291
Picard has no choice now.

611
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,375
He must defend
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

612
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:47,792
Counselor,
when this is all over

613
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,709
I will show you New Manhattan

614
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,834
on Beth Delta I, as you
have never seen it

615
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:56,166
and we will laugh
over glasses of champagne.

616
00:33:56,208 --> 00:34:01,458
Your self-portrait
is so practiced, so polished.

617
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,000
Yes, isn't it, though?

618
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:08,458
It's stretched so tight
the tension fills this room.

619
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,125
And if you
finally fail

620
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:15,417
I fear it will snap.

621
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,875
A good try, Counselor.

622
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,792
But sometimes

623
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:29,709
when you reach beneath
a man's self-portrait--

624
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,208
as you so eloquently put it--

625
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,250
deep down inside,
what you find...

626
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,875
is nothing at all.

627
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,834
Lockman on first.

628
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:17,250
Dark on second.

629
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:20,291
Thompson at the plate.

630
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,166
Branca on the mound...

631
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,959
(<i> sounds of crowded stadium</i> )

632
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,208
(<i> crack of a hit</i> )

633
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,458
(<i> crowd cheering</i> )

634
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,041
(<i> electronic zapping</i> )

635
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:33,875
(<i> zapping</i> )

636
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,458
(<i> zapping</i> )

637
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:44,458
(<i> equipment powering down</i> )

638
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:50,959
(<i> screams</i> )

639
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,667
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

640
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,542
He's coming around.

641
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:13,792
I cannot believe
this was an arbitrary attack.

642
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:16,375
Has Data made any progress
in contacting them?

643
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:19,291
Picard...

644
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:22,959
you must protect me.

645
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,083
Kill them.

646
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:39,583
Commander Riker

647
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:42,041
on my signal, we
will gamma irradiate

648
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:44,250
all the computer systems
throughout the<i> Enterprise.</i>

649
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:48,041
Let's put an end
to this conflict.

650
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:52,667
Worf, prepare to activate
gamma pulse generators.

651
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:54,500
(<i> beeping</i> )

652
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:57,291
Electromagnetic scanners
ready, Captain.

653
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,917
Captain.

654
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:15,458
I have established contact.

655
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,041
As we continue, Captain
they are virtually

656
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,250
learning the concept
of communication.

657
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:31,667
Each new generation
is making modifications.

658
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:32,959
Can we actually
talk to them, yet?

659
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,875
I believe it is worth
an attempt, sir.

660
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,291
Commander Riker,
bring Dr. Stubbs to the Bridge.

661
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:45,500
I don't think
this is a wise idea.

662
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:47,875
They have already
tried to kill me once.

663
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:50,750
One sure way into the
record books, Doctor.

664
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:56,208
DATA:
I am ready, sir.

665
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,375
PICARD:
Tell them that the human

666
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:59,208
who destroyed
their comrades is here

667
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,417
and wishes
to address them.

668
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:01,625
Captain, if I may...

669
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:03,834
And you, sir, you will
explain your error

670
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,417
and apologize and pray
that we can

671
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:08,125
negotiate a peace
we can all live with.

672
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,542
Is that clear?

673
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:13,542
Captain, if a face-to-face
negotiation

674
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,959
would be helpful
I would like to

675
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,959
volunteer myself
as a conduit.

676
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,709
Yourself, Data?

677
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,583
I can easily furnish the nanites
with a schematic design

678
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,792
of my neurological structure.

679
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,583
Entering my neural
network would require

680
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,542
no more than their
most basic skills.

681
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:29,959
That's what they
were designed for.

682
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,709
They could penetrate
the molecular fabric

683
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,917
of my hand-covering
into my nerve circuitry

684
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:37,583
and interface with
my verbal program.

685
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,291
If they have control
of a Starfleet Commander

686
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,291
they become
an even greater threat.

687
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:46,000
How can we be sure that we
can get them out of you?

688
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:47,959
It would be a
considerable risk, sir

689
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,250
but it would also represent
a gesture of trust on our part.

690
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:53,250
It could be an important step
toward peace, sir.

691
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:58,458
All right, Data,
propose it to the nanites.

692
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,166
The answer is yes.

693
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:14,542
They are ready, Captain.

694
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,500
Proceed.

695
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,792
<i>You are very...</i>

696
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:56,250
<i>strange... looking creatures.</i>

697
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,542
In our travels

698
00:39:57,583 --> 00:40:00,000
we have encountered
many other creatures

699
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:03,000
perhaps even stranger-
looking than ourselves

700
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:05,917
but we try to coexist
peacefully with them.

701
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:07,709
<i>Why did you attack us?</i>

702
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,000
We misinterpreted
your actions

703
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,417
as an attack on us.

704
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:14,375
<i>We were...</i>

705
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:17,041
<i>seeking raw materials</i>

706
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,041
<i>for our replicating process.</i>

707
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,792
Yes, but you
endangered this vessel

708
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:22,959
in which we all travel.

709
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,125
You nearly killed
a crew member.

710
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,291
<i>We meant no harm.</i>

711
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,375
<i>We were...</i>

712
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,667
<i>exploring.</i>

713
00:40:33,709 --> 00:40:35,500
I understand.

714
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:38,625
We are also explorers.

715
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:43,375
We mean no harm
to any other living creature.

716
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:48,583
I am the one responsible

717
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:51,417
for the deaths
in the computer core.

718
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:53,208
<i>We know...</i>

719
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,875
<i>who you are.</i>

720
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:59,917
I deeply regret
the incident.

721
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:03,083
I am a scientist on
an important mission.

722
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:06,208
Your colleagues'
exploration of
the memory core

723
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,667
put our mission at risk.

724
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:09,709
I was only trying
to protect

725
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:14,792
a lifetime of work
from being destroyed.

726
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:17,542
I am at your mercy.

727
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:20,709
<i>What is "at your mercy"?</i>

728
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,667
He asks
your forgiveness.

729
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:28,333
This conflict was started
by mistakes on both sides.

730
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:31,834
Let's agree to end it
here and now.

731
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:33,208
<i>We...</i>

732
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:37,542
<i>agree.</i>

733
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:43,542
I pledge we will
do everything possible

734
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:46,333
to assist your
continued survival.

735
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:48,208
<i>Thank you.</i>

736
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,959
<i>But we have evolved</i>
<i>beyond any need</i>

737
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,375
<i>for your assistance.</i>

738
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:59,458
<i>This ship is too confining.</i>

739
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,750
<i>We require relocation.</i>

740
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:05,709
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

741
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,000
<i>Dr. Stubbs'</i>
<i>has used his influence</i>

742
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:09,834
<i>to have planet Kavis Alpha IV</i>

743
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:13,750
<i>designated the new home</i>
<i>of the nanite civilization.</i>

744
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:16,709
<i>Commander Data's neural network</i>
<i>has been vacated.</i>

745
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,542
<i>He has been returned to us</i>
<i>unharmed</i>

746
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:21,333
<i>and with the help</i>
<i>of the nanites</i>

747
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,750
<i>our computer core</i>
<i>has been reconstructed</i>

748
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:26,291
<i>in time for the experiment.</i>

749
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:33,250
Ten seconds to
stellar blast, sir.

750
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:36,125
We're at 40 million kilometers
from the neutron star, sir.

751
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,458
Hold your position.

752
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:00,417
Doctor?

753
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:23,959
Do you have
any children, Guinan?

754
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,291
A lot.

755
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:28,000
Ever had any trouble
relating to them?

756
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:30,291
Just one.

757
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,333
One?

758
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,834
He wouldn't
listen to anybody.

759
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:36,500
Well, they all
go through that.

760
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:40,375
Not in a species
of listeners.

761
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,917
Did he grow out of it?

762
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:44,792
It took several
hundred years

763
00:43:44,834 --> 00:43:46,667
but I managed
to bring him around.

764
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:47,709
How?

765
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,417
A mother shapes her child

766
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:52,417
in ways
she doesn't even realize.

767
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:55,125
Sometimes just by listening.

768
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,041
Cute couple.

769
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:08,583
See? Now, that is healthy
for a boy his age.

770
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,000
I mean that as a doctor,
not as just a mother.

771
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:15,333
Ah, it is so good to see him
having fun for a change

772
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,750
with an attractive
young woman

773
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:19,959
who obviously
looks at him

774
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
with extraordinary

775
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:25,333
affection.

776
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:27,875
What do you know
about this girl?
