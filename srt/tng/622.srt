1
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:08,125
(<i> door chimes</i> )

2
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

3
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,583
<i>( beeps )</i>

4
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,250
<i>( sighs )</i>

5
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,917
All right. Come in.

6
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,458
Guinan.
What's wrong?

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,709
I need a doctor.

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,500
Geordi beat me in
straight sets today.

9
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:42,458
I think I've developed
tennis elbow.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,375
Well, you better go
to Sick Bay.

11
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,250
I think Dr. Selar
is on duty.

12
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,625
I don't want
to see Dr. Selar.

13
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:49,917
I always see you.

14
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:51,959
I'm very particular
about my doctors.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,625
Well, you better
get a new one

16
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:56,041
because I'm not a doctor
on this ship anymore.

17
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,583
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

18
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,625
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

19
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,458
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,417
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

21
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:47,041
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

22
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:51,291
<i>to boldly go where</i>
<i>no one has gone before.</i>

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,583
Three days on a shuttle
to Starbase 23,

24
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,291
a transport
back to Earth...

25
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,917
I can hear
Admiral Brooks now

26
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,250
telling me how
I've disgraced
Starfleet Medical.

27
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,875
Then, a leisurely
day and a half

28
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,583
before the formal
inquiry begins

29
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,208
and my career ends.

30
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,959
Beverly...

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,041
my elbow.

32
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,750
Your elbow.

33
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,709
Let me see it.

34
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,667
Does this hurt?

35
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,417
Ow! Yes,
right there.

36
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,583
That's tennis elbow,
all right.

37
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,959
Here. Hold your arm
like this.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,083
You know,
I've never been to
a formal inquiry.

39
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,750
Well, I'll see if I can
arrange one for you.

40
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,166
All you have to do
is disobey orders,

41
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,250
violate medical ethics

42
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,917
and cause an
interstellar incident.

43
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,208
Well, I guess
that<i> would</i> do it.

44
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,959
Make a fist.

45
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,417
Do I have to hit you
with my fist

46
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,166
before you tell me
what happened?

47
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,250
It all started
when those scientists
came on board.

48
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,917
No. It started
when I got curious.

49
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,125
Well, there's nothing
wrong with that.

50
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,917
That's why I went to
the Altine conference.

51
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,250
I'd heard about a new
subspace technology,

52
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,709
developed by a Ferengi--
a Dr. Reyga.

53
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,166
A Ferengi scientist.
Hmm.

54
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,083
His invention was based
on metaphasic fields

55
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,875
but his methodology was
completely unorthodox.

56
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,667
Well,
I like unorthodox.

57
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,250
Too bad
you weren't there.

58
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,917
Nobody else would
listen to him.

59
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,583
They all but jeered
him off the stage.

60
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,959
But I had read
his paper

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,083
and his work
was extraordinary.

62
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,917
So you gathered
all these scientists

63
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,583
to come hear
this Ferengi.

64
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,625
Yes. I hoped I could
be a facilitator.

65
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,166
I thought that if
I invited scientists

66
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,083
from various cultures
to board the<i> Enterprise</i>

67
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,542
I could sit them down
and help them

68
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,667
to understand
the value of his ideas.

69
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,792
Like a scientific
diplomat.

70
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,166
Exactly.

71
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,750
So, after persuading
the captain

72
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,291
I had to round up
as many scientists
as I could

73
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,333
from the field of
subspace technology.

74
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,875
<i>But of all the scientists</i>
<i>I invited,</i>

75
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,333
<i>only four were interested</i>

76
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,875
<i>in hearing about</i>
<i>Dr. Reyga's invention,</i>

77
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,625
<i>and I wasn't</i>
<i>altogether sure</i>

78
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:07,333
<i>that they were going</i>
<i>to be compatible.</i>

79
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,417
<i>Kurak was</i>
<i>a warp field specialist</i>

80
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,125
<i>on the Klingon homeworld.</i>

81
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,166
<i>I don't think Klingons regard</i>
<i>scientists very highly.</i>

82
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,375
<i>She always seemed</i>
<i>a little defensive.</i>

83
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,041
<i>Dr. T'pan is</i>
<i>practically a legend</i>

84
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,208
<i>in the field of</i>
<i>subspace morphology.</i>

85
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,583
<i>She's been the director</i>
<i>of the Vulcan science academy</i>

86
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,500
<i>for 15 years.</i>

87
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:29,375
<i>Her husband, Dr. Christopher,</i>
<i>came with her.</i>

88
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:31,083
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>much about him,</i>

89
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,041
<i>but he was some kind</i>
<i>of subspace theoretician.</i>

90
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:38,458
<i>Jo'bril was a Takaran,</i>
<i>the first one I'd ever met.</i>

91
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,625
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>what to expect from him.</i>

92
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:46,083
<i>And then there was Dr. Reyga,</i>
<i>the Ferengi scientist.</i>

93
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,750
You've all seen
my experimental data.

94
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,667
The metaphasic shield
<i>has</i> been proven.

95
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:53,583
Forgive
my skepticism, doctor,

96
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,792
but your claims are
somewhat extravagant.

97
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,959
Protect a shuttle
within a star's corona?

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,792
Not even your own government
believes it can be done.

99
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:04,000
That's why I've
invited you all here.

100
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,250
You have the vision
to see the potential

101
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,000
of Dr. Reyga's
metaphasic shield.

102
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,667
I need help to develop
the shield.

103
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,000
I am willing to grant
exclusive rights

104
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,250
to whoever provides
the necessary resources.

105
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,667
I think you all realize

106
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:20,417
what this shielding
process could mean.

107
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:24,083
The possibilities of exploration
and research are endless.

108
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,583
But only
if it works.

109
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,834
I'm not convinced that
this metaphasic shield

110
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,750
can withstand
either the temperature

111
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,917
or the radiation
it would be exposed to.

112
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,500
But it has-- not only
in countless simulations

113
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:41,000
but in a field test
that I conducted myself.

114
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,875
For which, of course,
we have only<i> your</i> word.

115
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:47,083
REYGA:
Are you accusing me
of falsifying my data?

116
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,875
KURAK:
You would not be
the first scientist

117
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:52,291
to manipulate experimental
data to his own advantage.

118
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:56,417
Dr. Reyga has offered
to demonstrate
his invention.

119
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,208
He's outfitted
one of our shuttles

120
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,792
with his metaphasic
shield.

121
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,542
I will take it
into the corona
of the star Vaytan.

122
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,458
That star has
a superdense corona.

123
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,750
The shuttle
would be subjected

124
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,417
to particularly
intense radiation.

125
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,333
Perhaps it would
be wise to choose

126
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,166
a star of lesser
magnitude.

127
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,667
I agree.

128
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:14,875
My own research into
solar energy transfer

129
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:18,583
suggests that Vaytan's corona
is extremely unstable.

130
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,500
What better way
to test my invention?

131
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,375
I'm not concerned.

132
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:25,500
The shield will hold.

133
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:28,250
I, for one, would feel
more comfortable

134
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,834
if someone else
flew the shuttle--

135
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,291
someone more objective.

136
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,000
JO'BRIL:
I will volunteer
for that task.

137
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:38,792
I've spent years studying
solar plasma reactions.

138
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:43,458
The thought of being able to
penetrate a star's corona...

139
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,291
it is a remarkable
opportunity.

140
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,000
I've studied
your data, Dr. Reyga.

141
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,583
I think you're on solid
scientific ground.

142
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:54,083
I do not share your
optimism, Dr. Jo'bril,

143
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,458
but if you wish
to pilot the craft

144
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,834
I would be more confident
in your assessment of
the shield than Dr. Reyga's.

145
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,208
CHRISTOPHER:
I agree.

146
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,750
At this point, we need
an impartial evaluation.

147
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,250
We'll need to be sure

148
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,917
that you're familiar with
the shuttle's controls

149
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,542
and Dr. Reyga's
modifications.

150
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,542
I am an accomplished pilot.
It will be no problem.

151
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,792
Well,
what do you think?

152
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,792
I am gratified,
Dr. Jo'bril.

153
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:20,333
And there will be
no difficulty

154
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,500
in operating
the metaphasic controls.

155
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,125
The system will activate
automatically

156
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,250
as you approach
the star.

157
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,583
CRUSHER:
Well, then,

158
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,083
we'll proceed with
the demonstration

159
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,208
at 1500 hours.

160
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,250
We'll meet
on the Bridge.

161
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,917
<i>It wasn't exactly</i>
<i>an enthusiastic response</i>

162
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,417
<i>to Dr. Reyga's technology,</i>
<i>but given the circumstances</i>

163
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,583
<i>and the scientists'</i>
<i>quarrelsome personalities</i>

164
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,000
<i>I was quite pleased.</i>

165
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,000
I thought that went well,
didn't you?

166
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,542
Thanks to you, doctor.

167
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,333
I didn't do anything.

168
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,417
This is an opportunity
I would never have
had without you

169
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,750
and I promise you,
I'll never forget it.

170
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,959
Some of the scientists
still seem a little doubtful

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,083
but after the demonstration,
I'm sure they'll come around.

172
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,667
Well, if there's
anything I'm used to
it's skepticism.

173
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:10,875
After all,
a Ferengi scientist

174
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,750
is almost a
contradiction in terms.

175
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,083
No. Don't deny it.

176
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,583
I know how the Ferengi
are regarded.

177
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,750
I still expect
the scientific community

178
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,417
to be a little more open
than they seem to be.

179
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,000
The metaphasic shield
is a breakthrough
in technology.

180
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,875
Many scientists have
tried to develop it.

181
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:31,333
It's only natural that there
would be some... resistance.

182
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,250
You mean jealousy.
I know.

183
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,625
I wondered if
that might account

184
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,542
for Dr. T'pan's
attitude.

185
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,583
She's been working
on subspace shielding
technology for years

186
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,208
and you've beaten her
to the punch.

187
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,333
I'm really not interested
in competition.

188
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,291
All I want is
to be acknowledged--

189
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,083
respected
as a scientist.

190
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,417
This invention
will finally do that.

191
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,500
CRUSHER:
<i>I figured</i>
<i>the hard part was over.</i>

192
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,667
<i>I'd stepped out on a limb,</i>
<i>and it hadn't broken.</i>

193
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,333
<i>Not bad for my first venture</i>
<i>into scientific diplomacy.</i>

194
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,500
Captain, the shuttle
has been launched.

195
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:08,125
On screen.
Open a channel.

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,125
I am one million kilometers
from the star's corona.

197
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,458
Proceeding
at 3/4 impulse.

198
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,875
I should reach it in
approximately three minutes.

199
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,291
The metaphasic shielding
has begun to form.

200
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,583
DATA:
External temperature

201
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,166
is 0.9 million Kelvins
and rising.

202
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,250
Radiation levels are
nearing 10,000 rads.

203
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,667
That should have no effect
on the shuttle cabin.

204
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,000
That's right.

205
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,250
Temperature in the cabin
is 21 degrees Celsius

206
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,917
and the radiation
levels are normal.

207
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,333
Wait. I'm reading elevated
neutrino levels in the cabin.

208
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,250
Those are from
the subspace field

209
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,125
that's encapsulating
the shuttle.

210
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,041
The levels are well within
acceptable parameters.

211
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,083
Outside temperature
is rising rapidly--

212
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,041
1.7 million Kelvins.

213
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,166
CRUSHER:
Temperature is
still 21 degrees

214
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,875
and the shield
is holding.

215
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,750
350,000 kilometers
and closing.

216
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,542
This is incredible.

217
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:08,625
I am actually
flying into a star.

218
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,750
Congratulations, doctor.

219
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,333
This is an amazing
achievement.

220
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:21,625
Radiation levels
outside the shuttle

221
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,375
are nearing 14,000 rads.

222
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,917
The temperature
inside the cabin
is still normal.

223
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:29,417
I am now fully engulfed
in the corona.

224
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,125
It's astonishing.

225
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,000
You see, doctors.

226
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,291
Metaphasic shielding
<i>is</i> a reality.

227
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,917
Dr. Jo'bril,
can you give us

228
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,417
an estimate of
the plasma turbulence?

229
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,750
(<i> beeping</i> )

230
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:46,125
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

231
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,375
Dr. Jo'bril.

232
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,125
Something's wrong.

233
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,750
What's going on,
Mr. Data?

234
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,875
Sensors indicate
an increased level

235
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:54,583
of baryon particles
in the cabin.

236
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,709
REYGA:
No.

237
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,500
That's not possible.

238
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,583
Dr. Jo'bril,
can you hear me?

239
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,208
Please respond.

240
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,917
(<i> gasping</i> )

241
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,750
Baryon levels are
continuing to rise, sir.

242
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,166
(<i> gasping</i> )

243
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,709
REYGA:
I don't understand it.

244
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,500
This shouldn't be
happening.

245
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:16,041
Mr. Worf, can you
beam him out of there?

246
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,834
The solar radiation
is interfering.

247
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,625
He must be at least
500,000 kilometers
from the star

248
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,166
before we can get
a transporter lock.

249
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,542
(<i> gasping</i> )

250
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,625
We're losing him.

251
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,959
Dr. Jo'bril, listen to me.

252
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,959
It is imperative
that you turn the shuttle.

253
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,917
Take it out
of the corona.

254
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,959
Do you understand me?

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,250
Pilot the shuttle
away from the star.

256
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,875
The shuttle is emerging
from the corona, sir.

257
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:54,000
Mr. Worf, get a lock on him
as soon as you can.

258
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,000
Beam him directly
to Sick Bay.

259
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,583
<i>At that point, the doubts of</i>
<i>the others seemed justified.</i>

260
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,041
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>what had gone wrong</i>

261
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,834
<i>or how seriously Dr. Jo'bril</i>
<i>had been injured,</i>

262
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,834
<i>but I knew this incident</i>
<i>could destroy Reyga's chance</i>

263
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,709
<i>to be accepted by</i>
<i>the scientific community.</i>

264
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,417
20cc's Inaprovaline.

265
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,291
(<i> labored breathing</i> )

266
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,417
It's not working.

267
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,875
Cortical stimulators.

268
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,834
Now.

269
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,792
(<i> raspy breathing</i> )

270
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,500
Again.

271
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:43,125
(<i> raspy breathing</i> )

272
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,291
(<i> hoarsely</i> ):
I saw...

273
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,291
...the sun.

274
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,542
(<i> long gasp</i> )

275
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,917
So that was my
first experience

276
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,875
as a scientific
diplomat.

277
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:21,792
A complete failure.

278
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:24,583
(<i> sighs</i> )

279
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,291
I don't understand.

280
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,083
No?

281
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,667
I mean, I've lost
patients before.

282
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,291
But this was different.

283
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,583
Mm-hmm.

284
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,542
You know, when you're a doctor
and you have patients

285
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,583
you're in control,

286
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,458
but when you send
somebody out on a mission

287
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,417
all you can do
is sit and watch.

288
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,166
That's what I felt...
helpless.

289
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,917
Anybody would.

290
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,875
Don't be too hard
on yourself.

291
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,417
You know, what you say
reminds me

292
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,500
of something
Jean-Luc said to me

293
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:04,542
when I was doing
the autopsy on Jo'bril.

294
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,709
<i>It was probably</i>
<i>the most puzzling autopsy</i>

295
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,625
<i>I've ever performed,</i>
<i>and the most frustrating</i>

296
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,041
<i>because Jo'bril's anatomy</i>

297
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,792
<i>was unlike any</i>
<i>I'd encountered,</i>

298
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:17,041
<i>and I've run into</i>
<i>some unusual specimens.</i>

299
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,166
How's it going?

300
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,750
I've never run into
a humanoid species
like this before.

301
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:25,417
His internal physiology
is baffling.

302
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,000
He doesn't seem to have
any discrete organs--

303
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,208
at least not in
the traditional sense.

304
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,083
Practically every system
is equally distributed
throughout the body.

305
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,709
Now, that kind
of physiology

306
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,667
should make him incredibly
resistant to any injury,

307
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,125
so whatever killed him

308
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,000
must have occurred
at the cellular level.

309
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,917
Do you have any idea
what it was?

310
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:48,417
No. Something
caused a massive,
system-wide failure

311
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,000
but I don't know what.

312
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,667
Were the solar radiation levels
high enough to kill him?

313
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,750
His exposure to the star's
radiation was minimal.

314
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,709
It's all very strange.

315
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,458
There's no apparent
cause of death.

316
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,000
Doctor,
here's the result

317
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,500
of the tissue scan
you asked for.

318
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:06,917
That's odd.

319
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,250
The rate of cellular
decay is extremely low.

320
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,792
Beverly,
the answers<i> will</i> come.

321
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:18,500
Maybe even minimal exposure
to the radiation

322
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:22,000
altered
the cellular physiology.

323
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,000
You know, you've been
at this for hours.

324
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,458
You might think
more clearly

325
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,875
if you got a good
night's sleep.

326
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,000
I can't sleep.

327
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,917
I want to find out
what killed him.

328
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:31,625
I owe that
to Dr. Reyga.

329
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:36,041
Are you doing it for
Dr. Reyga or yourself?

330
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,625
What do you mean?

331
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:40,291
You're the loneliest person
in the world right now.

332
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,500
No one can say anything,

333
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,583
no one can do
anything that will help,

334
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,041
and you think that
it will never go away

335
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,333
and you're right--
it won't,

336
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,250
but you can
get used to it.

337
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,709
I know it doesn't
feel like that now,

338
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,625
but you can.

339
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,041
<i>At the time, I was too</i>
<i>preoccupied with my problems</i>

340
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,208
<i>to understand</i>
<i>what he was saying.</i>

341
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,750
<i>I wasn't thinking about</i>
<i>the rest of my life.</i>

342
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,917
<i>I was trying to make sense</i>
<i>of what had happened</i>

343
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,750
<i>and I wasn't alone.</i>

344
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:15,583
<i>Jo'bril's death had raised</i>
<i>a lot of questions.</i>

345
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:19,166
<i>Geordi and Data were determined</i>
<i>to find out what had gone wrong</i>

346
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,000
<i>and they were busy going over</i>
<i>every millimeter</i>

347
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,125
<i>of the shuttle--</i>
<i>with Dr. Reyga's help.</i>

348
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,417
Run a diagnostic on
the EPS flow regulator.

349
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,000
The flow regulator
is functioning normally.

350
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,583
What about the field
emitter coil?

351
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,291
Has it maintained
polarity?

352
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,417
Yes, doctor.

353
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,500
The radial force
compensator?

354
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,875
I am unable to locate
any malfunctions.

355
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,375
All systems are operating

356
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,709
according to your
design specifications.

357
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,333
Did you find
anything wrong?

358
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,000
No. I don't
understand it.

359
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,750
There must be something
we've overlooked.

360
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:57,000
I found micro-crystalline
damage to the hull,

361
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,542
which confirms
that your shield

362
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,959
<i>was</i> breached by a burst
of baryonic radiation.

363
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,792
Were the levels high enough
to cause damage
to organic tissue?

364
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,125
I don't know.

365
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,959
Perhaps there was
an unexpected interaction

366
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,291
between the solar radiation
and the metaphasic shield.

367
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,583
No! That's not possible.

368
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,417
I anticipated
every contingency.

369
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,500
Then, maybe Jo'bril
ran into something

370
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,583
in the corona which
you<i> didn't</i> anticipate,

371
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,417
and your shield just wasn't
able to protect him from it.

372
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,000
My shield
was not at fault.

373
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,667
CRUSHER:
<i>Reyga seemed angry,</i>

374
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:28,667
<i>but I knew it was because</i>
<i>he was so disappointed.</i>

375
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:32,709
<i>Everything he'd worked for,</i>
<i>hoped for, was slipping away</i>

376
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,917
<i>and that made what I had</i>
<i>to do next even harder.</i>

377
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm sure
you all understand

378
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,333
that, in light of
what happened,

379
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,750
I think it would be
inappropriate

380
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,625
to continue
further testing.

381
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,875
Perhaps if Dr. Reyga
has perfected

382
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,417
his metaphasic technology
we can try again.

383
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,959
Dr. Crusher, please,
if I could have

384
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,625
a little more time
to investigate,

385
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,125
I know I could find
what went wrong.

386
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,792
But that won't bring back
Jo'bril, will it?

387
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,792
I do not believe
the shield will ever work.

388
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:04,667
Its very concept
is flawed.

389
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,917
Just one more test.

390
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:11,667
Whom do you propose
we sacrifice next?

391
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:15,959
I will pilot
the shuttle myself.

392
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,208
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,875
As chief medical officer,
I'm responsible

394
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:21,500
for the health and safety
of all the people aboard.

395
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,792
I will not authorize
any further tests.

396
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,041
Very well.

397
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,959
But I<i> will</i> prove myself.

398
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,750
<i>I couldn't help</i>
<i>but admire his tenacity.</i>

399
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:37,166
<i>He just wasn't going</i>
<i>to accept defeat</i>

400
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,709
<i>and I hoped</i>
<i>he</i> would<i> prove himself,</i>

401
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,375
<i>but that was the last time</i>
<i>I saw him alive.</i>

402
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,166
<i>We'd gone to science lab four</i>
<i>when the ship's sensors</i>

403
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,458
<i>registered a sizable</i>
<i>plasma surge there.</i>

404
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,291
Look at this--
a plasma infuser.

405
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,000
It's completely
discharged.

406
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,291
The blast must have
killed him instantly.

407
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,417
Well, perhaps
he could not live

408
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,834
with the failure
of his invention
and took his own life.

409
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,750
Or perhaps someone
just wanted it
to look that way.

410
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,834
Isn't it odd that
he could hold on so
tightly to the infuser

411
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,291
when it was discharged?

412
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,291
The normal reflex would
have been to drop it.

413
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,875
The plasma shock could have
affected his nervous system.

414
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:23,667
He may have reacted
by gripping tighter.

415
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:26,333
I'll know for certain
when I do the autopsy.

416
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,291
Is your examination
complete, doctor?

417
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,500
For now.

418
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,709
Please have his body
taken to the morgue.

419
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,375
Very well.

420
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,959
<i>I remembered his passion</i>
<i>and commitment</i>

421
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,750
<i>and his determination</i>
<i>to prove himself,</i>

422
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:45,834
<i>and I was sure that this man</i>
<i>had not taken his own life,</i>

423
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,625
<i>and if anyone could</i>
<i>understand that</i>

424
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:50,375
<i>I knew it would be</i>
<i>Captain Picard.</i>

425
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,041
I was with him
right before he died.

426
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,709
He was not suicidal.

427
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,500
But by your own admission

428
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:02,250
Reyga was a difficult man
to understand.

429
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,625
Isn't it possible that he was
simply masking his feelings?

430
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,667
I don't think so.

431
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:10,083
He was disappointed at
the failure of his device

432
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,792
and certainly he was upset
at Jo'bril's death,

433
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:16,875
but I never got the sense
that he was ready to
end his own life,

434
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:19,375
and if that's true, then
someone else killed him.

435
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:21,333
Do you have
any evidence of that?

436
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,333
Not yet.

437
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,458
But when I finish the autopsy
I hope I'll have it.

438
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,375
Beverly...

439
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,250
I'm afraid there
will be no autopsy.

440
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,959
The family have already
been contacted.

441
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,917
They insist that the body
must not be touched

442
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,375
until they perform
the Ferengi death ritual.

443
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:42,250
But there's a question as to
the circumstances of his death.

444
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,667
To the family,
that's irrelevant.

445
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:44,917
Let me speak with them.

446
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,458
Please, believe me...
they're adamant.

447
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,166
We are scheduled
to rendezvous

448
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,959
with a Ferengi vessel
in 17 hours.

449
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,333
They will pick up
Reyga's body then.

450
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,250
I'm sorry, there
will be no autopsy.

451
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,959
Jean-Luc, I cannot
just drop this.

452
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,583
Don't you see?

453
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,166
There may have been
a murder.

454
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,333
Then you will have
to find evidence

455
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,625
some way other
than an autopsy.

456
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,458
I don't understand,
doctor.

457
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,834
Isn't it pretty clear
that Reyga died

458
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,583
from a plasma
discharge?

459
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,083
It won't be clear
until after an autopsy.

460
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,000
As far as I know,
he could have been poisoned

461
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,333
and someone put
the plasma infuser

462
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,709
in his hand
after he died.

463
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,917
You think
he was murdered?

464
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:30,083
I'm not discounting
that possibility.

465
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,250
The point is,
without a complete autopsy

466
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,333
there's no way of
knowing for certain.

467
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,291
Why won't the Ferengi
allow it?

468
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,333
It has to do with
their death rituals.

469
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,834
A body can't be violated
before it's buried.

470
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,166
And apparently, the family is
more concerned about ritual

471
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,250
than finding out the truth
about how he died.

472
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,834
I just can't get
the information I need

473
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,834
from a tricorder scan.

474
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,166
Suspects.

475
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,917
If Reyga didn't kill himself,
someone else did.

476
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,208
So who are
the possible suspects?

477
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,583
Whoever had something
to gain from his death.

478
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,250
And the only ones
to fit that category

479
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,041
are the other scientists.

480
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,917
I'm afraid I don't
understand, doctor.

481
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,834
Do you have evidence
that Reyga was murdered?

482
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,417
No, but I can't believe
he took his own life

483
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:26,333
and I would like to
explore any possibilities
a bit further.

484
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,458
What reason would
anyone have to kill him?

485
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,375
I was wondering
if you might have some
thoughts along that line.

486
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:34,583
I see.

487
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,834
You are suggesting that
I had such a motive.

488
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,291
If Reyga's technology
had been successful,

489
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,000
you might have been displaced

490
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,500
as the preeminent scientist
in subspace technology.

491
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:46,792
But since it
<i>wasn't</i> successful

492
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:48,041
it isn't logical
to conclude

493
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,750
that I had such
a motive, is it?

494
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:54,250
I must say I resent this,
doctor.

495
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,917
We have all been shocked
by recent events.

496
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,500
I don't see there's
anything to gain

497
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:01,500
by dragging us through
these insinuations.

498
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:03,959
I'm just trying
to uncover the truth

499
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,250
and I need your help
to do it.

500
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,583
Have you seen
or heard anything

501
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,041
that might suggest that
someone else had a motive?

502
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,125
We are trying to forget
the unpleasantness

503
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,834
of these past
several days--

504
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,250
not have them
stirred up again.

505
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,750
I find it disturbing

506
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,792
that you would try to
foster suspicions among us.

507
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,333
Forgive me.

508
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,667
I don't mean
to upset you,

509
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:28,000
but have you noticed
anything unusual?

510
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,500
I find your question
distasteful.

511
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,750
Is there something
you're not telling me?

512
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,458
I'm sure it's nothing.

513
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,291
I was
in the storage room

514
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,083
of the science
laboratory yesterday.

515
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,583
Kurak was working
in the lab.

516
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,875
Reyga came in, and...

517
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:02,000
they got into
an... an argument.

518
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,125
About what?

519
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,750
I don't know.

520
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:10,667
I couldn't hear
anything clearly, and...

521
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,792
until they started to
shout at one another.

522
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:15,959
Then I heard Kurak
say that Reyga

523
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,750
had insulted her honor

524
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:20,917
and no Klingon
would stand for that.

525
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:23,625
I do not believe
she killed him.

526
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,959
These were words spoken
in the heat of anger.

527
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,709
Kurak is volatile...

528
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,834
passionate...

529
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:32,959
but not a killer.

530
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,834
And, doctor,
neither are we.

531
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:40,583
Thank you.

532
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,750
<i>I knew he might be right</i>
<i>about Kurak.</i>

533
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:47,583
<i>Klingons make threats</i>
<i>as a matter of course.</i>

534
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:51,792
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>sometimes they follow through.</i>

535
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:04,834
That looks like
one of Dr. Reyga's
shield configurations.

536
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,917
Yes.

537
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,542
Personal research.

538
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:17,709
Even though
this technology failed?

539
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,417
No one has denied there is
potential in the idea.

540
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:23,625
Which you're now free
to develop.

541
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,792
Are you accusing me
of something?

542
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,291
No.

543
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:33,083
But I want to know
why you threatened Dr. Reyga.

544
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:37,166
I<i> warned</i> Dr. Reyga

545
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:39,709
that if he persisted
in his slander

546
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,125
he would pay the price.

547
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,875
What was his accusation?

548
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,875
I will not repeat
his lies.

549
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,250
Were they lies?

550
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,083
Be careful, doctor.

551
00:26:55,125 --> 00:27:00,208
Insulting the honor
of a Klingon can be
extremely dangerous.

552
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,125
Did Reyga
make that mistake?

553
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,166
(<i> grunts</i> )

554
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,875
I have heard enough
of your accusations!

555
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:13,250
Now I will have
your silence!

556
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:16,583
(<i> panting</i> )

557
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,000
Well, you're going
to have to throw me

558
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,625
a lot harder than that
if you want to get it.

559
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,291
Now...

560
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,125
what did he
accuse you of?

561
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:30,625
Sabotage.

562
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,291
Sabotage of
the metaphasic shield?

563
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,667
Was that
why it failed?

564
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:35,417
How would I know?!

565
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:37,500
Did you sabotage
the project?

566
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,083
No.

567
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:44,875
I did not.

568
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,333
Good-bye, doctor.

569
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:59,834
<i>Kurak refused</i>
<i>to say anything more.</i>

570
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:03,291
<i>I wasn't sure if her silence</i>
<i>was motivated by guilt</i>

571
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,667
<i>or just Klingon pride.</i>

572
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:08,583
<i>I was beginning to find out</i>
<i>that investigating a murder</i>

573
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:12,208
<i>was a little more perilous</i>
<i>than I'd thought.</i>

574
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,041
<i>And for everything</i>
<i>I'd been through,</i>

575
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:20,208
<i>I didn't have any more insight</i>
<i>than I did before I started.</i>

576
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,834
<i>Which brought me back</i>
<i>to Reyga's body,</i>

577
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,875
<i>because the more</i>
<i>I thought about it</i>

578
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:28,166
<i>the more it seemed that</i>
<i>the answers had to be there.</i>

579
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,667
<i>DNA traces...</i>
<i>tissue anomalies...</i>

580
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,125
<i>a wealth of forensic clues</i>

581
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:35,166
<i>that could shed some light</i>
<i>on the mystery.</i>

582
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:38,041
<i>So, I made the decision.</i>

583
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,917
(<i> sighs</i> )

584
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,458
Come.

585
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,709
Beverly.

586
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,083
Jean-Luc, I want to
tell you something

587
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:25,291
that you need to know

588
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:28,250
but you're not
going to like it.

589
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,792
I did an autopsy
on Dr. Reyga.

590
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:39,291
What did you find?

591
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,125
Nothing.

592
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,500
I'm sorry.

593
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,375
I know I shouldn't
have done it.

594
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:49,333
You most certainly
should not.

595
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:52,417
I made it clear to you that
the family would not allow it.

596
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,709
Not only have you
disobeyed my orders

597
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,083
but you've interfered
in the burial rituals
of another culture.

598
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:05,750
You've put both of us
in a very difficult position.

599
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:08,041
The family will have
to be notified.

600
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:10,917
I don't doubt that
they will react strongly.

601
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

602
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,250
And if the Ferengi government
becomes involved--

603
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:17,083
as I'm certain
they will--

604
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,417
this could have
very significant repercussions.

605
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:24,166
I'm not sure how much
I can protect you.

606
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,709
You don't have to,
Jean-Luc.

607
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,500
I knew what I was doing

608
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:32,625
and I'm prepared to
accept the consequences.

609
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:41,041
<i>I could tell that he was</i>
<i>terribly disappointed in me</i>

610
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:44,333
<i>and that was almost</i>
<i>the hardest part of all.</i>

611
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,500
So that's the story.

612
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:49,125
That's how I ended
my career.

613
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,208
Backhand volley.

614
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,667
What?

615
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:55,041
That's how I did it.

616
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:57,500
Geordi kept hitting
to my backhand at the net.

617
00:30:57,542 --> 00:31:01,458
Guinan, two people
have died on this ship--

618
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,083
two lives
that ended horribly--

619
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,834
and you're worried
about your tennis game?

620
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,875
Are you upset?

621
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:08,083
I don't know--
you tell me.

622
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,667
You're supposed
to be wise.

623
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:12,500
Well, if you<i> are</i> upset,

624
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:13,959
why are you
moping around here?

625
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,166
Why don't you do
something about it?

626
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,208
I've done everything
I could think of.

627
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,542
It got me fired.

628
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,959
Do you think Dr. Reyga
killed himself?

629
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,583
No.

630
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,542
Do you think there's
a murderer on board?

631
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,667
Yes.

632
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:27,333
Then why are you
still sitting here?

633
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,041
Don't you get it?

634
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:31,041
If I start digging
around again...

635
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,583
You could be
relieved of duty.

636
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:46,667
<i>Chief Medical Officer's Log,</i>
<i>personal, Stardate 46830.1.</i>

637
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:48,041
<i>I'll be leaving</i>
<i>the ship tomorrow</i>

638
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,166
<i>to attend the board</i>
<i>of inquiry.</i>

639
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,375
<i>That means I have</i>
<i>less than 24 hours</i>

640
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,959
<i>to get to the bottom</i>
<i>of this mystery.</i>

641
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,500
What are you doing,
Data?

642
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:05,250
I am running
additional diagnostics

643
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,583
to make certain there was
no permanent radiation damage

644
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,291
to the shuttlecraft hull.

645
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,333
You've studied Dr.
Reyga's shield system.

646
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,750
Do you think it could
have been sabotaged?

647
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:19,250
There was no evidence
to support sabotage.

648
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:23,041
Just consider
the possibility.

649
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:25,792
The system interlocks prevent
access to the circuitry

650
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,542
unless the shield emitter
is active.

651
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:29,500
Any attempt
to sabotage the device

652
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:31,542
would have to be made
while the shield
is in operation.

653
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:34,250
The only time
the shield was active

654
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,083
was during Jo'bril's
test flight.

655
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,542
That is correct.

656
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:40,792
It seems unlikely that Jo'bril
would perform sabotage

657
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,458
which would result
in his own death.

658
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,750
I agree.

659
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,917
Would it be possible
to sabotage the shuttle

660
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:49,750
by remote
during the flight?

661
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:51,291
A phased ionic pulse

662
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:54,458
beamed directly
into the metaphasic
projection matrix

663
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,250
would result in a temporary
system malfunction.

664
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,625
Where on the<i> Enterprise</i>

665
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,917
could you generate
a phased ionic pulse?

666
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,875
Such a pulse could be initiated
from the lateral sensor array,

667
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:06,500
Science Labs
One, Four and 16,

668
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:08,667
or any of the Bridge
science stations.

669
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:10,250
Let's assume
for the moment

670
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:12,333
that someone did send out
a phased ionic pulse.

671
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,041
What would have happened
inside the shuttle?

672
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:17,917
A tetryon field would be
formed briefly in the cabin,

673
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:21,709
temporarily disrupting
the metaphasic shield.

674
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,291
A tetryon field.

675
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,333
If Jo'bril was exposed
to a tetryon field

676
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:30,208
it might have left
residual traces
in his tissue.

677
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,000
Thanks, Data.

678
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,625
Beverly?

679
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:50,750
Yes?

680
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:51,917
We've arranged
for the shuttle

681
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,500
to take you
to Starbase 23.

682
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:55,500
You can leave the ship
at 0700 hours tomorrow.

683
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:56,875
Thank you.

684
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:59,709
About everything that's
going on, I'm sorry.

685
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,375
I'm sure it will
all work out.

686
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:02,583
Yes, of course.

687
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,917
You know the inquiry
is just a formality,

688
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,333
and Captain Picard
will do everything
he can for you.

689
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,834
I'm sure that'll help.

690
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,667
But if you do anything
foolish before that inquiry

691
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:12,250
it's not going
to look good for you.

692
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,000
I don't know
what you mean.

693
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,250
I think you do know
what I mean.

694
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:17,834
The best thing
for you to do right now

695
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,709
is to go to your quarters
and read a good book.

696
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,500
If you do anything to
make the situation worse

697
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,625
it's going to be that
much harder on you.

698
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,792
Thank you, Commander.
Your concern is noted.

699
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:30,583
Beverly, I'm saying this
to you as a friend.

700
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,291
Yes, Will, I know,

701
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:35,333
but, as a friend,
please try to understand.

702
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,709
I can't quit now

703
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,125
and I don't want you to
become involved in this.

704
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,750
Computer, access
ship's medical logs

705
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:52,458
and download
current autopsy files.

706
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,208
COMPUTER:
Autopsy files are restricted to
active medical personnel only.

707
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,583
Access denied.

708
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:58,583
Damn.

709
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,834
Dr. Crusher?

710
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:02,667
What do you need
the autopsy files for?

711
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:07,208
Don't worry, I know
I'm not supposed to be here.

712
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,792
I'll go.

713
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,875
Computer...

714
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,875
access autopsy files.

715
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:23,375
I assume you'll need the files
on Dr. Reyga and Jo'bril.

716
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:24,667
Alyssa...

717
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:26,750
I can see how important
this is to you.

718
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,875
I don't want you
to get involved in this.

719
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,750
Is that an order,
doctor?

720
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:31,917
Yes.

721
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:34,417
Too bad you're not
my boss anymore.

722
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,375
Thank you.

723
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,000
So what do we do now?

724
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:41,125
First, I want to review
Jo'bril's physiology records.

725
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,792
Then, I want to take
another look at the body

726
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:44,709
and I want to see if
there's any tetryon traces.

727
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,125
Let's do it.

728
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:07,291
We need to run a tissue scan
at the molecular level.

729
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,458
Calibrate the scanner

730
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,291
to pick up
tetryon particles.

731
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,625
Yes, doctor.

732
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,792
Recalibration complete.

733
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:16,750
Activate the scan.

734
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:23,250
Nothing.

735
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:24,834
Let's do it again.

736
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,417
Use the enhanced-
resolution mode

737
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,291
to boost
the sensitivity.

738
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,417
There's something
in the subdermal tissue.

739
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,709
Narrow the scan field.

740
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:38,750
Tetryon traces.

741
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:41,375
Someone<i> did</i> sabotage
the shield.

742
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:43,125
That's a possibility,

743
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:46,250
but this is very
circumstantial evidence.

744
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,875
There's only one way
to know for certain.

745
00:36:57,834 --> 00:36:59,917
Captain.

746
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:01,667
I'm concerned
about Beverly.

747
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:03,375
I've tried several
times to talk to her

748
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:04,625
but she's been
avoiding me.

749
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,917
I'm not surprised.

750
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:09,083
This entire
experience has been...

751
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,166
DATA:
Captain.

752
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,458
An unscheduled launch

753
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,458
is taking place
in shuttle bay two.

754
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:18,834
No idea.

755
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:20,333
No one's filed
a flight plan.

756
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:21,875
On screen.

757
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:27,166
RIKER:
That's the<i> Justman--</i>

758
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,875
the shuttle
Reyga modified.

759
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,875
Open a hailing frequency.

760
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:40,583
Dr. Crusher, what do you
think you're doing?

761
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,917
Testing a theory, Captain.

762
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:49,792
A theory?

763
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,375
I think Dr. Reyga's
shield does work.

764
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,000
Return to the ship
immediately.

765
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,959
I'm sorry.

766
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,417
Mr. Worf, override
the shuttle's computer.

767
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,709
Return it
to the shuttle bay.

768
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,875
Aye, sir.

769
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:08,375
Sir, she has isolated
her navigational control.

770
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:11,083
It will not be possible to
establish remote operation.

771
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,417
Get a tractor beam on her.

772
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,667
WORF:
I cannot establish a lock.

773
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,333
She is too close
to the star.

774
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,041
Solar interference
is too high.

775
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,291
Mr. Data,
what is her heading?

776
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,834
Bearing 271 mark 4, sir.

777
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:24,542
She is headed
into the sun's corona.

778
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:32,250
Computer, begin monitoring
external temperature.

779
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:33,458
COMPUTER:
External temperature,

780
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,417
0.8 million Kelvins
and rising.

781
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:39,125
Beverly, what do you
hope to accomplish?

782
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:42,458
I think Dr. Reyga was
right about his shield.

783
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,792
The only reason it failed
is because it was sabotaged

784
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:46,041
and I'm going to prove it.

785
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,250
But you can't be
certain of that.

786
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,291
You're betting your life
on a hypothesis.

787
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,792
I'm not wrong.

788
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:57,291
COMPUTER:
External temperature
1.9 million Kelvins.

789
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:05,792
Sir, the shuttle
is entering the corona.

790
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:09,083
Beverly,
what's happening?

791
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,291
I'm all right.

792
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:14,834
Computer, shield status.

793
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,709
COMPUTER:
Metaphasic shield holding.

794
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,542
All systems within normal
operating parameters.

795
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,417
Congratulations,
Dr. Reyga.

796
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,333
You did it.

797
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:27,709
Captain, I want you
to post security guards

798
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,709
around the three
visiting scientists.

799
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,458
One of them<i> has</i> 
to be responsible

800
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,250
for sabotaging
the first test.

801
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:34,208
I think if we...

802
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,000
(<i> console beeping</i> )

803
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,375
Sir, we have lost contact.

804
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:49,625
Crusher to<i> Enterprise.</i>

805
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,166
I've lost you.
Come in.

806
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:55,250
CRUSHER:
<i>Justman</i> to<i> Enterprise.</i> 
Come in.

807
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:58,500
<i>Enterprise,</i> do you hear me?
Come in.

808
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:01,041
They cannot hear you.

809
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:04,041
I have severed
communications.

810
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,375
How can you be alive?

811
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:07,917
I'd think
after your autopsy on me

812
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,500
you'd know
the answer to that.

813
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:12,041
The slow rate
of cellular decay.

814
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:15,750
It is a natural result
of physiostasis.

815
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:18,083
Takarans can control
their physiology

816
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,667
at a cellular level.

817
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,208
We can create
the appearance of death.

818
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,500
In the morgue, you were
conscious the whole time.

819
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:26,959
You heard everything
we said.

820
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,875
You knew everything
we were going to do.

821
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,417
Move away.

822
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:33,208
Move away.

823
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,083
What are you doing?

824
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:45,417
I'm sending out
a transient subspace signal.

825
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:49,125
It will obscure the shuttle
from the<i> Enterprise</i> sensors

826
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:52,792
and they will interpret it
as a warp engine breach.

827
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:55,417
They will believe that
you have been destroyed.

828
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,750
I'd like
to thank you, doctor.

829
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:59,083
For what?

830
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,750
All I wanted to do
was discredit Reyga

831
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:05,917
so that no one would pursue
his technology except me,

832
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:10,458
but<i> you</i> have given me more
than I could have hoped.

833
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,333
Now I can take
the prototype itself
back to Takara,

834
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:17,000
where I will develop it
into a weapon.

835
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:20,458
All I have to do
is wait here

836
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,667
until the<i> Enterprise</i> 
is convinced

837
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:25,417
you are dead
and leaves.

838
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,625
(<i> groaning</i> )

839
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,709
(<i> groaning</i> )

840
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,166
Captain, there is
no indication of debris.

841
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:17,834
However, the subspace signal
indicates a warp engine breach.

842
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:20,875
All right.
Begin a phase-one search,

843
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:23,000
starting with
the shuttlecraft's
last known coordinates.

844
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,834
Plot a proximity course
toward the star...

845
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,917
Sir, we are picking
up an object

846
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:28,625
emerging
from the corona.

847
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:35,458
Crusher to<i> Enterprise.</i>

848
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,250
I'm all right.

849
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:39,250
Returning to the ship,

850
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:42,792
and I finally have the answers
I've been looking for.

851
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:49,750
<i>Chief Medical Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46831.2.</i>

852
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:51,208
<i>I have been reinstated</i>

853
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,291
<i>and I will be resuming</i>
<i>my duties shortly.</i>

854
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:57,333
<i>In the meantime, I have a</i>
<i>personal matter to attend to.</i>

855
00:42:58,875 --> 00:42:59,875
Hi, Guinan.

856
00:42:59,917 --> 00:43:01,959
Hello. Ooh...

857
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,208
somebody's birthday?

858
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,875
Not unless it's yours--
it's for you.

859
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:06,583
For me?
What's the occasion?

860
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,750
It's a thank-you
for giving me
a good kick in the butt.

861
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:12,250
Oh, now, I didn't...

862
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:13,667
Now, I did some research.

863
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:15,834
This is the latest design,
state-of-the-art.

864
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:19,667
It is specifically designed
to cushion all vibrations,

865
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:22,375
so you will never have tennis
elbow again.

866
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,667
Thank you, doctor.

867
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:28,500
This looks like
a great racket

868
