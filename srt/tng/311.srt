1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,375
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43489.2.</i>

2
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:09,417
<i>We have arrived at Angosia III,</i>

3
00:00:09,417 --> 00:00:12,125
<i>a planet that has expressed</i>
<i>a strong desire</i>

4
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,208
<i>for membership</i>
<i>in the Federation.</i>

5
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:17,166
<i>Prime Minister Nayrok has</i>
<i>taken Commander Riker and me</i>

6
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,667
<i>on a tour of the capital city.</i>

7
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,417
Well, I'm greatly impressed

8
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:25,583
with everything I've seen
so far, Prime Minister.

9
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:26,959
Then, I hope it will
reflect favorably

10
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:28,500
in your report, Captain.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,125
It's a tribute to your people
that you were able

12
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,166
to recover so rapidly
from the Tarsian War.

13
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,208
It is, indeed.
We are not warriors.

14
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,250
We believe reason
should settle disputes,

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,667
but not every culture
agrees with our position.

16
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,542
An unfortunate reality.

17
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,709
The development of the mind

18
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,583
the cultivation
of the intellect--

19
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,250
these are the pursuits
to which the Angosians

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,500
have dedicated themselves
for centuries.

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,166
Prime Minister?

22
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,792
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we have a problem.

23
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,834
May I see you
for a moment?

24
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:57,792
Excuse me,
gentlemen.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,166
Yes, what is it?

26
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,834
Well, I think they'll
make a fine addition

27
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:08,083
to the Federation,
Number One.

28
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,750
I'm not sure I'd like
to live in this place.

29
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,458
A little stuffy
for my taste.

30
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,959
A prisoner has escaped

31
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,000
from the penal colony
on Lunar V.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Two guards are dead.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,208
The prisoner has taken
a transport vessel.

34
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,875
Do you have means
of pursuit?

35
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,000
The tracking station
was sabotaged.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,917
The entire base is in chaos.

37
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:33,458
We've ordered ships
from the surface to follow him,

38
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,000
but to be honest,

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,667
our civilian pilots
are not trained for this.

40
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,792
With your permission?

41
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,083
Mr. Data,
a stolen transport vessel

42
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,125
has departed from Lunar V.

43
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,709
Have you picked it up
on the sensors?

44
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,291
Yes, Commander.

45
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,792
Good. Detain the vessel
and quarantine the pilot.

46
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:53,125
Is he armed?

47
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,792
Yes, and extremely dangerous,
Commander.

48
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:58,417
Lunar V
is a maximum security facility.

49
00:01:58,417 --> 00:01:59,792
Did you read that, Data?

50
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:00,959
Yes, sir.

51
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,166
We will use extreme caution.

52
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,625
Keep us informed.

53
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,959
Riker out.

54
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,542
On screen, sir.

55
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:11,208
DATA:
Specifications
on the vessel, Mr. Worf.

56
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,667
No warp drive.

57
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,375
Minimal weaponry.

58
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,125
Heading, Mr. Crusher.

59
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,500
319 mark 250, sir.

60
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,417
Vessel speed increasing
to .02 impulse.

61
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:24,375
He's seen us, Data.

62
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,125
That's the ship's
drive section.

63
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,959
What happened to the rest
of his ship?

64
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,625
Scan the drive section
for life-form readings.

65
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,041
None.

66
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,417
Bring us around

67
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,500
to the back side
of the asteroid, Mr. Crusher.

68
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:59,333
Sensors indicate wreckage
on the asteroid surface, Data.

69
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,041
No life signs.

70
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,667
Apparently, he did not survive.

71
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,834
Data, the drive section...

72
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:08,542
where'd it go?

73
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:11,625
There's no sign of it
on its previous heading.

74
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,208
Someone must be at the helm.

75
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,834
RIKER:
Status report, Mr. Data.

76
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,792
I am afraid the prisoner
has eluded us, sir.

77
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:24,834
Eluded the<i> Enterprise?</i>

78
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:57,000
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,041
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

80
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,917
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

81
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:06,959
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

82
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,458
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

83
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,917
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

84
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,959
We followed procedures
precisely, Captain.

85
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,625
Scanners indicated
no life-forms present

86
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,959
in the drive section.

87
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,250
I cannot explain
how he escaped.

88
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,709
Incoming message from
the Angosian Prime Minister.

89
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,083
On screen.

90
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,834
Captain, we've identified
the prisoner.

91
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,959
His name is Roga Danar.

92
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,208
His criminal record
is too long to go into,

93
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,875
but I must caution you

94
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,750
that he is given to bouts
of uncontrollable violence.

95
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,625
I appreciate your warning,
Prime Minister.

96
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,959
We will keep you informed
of our progress.

97
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,792
Geordi, how far and how fast
can that transport ship travel?

98
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:54,625
Without warp drive,
there's no way

99
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,417
he could be out
of our range by now.

100
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:58,000
WESLEY:
We've been sweeping
the area constantly, Commander.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,792
There's nothing
within sensor range.

102
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,083
Cloaking device?

103
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,834
Sir, the Angosians have
no cloaking technology.

104
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,709
Unless he's
borrowing one.

105
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:08,542
Hmm?

106
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:09,959
If he's hanging
over the planet's pole,

107
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,667
the magnetic field
would confuse our sensors.

108
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,875
Commander, I believe I can
recalibrate our sensors

109
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,500
to read through
the electromagnetic interference

110
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,750
over the poles.

111
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,750
RIKER:
Let's try it,
Mr. Crusher.

112
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,625
Realign for polar orbit.

113
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,375
Aye, sir.

114
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,458
DATA:
There he is, Commander.
You were correct.

115
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,083
This guy knows all the tricks,
doesn't he?

116
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,250
Still no life-form readings
coming from the vessel.

117
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,333
Could it be
the magnetic interference, Data?

118
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,583
I have compensated.

119
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,917
Still no reading.

120
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,250
We'll have an answer shortly.

121
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,583
Lock on a tractor beam,
Mr. La Forge.

122
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,375
Tractor beam locking on, sir.

123
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,500
He is coming about, sir.

124
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,417
He's out of his mind.

125
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,917
Sensors detect
a massive power buildup

126
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,208
in his aft thrusters.

127
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,458
On main viewer.

128
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,792
He's making a suicide run.

129
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,917
Shields have been
automatically activated.

130
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:11,583
Tractor beam disengaged.

131
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,333
He bounced off the shields.

132
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,417
That's an interesting twist.

133
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,750
Mr. Crusher, fix coordinates
onto that vessel.

134
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,792
We'll just beam
the whole thing

135
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,291
into a shuttle bay
if we have to.

136
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,542
I do not believe
that will be
necessary, Captain.

137
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,208
He is no longer in
the drive section.

138
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,250
What?

139
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,792
I anticipated

140
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:37,333
that diversionary tactic
based on his pattern to date.

141
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,083
We are picking up
a cylindrical object

142
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,875
approximately seven meters
in length

143
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,542
and three meters
in diameter.

144
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:45,542
WORF:
On screen.

145
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,792
PICARD:
Magnify.

146
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,792
An escape pod.

147
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,834
This guy's incredible.

148
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:56,750
Yet there are still
no life-form readings.

149
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,417
Transporter Room 4,

150
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,041
prepare to beam aboard
from inside that shuttle

151
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,458
anything large enough
to be a humanoid adult.

152
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,917
O'BRIEN:
Aye, sir.

153
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:08,083
Security team, report
to Transporter Room 4.

154
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,875
CREWMAN:
On our way, sir.

155
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,667
We're holding the contents
in stasis

156
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,208
pending the arrival of security.

157
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,875
(<i> beeping</i> )

158
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,208
An illicit weapon
has been detected

159
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,417
in the transporter beam, sir.

160
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,667
It's been rendered inoperable.

161
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,625
Worf, let's greet our guest.

162
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,917
SECURITY CREWMAN:
Bring him in, Mr. O'Brien.

163
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,083
Just stay where you are.

164
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:43,166
O'BRIEN:
More security,
Transporter Room 4.

165
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,792
More security!

166
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,208
More security!

167
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,667
(<i> grunts</i> )

168
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,625
(<i> screams</i> )

169
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,834
(<i> groans</i> )

170
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,625
Oh...

171
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:24,083
(<i> grunts with effort</i> )

172
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,417
Get him to
a detention cell.

173
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:44,417
Set phasers
on maximum stun!

174
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,542
(<i> beeping</i> )

175
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:49,083
O'BRIEN:
Commander...

176
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,291
We'll need a few hours
to get the containment field

177
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,542
on Lunar V operational
before we pick him up.

178
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:09,125
The damage he did during
his escape was considerable.

179
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,500
We will await
your signal.

180
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,250
I appreciate your patience.

181
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,583
The prison psychologist
recommends

182
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,417
that you keep Danar
fully sedated

183
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,083
until he's ready for transport.

184
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:22,625
Hmm... Well, he's in our highest
security detention area.

185
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,667
There shouldn't be
any more problems.

186
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,583
Do not relax your security
for an instant, Captain.

187
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,917
He is extremely violent
and very cunning

188
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,500
as you already know.

189
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,041
I will send a transport vessel

190
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,875
to pick him up
as soon as possible.

191
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,083
Nayrok out.

192
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,959
Have you run
a diagnostic

193
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,542
on the
sensors, Data?

194
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:41,917
Yes, sir. There is nothing wrong
with the ship's sensors.

195
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:44,291
The reason
we did not pick up life signs

196
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,792
aboard the escape vessel
is because the prisoner

197
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,583
has no life signs.

198
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,792
Computer, identify the occupant
of the detention cell.

199
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:55,583
COMPUTER:
The detention cell
is vacant at this time.

200
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,166
He's in there.

201
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,125
Could he be some kind
of android?

202
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,792
Our sensors can identify
artificial life-forms, sir.

203
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:06,417
Apparently, he is capable
of deceiving the sensors.

204
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,792
(<i> startled yell</i> )

205
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,000
(<i> groaning</i> )

206
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,250
(<i> groaning continues</i> )

207
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,709
(<i> moaning</i> )

208
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,041
Are you all right?

209
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,834
What is this ship?

210
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:01,250
You're onboard
the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

211
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,291
A war vessel?

212
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,458
A Federation starship.

213
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,500
Federation.

214
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,709
We were
orbiting Angosia

215
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:16,208
when you escaped
from Lunar V.

216
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:25,667
Well, it seems that I am
the victim of my own bad timing.

217
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,834
(<i> water splashes</i> )

218
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,667
Are you the keeper of this jail?

219
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,667
I'm Deanna Troi,
Ship's Counselor.

220
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,333
Counselor?

221
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,709
Too bad.

222
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,625
I'd rather you were the jailer

223
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,333
to keep me company
during my return trip.

224
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,125
I assume we
are returning

225
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,417
to Lunar V.

226
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,458
That terrifies you.

227
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:05,291
I just killed three men
to get out of there, Counselor,

228
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,625
and I'm fully capable
of killing you as well.

229
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,667
That's a terrifying thought,
isn't it?

230
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,834
Even to me.

231
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,458
Do they mistreat you there?

232
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,250
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Not at all.

233
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,500
I am comfortable,
well fed, and housed.

234
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,250
Oh, no, the Angosians take
good care of their prisoners.

235
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,083
It's simply a matter
of never being able to leave.

236
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,208
What about you, Counselor?

237
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,250
Do you always visit
the prisoners?

238
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,750
Are you a specialist
in criminal behavior?

239
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,291
Or am I just an
interesting specimen
who landed on the ship

240
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,458
like an insect to be studied
under your microscope?

241
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,875
Why do have all this anger
toward me?

242
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,041
A girl with long dark hair

243
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,375
broke my heart a long time ago.

244
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:02,083
Out of bitterness
and resentment...

245
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,959
I turned to crime.

246
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,375
(<i> laughing</i> )

247
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,542
How about this one--

248
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:14,709
my mother abandoned me
when I was a little boy.

249
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:18,166
I never got the guidance
that a wild young man needed.

250
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,834
Why are you doing this?

251
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:21,250
Playing games?

252
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,083
Isn't that what you do,
Counselor?

253
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,250
Isn't that what all of you
mind-control experts do?

254
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,041
I am not a mind-control expert.

255
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:33,125
I came here because
I sensed you were in pain.

256
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:36,667
And what do you sense now?

257
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,250
The pain is gone.

258
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:47,208
That's interesting, isn't it?

259
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,667
TROI:
There's a duality
about the man.

260
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,417
It's hard
to describe.

261
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:53,458
He's aware
of his crimes.

262
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,583
In fact,
they trouble him deeply.

263
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,375
Counselor...

264
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,166
He's intelligent, thoughtful,
typically Angosian.

265
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:04,875
I know what he's done,
but when I'm with him,

266
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,750
I cannot believe
that he is randomly

267
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,750
and deliberately violent.

268
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,250
In fact,

269
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,375
inherently, he has
a nonviolent personality.

270
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,542
Counselor, it took five men
to restrain him

271
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,792
and he took apart half
the transporter room

272
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,125
in the process.

273
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,250
I'm not opening
the door for him, Captain.

274
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,041
I can only tell you
that I sense

275
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,542
something very unusual
about him--

276
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:31,834
something that is not inherent
to a criminal personality.

277
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,792
In a few hours,
I'll be turning him over

278
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,250
to the Angosians,
and I'll be happy to do it.

279
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,125
I understand.

280
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:52,458
Data, do we
have a linkup

281
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,291
with the Angosian
central computer?

282
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,041
Yes, Counselor.

283
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,583
We are copying records
for Federation inspection

284
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,583
pursuant to their
application for admittance.

285
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:05,125
Can I see a police record
on Roga Danar?

286
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,291
DATA:
There is no police record.

287
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,542
That's impossible.

288
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:12,875
He's been in prison.

289
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,792
Lunar V is
a military prison facility.

290
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:17,333
Military?

291
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,750
He's a soldier?

292
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,166
That may provide
an explanation

293
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,542
for the tactics
he was able to use against us

294
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:28,208
when we tried
to capture him.

295
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,959
It doesn't say here
what he was arrested for.

296
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:36,166
Call up his
military record.

297
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:40,000
DATA:
He served in many campaigns
during the Tarsian War,

298
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,083
received two promotions
to the rank of "subhadar"--

299
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,875
A very honorable tour of duty.

300
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

301
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,166
What was this man's crime?

302
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,083
I've learned

303
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,792
you are
a soldier.

304
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,750
I was a soldier.

305
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,083
Why were you put in prison?

306
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,125
Obviously because
I am a threat to society.

307
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,000
There's no police record.

308
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,834
What did you do?

309
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:19,125
Everything they asked me to do.

310
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,417
That's why I became
such a threat.

311
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,917
I don't understand.

312
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,458
Why are you bothering to try,
Counselor?

313
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,875
Because I want to help if I can.

314
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,917
Unlock the door.

315
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,417
You are a nonviolent man,

316
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:39,583
yet you committed acts
of excessive violence.

317
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,834
You can learn to do it
if you have to.

318
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:46,375
Did you have to?

319
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,917
It was war.

320
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:51,166
So it started with the war.

321
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,291
It started the day
I volunteered, Counselor,

322
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,000
the day I began training,

323
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,166
the day I met
my first instructor,

324
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,291
and he also called himself
a "Counselor."

325
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:14,125
Roga Danar was
an idealistic young man

326
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,000
who answered his people's call
to service.

327
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,875
He joined the military

328
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,083
to help fight
for the Angosian way of life.

329
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,083
What he didn't realize
was that, by doing so,

330
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,709
he would have to give up
that way of life forever.

331
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:29,917
He's not the same man
who left home to go to war.

332
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:33,542
He's been through intense
psychological manipulation

333
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,750
and biochemical
modifications.

334
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,208
At Troi's request,
I examined him.

335
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,375
His cell structure
has been significantly altered.

336
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,625
They used a combination
of cryptobiolin,

337
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,250
triclenidil, macrospentol,

338
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,375
and a few things
I can't even recognize.

339
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,709
Was he a prisoner of war?

340
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:50,041
Who did this to him?

341
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,500
His own government.

342
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,625
He's been programmed
to be the perfect soldier.

343
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,834
He can be absolutely normal,
but when a danger is perceived,

344
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:02,750
the programming clicks in
and takes over.

345
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:08,417
Memory, strength, intelligence,
reflexes-- all become enhanced.

346
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:11,250
He's conditioned
to survive at any cost.

347
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,417
One of the new substances
in his cellular structure

348
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:17,375
even shields
electrical impulses.

349
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,333
Perhaps that would explain why
our sensors did not detect him.

350
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:25,166
Why was he assigned
to the Lunar V facility?

351
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,083
He committed no crime.

352
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,208
He says he was ordered there
with others like him.

353
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,583
When the first soldiers
returned to Angosia,

354
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,041
they had trouble.

355
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,583
The rules changed too quickly.

356
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,250
A lost temper
could result in murder.

357
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,166
DATA:
Counselor,
did no one attempt

358
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,583
to adjust their programming?

359
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,917
They were just exiled
to Lunar V.

360
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:52,583
Lunar V...
an orbiting gulag.

361
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,834
What do you want?

362
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:05,625
Am I disturbing you?

363
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,709
Yes!

364
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,083
Then I will leave.

365
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,291
No, wait, wait.

366
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,625
I'd rather talk
to someone.

367
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,667
Why do you have yellow eyes?

368
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,417
I am an android.

369
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,834
I believe you and I have
something in common.

370
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,792
We do?

371
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,834
Yes. We have both
been programmed.

372
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:29,250
Ah, yes, yes, you've been
talking to Counselor Troi.

373
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,250
It is not at all
the same, android.

374
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,000
I do not mean to belittle
your condition.

375
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,041
I understand your dilemma,

376
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,792
but I am curious.

377
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:41,166
My program can be altered.

378
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,458
Yours cannot?

379
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,875
The man I was is still
inside me,

380
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,250
but this... this conditioning
has been imposed--

381
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,583
woven together with my thoughts

382
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,834
and my feelings
and my responses.

383
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:57,625
How do you separate
the program from the man?

384
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,208
Without further analysis
of your condition

385
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,500
from Counselor Troi
or Dr. Crusher,

386
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,250
I cannot say,

387
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,959
but I believe
it is possible.

388
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,583
Yeah, doctors.

389
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:12,291
The Angosian doctors
did this to me.

390
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,542
If it could be undone,
wouldn't they undo it?

391
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:18,667
I cannot answer that.

392
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,583
Nor can I.

393
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:27,750
Yet I ask myself that question
every moment of every day.

394
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,375
Captain, what this man
has been telling you

395
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,583
is full of half-truths.

396
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,834
He's a prisoner.

397
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,208
What do you expect him
to say about us?

398
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,834
Well, perhaps you would
clarify it for me.

399
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:40,792
The soldiers were resettled
on Lunar V.

400
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,959
It was to be their colony.

401
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:46,208
Was it a resettlement
of their choosing?

402
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,500
It was for their own protection,
as well as that of others.

403
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Most of them
are quite happy there.

404
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,208
We went to great lengths to give
them a fine quality of life.

405
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,542
Prime Minister,

406
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:58,709
even the most comfortable prison
is still a prison.

407
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:00,291
Unfortunately,

408
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,041
a few agitators like Danar
forced us to add security.

409
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,083
My medical team suggests

410
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:09,208
that there may be
alternative treatment.

411
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,625
Captain, I assure you

412
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,709
that every alternative
has been explored,

413
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:14,291
and this discussion

414
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,083
is now treading upon matters
of internal security.

415
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,667
This is not your concern.

416
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:21,333
I have dispatched a ship
to rendezvous with you

417
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,792
to transport the prisoner
back to Lunar V.

418
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:26,583
On behalf of Angosia,
I thank the Federation

419
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,583
for its assistance
in retrieving our citizen.

420
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:37,542
"Matter of internal security"--

421
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:41,542
the age-old cry
of the oppressor.

422
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:44,709
Were you built for combat,
android?

423
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:47,792
No, but my program does include
military strategy.

424
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:50,542
That is how I was able
to anticipate your final tactic

425
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:51,709
and capture you.

426
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:53,375
You did that?

427
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,792
Perhaps you would be

428
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:56,750
better at combat than you think.

429
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,959
Except that I am
not programmed to kill.

430
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:04,917
My improved reflexes have
allowed me to kill 84 times,

431
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,625
and my improved memory

432
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:11,959
lets me remember
each of those 84 faces.

433
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:15,333
Can you understand
how that feels?

434
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:18,417
I am incapable of any feeling.

435
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:20,834
Why, then, I envy you.

436
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,000
(<i> door opening</i> )

437
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:29,625
Roga, this is
Captain Picard.

438
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,917
Captain.

439
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:33,667
Mr. Danar,
I am transferring you

440
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,875
to Angosian security.

441
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,208
They're en route.
They will arrive shortly.

442
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,875
I wanted to tell you
I have no choice.

443
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:45,458
The Prime Minister insisted,
and we have no right to refuse.

444
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,291
Well, you would be foolish

445
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,333
to consider it otherwise,
Captain,

446
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,375
for they are very correct.

447
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,166
I am dangerous.

448
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,792
There is no place for me
in a civilized society.

449
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:58,291
I do not believe that.

450
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,500
Nor do I.

451
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,542
I respect my officers'
judgments.

452
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,291
I wish I could help further.

453
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,542
If a way appears, I will.

454
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:10,500
I appreciate you telling me
that face to face.

455
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,083
I thought you deserved
that much.

456
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,542
And you deserve
to know

457
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:16,208
that I must use
whatever means I can to escape.

458
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:20,959
WORF:
Captain, the Angosian
transport vessel has arrived.

459
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,208
Inform them the transport
will take place shortly.

460
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,625
Picard out.

461
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,625
Mr. Data, to the Bridge, please.

462
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,291
Take care of
yourself, android.

463
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,709
I enjoyed our talk.

464
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,542
I, too.

465
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,250
Perhaps when this planet

466
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,959
becomes a member of the
Federation, we'll be able...

467
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,125
I will not
be there

468
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,458
to see it, Counselor

469
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:53,834
because even with this
overwhelming demand to survive

470
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:56,625
that they have built
into my soul,

471
00:24:56,625 --> 00:25:01,125
I would rather die
than return to Lunar V.

472
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,500
Captain Picard, we're ready
to receive the prisoner.

473
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,000
Now transmitting the coordinates
of our holding cell.

474
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,375
(<i> beeping</i> )

475
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,542
Coordinates received, sir.

476
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:26,250
Stand by
for transport.

477
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,291
Picard out.

478
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:31,500
Mr. Worf, have all security
precautions been taken?

479
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,917
Release of the force field

480
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:34,417
and activation
of the transporter

481
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,083
will be virtually simultaneous.

482
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:39,125
There will only be a .1 second
difference between them.

483
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:41,333
Even Danar can't
move that fast.

484
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,834
There will be

485
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,709
a full security contingent
present.

486
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,250
Proceed.

487
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,667
Transporter Room One
to Lieutenant Worf.

488
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:59,208
We're ready, sir.

489
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,959
Energizing.

490
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,917
WORF:
O'Brien, increase
transporter power.

491
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:14,750
I'm losing him.

492
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,125
TROI:
Roga, don't!

493
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,500
You'll be killed!

494
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:22,458
(<i> explosion</i> )

495
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,917
What the hell...?

496
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:29,166
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

497
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,291
Security personnel--
full alert.

498
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:39,667
Shut down all
shuttle bays,

499
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,000
transporters,
and turbolifts.

500
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,667
WORF:
Captain, a phaser is missing.

501
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,083
We must assume that he is armed.

502
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:49,375
Sound general quarters.

503
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,125
Clear all corridors
of nonessential personnel.

504
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,208
We don't want him
taking any hostages.

505
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,875
General quarters sounded, sir.

506
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:58,000
Raise security containment
fields immediately

507
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,458
on decks 34, 35, and 36.

508
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,083
Aye, sir.

509
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:03,750
Data, put
the turbolifts
back on line.

510
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,500
If Danar sees
they're operating,

511
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,875
he may try to use them.

512
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,291
As soon as he does,
we have him.

513
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:42,291
Sir, unauthorized access
of turbolift five on deck 34.

514
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:43,917
He took the bait.

515
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:46,166
Data, override its
destination.

516
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,458
Divert that turbolift
to a position near

517
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,750
to Lieutenant Worf's
present location.

518
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,291
Four seconds to arrival, sir.

519
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:58,291
We're in position.

520
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:03,417
(<i> electronic shrieking</i> )

521
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:04,834
Phaser on overload!

522
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,375
Seal this deck!

523
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:11,000

524
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,542
(<i> shrieking stops</i> )

525
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:22,417
WORF:
Captain, the overload
has been averted.

526
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,291
(<i> grunts and yells</i> )

527
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,542
(<i> beeps</i> )

528
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:38,041
Drop force field on deck 36.

529
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:46,458
Sir, containment field down
on deck 36.

530
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,709
How the hell did
he manage that?

531
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:50,709
He's headed for Engineering.

532
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:53,125
Riker to La Forge.

533
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,917
Engineering, respond.

534
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:57,375
Engineering?

535
00:28:57,375 --> 00:29:00,542
Engineering, come in.

536
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,500
Geordi, are you okay?

537
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,500
Captain, someone
in Engineering

538
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,083
is attempting to override
the security system lockout.

539
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,542
Riker to Worf.

540
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:19,834
He's in Engineering.

541
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:21,583
Acknowledged, Commander.

542
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:23,417
We're on our way.

543
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:25,417
Data, I want you
to stall Danar.

544
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:27,041
Allow him to think
he's succeeding.

545
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:29,125
As he bypasses each subsystem,

546
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:32,000
I can reroute it
without his knowledge.

547
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,834
Make it so.

548
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,625
Danar is extremely adept, sir.

549
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:41,750
I am not certain

550
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,250
which security measure
he is attempting to circumvent.

551
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,583
Sir, Danar
has succeeded

552
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:49,917
in restoring power
to Shuttle Bay 2.

553
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,500
I have overridden
Danar's bypass.

554
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,667
Shuttle Bay 2 is
once again inactive.

555
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,291
Very good, Mr. Data.

556
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:21,250
Now I know
where he's headed.

557
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:39,333
You okay?

558
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,083
Geordi!

559
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:44,959
I'm all right.

560
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:48,166
He took us by surprise.

561
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:49,750
He came out of nowhere.

562
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,125
I didn't think<i> anyone</i>
could move that fast.

563
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:55,250
DATA:
Lieutenant, I am reading
an open panel--

564
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,333
K-12, J-9, deck 30.

565
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,750
Acknowledged.

566
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,542
Danar must have climbed
up the reactor core

567
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,291
and gotten into
a Jefferies tube.

568
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,458
He could be anywhere.

569
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:07,458
We believe he is attempting
to reach Shuttle Bay 2.

570
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:09,458
That's 25 decks
up from here--

571
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:12,375
quite a climb,
but I wouldn't
put it past him.

572
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:15,458
There is a full contingent
of security at all Shuttle Bays.

573
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,083
You want my advice?

574
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,667
Double it!

575
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:30,750
(<i> beeping</i> )

576
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,709
Captain, reading another
open access panel.

577
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,417
Security team
to Jefferies tube J-4, deck 15.

578
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:40,041
Security, acknowledged.

579
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:50,041
Deck 15-- a few decks
below the Shuttle Bay.

580
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,667
Sir, I find it highly unlikely

581
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:54,250
that Danar would be attempting
to reach Shuttle Bay 2.

582
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,375
Explain.

583
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:56,834
In our previous
encounter,

584
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,875
Danar employed a strategy
of misdirection

585
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,125
in an attempt
to gain his objective.

586
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:04,041
And you believe he's using
the same tactic now?

587
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:06,083
He is aware that our sensors
are unable to track him,

588
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,834
yet he seems to be purposely
leaving a trail

589
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:09,250
for us to follow.

590
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,041
Where do you think
he's headed?

591
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:15,542
I am afraid his true destination
remains a mystery.

592
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,625
Readings now indicate
an open access panel

593
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:28,417
in Jefferies tube
N-11, deck 38.

594
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,041
He's doubled back on us.

595
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:32,041
The cargo bays.

596
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:36,208
Advise all personnel on deck 38
to stay out of the cargo bays.

597
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:37,583
DATA:
Aye, sir.

598
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,917
PICARD:
Status, Mr. Data?

599
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:57,667
They appear to be empty, sir.

600
00:32:57,667 --> 00:33:02,208
Good. I want you to flood them
with anesthizine.

601
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,250
DATA:
Aye, sir.

602
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:10,125
(<i> loud hissing</i> )

603
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,834
(<i> equipment powering up</i> )

604
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,625
Sensors show anesthizine
concentration

605
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,375
70 parts per million

606
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,583
within the
cargo bays.

607
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:31,917
That should put our boy
to sleep.

608
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:34,959
Return environmental conditions
to normal, Mr. Data.

609
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:39,208
Move in your security teams,
Mr. Worf.

610
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,792
Acknowledged.

611
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,250
Worf to Bridge.

612
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,625
We have found no sign
of the intruder,

613
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,667
but there is
a missing pressure suit

614
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:18,917
from Cargo Bay 3.

615
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:20,583
Pressure suit?

616
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:22,291
RIKER:
Could be he's planning
to enter Shuttle Bay 2

617
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:23,667
from outside the<i> Enterprise,</i>

618
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,500
bypassing
the security guards.

619
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,542
Mr. Worf, post security guards
at all emergency airlocks

620
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,417
on decks 37 through 39.

621
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:34,250
Aye, sir.

622
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,917
I'll also cover
the photon torpedo launchers.

623
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:39,792
Danar may attempt
to leave the ship that way.

624
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:41,083
Worf out.

625
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,083
WORF:
Danar!

626
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,583
You are cunning.

627
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:07,083
You must have Klingon blood,

628
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:09,250
but the battle is over.

629
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:12,000
My battle is never over.

630
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,667
Worf to Bridge--

631
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,208
I have Danar.

632
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,834
Explosion in Jefferies tube,
section T-95.

633
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:33,417
All external sensors
inoperative.

634
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,083
Go to backup systems.

635
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:38,834
Unable to transfer control, sir.

636
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:41,083
(<i> both grunting and groaning )</i>

637
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,583
(<i> beeping</i> )

638
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,208
Sit down, gentlemen.

639
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,375
(<i> groaning</i> )

640
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:41,166
(<i> equipment powering down</i> )

641
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,542
Worf to Bridge.

642
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:45,750
RIKER:
Go ahead.

643
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,458
Danar has escaped.

644
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:50,542
He used a phaser
to power the cargo transporter.

645
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,041
Coordinates indicate

646
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:55,125
he beamed aboard
the Angosian transport ship.

647
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,333
Data, can you verify that?

648
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:59,959
Negative, sir. All
external sensors

649
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:02,000
still nonfunctioning.

650
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:06,458
Then we have no way
to track him.

651
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,417
That was his plan all along.

652
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,834
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

653
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:21,083
<i>We are continuing to repair</i>
<i>damage to the ship's sensors</i>

654
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:24,041
<i>following the escape of</i>
<i>the Angosian prisoner Danar.</i>

655
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,875
<i>He is still at large.</i>

656
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:27,917
Engineering, I'm getting
readings on tactical.

657
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:29,250
Are we back up?

658
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,917
LA FORGE:
That's affirmative, Commander.

659
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,709
Mr. Worf, sweep the area.

660
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,625
Captain, the Prime Minister
is hailing us, priority one.

661
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:38,166
On screen.

662
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,750
WORF:
Priority channel cleared.

663
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,333
Yes, Prime Minister?

664
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,166
Captain, I've just been informed

665
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:46,834
that Roga Danar has attacked
the penal colony on Lunar V.

666
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,500
Attacked it?

667
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,166
In our own police shuttle.

668
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,333
Several of my people
have been wounded.

669
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,208
Hundreds of prisoners
are rioting.

670
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,083
Some of them have escaped
with Danar

671
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:58,125
and, at last report, are headed
toward the capital city.

672
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:01,834
Captain, we are not suited
to handle situations like this.

673
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:04,166
That's what we created<i> them</i> for.

674
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:07,875
We'll send an away team,
Prime Minister.

675
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,291
Picard out.

676
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:12,208
Counselor Troi,
Commander Data, Mr. Worf--

677
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,834
you will accompany me
to the planet.

678
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,500
And my understanding is

679
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,333
that these men
are programmed to survive.

680
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,542
Is that correct?

681
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:31,917
Yes, Captain.

682
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:33,583
And that they
will not kill

683
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:35,500
unless their survival
is at stake.

684
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,000
It is against their
nature to do so, Captain.

685
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,375
Then let us hope they
do not believe their
survival is at stake.

686
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,375
Mr. Worf...

687
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:52,417
You are personally responsible
for the Captain's safety.

688
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,792
I understand,
Commander.

689
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,834
(<i> talking quietly</i> )

690
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:06,542
I don't expect them
to listen to reason.

691
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:09,333
I loathe the idea
of a violent confrontation,

692
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:11,250
but we must
be prepared.

693
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,166
(<i> whoosh of beam down</i> )

694
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,166
MAN:
Is that it?

695
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:20,959
MAN 2:
I don't know.

696
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,917
This is all you've brought?

697
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,625
Where are
your security men?

698
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:26,542
We're not here
to fight your wars for you.

699
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:27,917
They have been seen

700
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,500
moving towards
the center of the city.

701
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,875
People are scared.

702
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,709
Don't you understand, Captain?
They're dangerous.

703
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:34,041
<i>You</i> are dangerous.

704
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,250
They're only victims.

705
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,583
You made them what they are.

706
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,333
You asked them
to defend your way of life

707
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,458
and then you discarded them.

708
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,750
They were not happy here.

709
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,417
They were not welcome here.

710
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:45,834
It was the will of the people
to resettle them.

711
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:48,000
No one was pleased
with the solution,

712
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,166
but we had to act
for the greater good.

713
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:51,667
DATA:
Prime Minister,

714
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:54,625
if you have the skills to
create a master soldier,

715
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,834
can you not counteract
the effect?

716
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:59,333
The chemicals can be removed
from their systems,

717
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,041
but we're not convinced

718
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,917
that the psychological
conditioning

719
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,875
can ever be entirely reversed.

720
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,792
Have you tried, sir?

721
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:08,208
We studied it thoroughly.

722
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:10,041
Even before the training began,

723
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,375
we knew there would be
problems reversing it.

724
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,542
It was a risk we had to take.

725
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:15,834
Did you reveal that risk

726
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:17,500
to the men who volunteered
for service?

727
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,625
We were helping them
to survive the war.

728
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,000
You understand?

729
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,125
They needed
those skills.

730
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,041
They're your brothers,
your sons,

731
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,375
and you turned your backs
on them.

732
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:30,667
TROI:
There are methods
of treatment.

733
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,166
Until you try them,

734
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:34,041
how can you know
they won't work?

735
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:37,083
Even a partial recovery
could give them some peace.

736
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,083
It was the will of the people.

737
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,750
To allow them to suffer?

738
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,083
PRIME MINISTER:
There was a referendum.

739
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:46,166
The people weighed
the costs involved.

740
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:48,417
They chose
the settlement solution.

741
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:51,458
Besides, we may need
to use them again someday.

742
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:52,917
Have you understood one
word that we have said?

743
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,083
ANGOSIAN:
Move in.

744
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,166
Freeze!

745
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,291
Nobody move!

746
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,542
No, Worf!

747
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,333
All of you--
don't respond.

748
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:04,792
Don't provoke them further.

749
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:06,041
Keep those weapons down

750
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,834
unless you wish
to be killed.

751
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:12,959
Do as he says.

752
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:14,166
No!

753
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:15,542
Don't.

754
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:16,750
Shoot us.

755
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,709
Destroy us.

756
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,333
Do what you have to,

757
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:22,792
but you will not ignore us.

758
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,083
Come on, do it!

759
00:41:38,834 --> 00:41:40,375
You cowards.

760
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,166
Yes, and you're not programmed
to murder cowards.

761
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:46,208
So if they will not fight back,
what will you do?

762
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:49,792
We will not go back.

763
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:51,375
You were programmed
to survive.

764
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,917
You can survive at
the Lunar V settlement.

765
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:56,291
To survive is not enough.

766
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:59,458
To simply exist is not enough.

767
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:04,166
Roga, tell them what you want.

768
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:08,959
We want our lives back.

769
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:12,291
We want to come home.

770
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:14,166
I am not prepared

771
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:16,542
to negotiate
under threat, Danar.

772
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,166
But if you will
put down your weapons

773
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:24,125
and return peaceably
to Lunar V...

774
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:27,208
I would be willing.

775
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:31,625
Mr. Prime Minister,
with all due respect,

776
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:36,750
you will have to force us
or at least try.

777
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,333
Captain, you must
do something.

778
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,917
Call your ship.

779
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:43,792
Quite right,
Prime Minister.

780
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:47,417
<i>Enterprise,</i> prepare to beam
the away team back.

781
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:49,291
RIKER:
At your command, Captain.

782
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:50,792
Picard, you can't

783
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:52,291
leave us
like this.

784
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:54,917
I have all the information
I need for my report.

785
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:57,041
Your prisoner has
been returned to you

786
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,959
and you have
a decision to make--

787
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:00,792
whether to try
and force them back

788
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,750
or welcome
them home.

789
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,375
In your
own words--

790
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:06,166
this is not
our affair.

791
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,750
We cannot
interfere

792
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,125
in the natural course of
your society's development,

793
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,333
and I'd say it's going
to develop significantly

794
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:16,834
in the next few minutes.

795
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,959
It's been an interesting visit.

796
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,875
When you're ready
for membership,

797
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:26,500
the Federation will be pleased
to reconsider your application.

798
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,959
Mr. Riker,

799
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:30,375
four to beam up.

800
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,208
RIKER:
Aye, sir.

801
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,333
Success, Captain?

802
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,917
Number One,

803
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:59,000
will you note in our report

804
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,375
that if the government
of Angosia survives the night,

805
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:05,083
we will offer them
Federation assistance

806
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:08,208
in their efforts
to reprogram their veterans.

807
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:11,125
And if the government
doesn't survive?

808
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:14,333
I have a feeling
they will choose to.

809
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:17,834
Mr. Crusher,
set coordinates

810
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:20,166
for Starbase
Lyra III.

811
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,750
Coordinates set, sir.

812
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:24,834
Engage.
