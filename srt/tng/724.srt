00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:05,333
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47941.7.</i>

2
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:08,166
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is en route</i>
<i>to a briefing on the situation</i>

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:11,542
<i>in the Demilitarized Zone</i>
<i>along the Cardassian border.</i>

4
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:15,959
<i>Meanwhile, we are celebrating</i>
<i>the return of an old friend.</i>

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,250
LA FORGE:
Ro!

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,959
Welcome home.

7
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:28,583
Thanks. It's good
to be back.

8
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,625
Congratulations
on your promotion, Lieutenant.

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,625
Oh, and same to you,
Commander.

10
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,125
Thank you.

11
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,792
Say, I understand that
advanced tactical training

12
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:37,000
is a real picnic.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,375
Right.

14
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,917
Did you see
the buffet?

15
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:43,250
This is real
Bajoran<i> foraiga.</i>

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,375
It wasn't
easy to get.

17
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,458
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble, really.

18
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,667
CRUSHER:
We wanted you to know how glad
we are to have you back.

19
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,792
TROI:
So, um...

20
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,291
Where are your
new quarters?

21
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,291
Uh, Deck Four,
Section Eight.

22
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,417
What are you
planning to do...?

23
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,458
PICARD:
Lieutenant Ro.

24
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,458
Go ahead, sir.

25
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,250
Please report to the Bridge.

26
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,375
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,542
Excuse me.

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,792
Captain.

29
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,667
You seemed a bit overwhelmed
by all the attention.

30
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,750
Well, to tell you the truth

31
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,458
I-I really want
to see everyone.

32
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,291
I would just rather
do it one at a time.

33
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,917
Well, you look
very fit, Lieutenant.

34
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:32,917
Tactical training
seems to agree with you.

35
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:34,542
Well, you know me.

36
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:36,041
I enjoy a challenge.

37
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,583
That school is more
than a challenge.

38
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,417
Half the class
washes out every year.

39
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:40,625
Although somehow

40
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,834
I didn't think you
would be one of those.

41
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,709
Captain...

42
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,750
I want you to know

43
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,792
that I really appreciate
your recommending me.

44
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:52,792
If it weren't for you,
my life would be

45
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:54,834
a very different
one right now.

46
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,375
RIKER:
Bridge to Picard.

47
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,500
Go ahead.

48
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,125
We're receiving
a distress signal

49
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:04,208
from a Cardassian ship
near the Demilitarized Zone.

50
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,667
Change course
to intercept.

51
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm on my way.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,458
I, um... I'd like you
at the conn, Lieutenant.

53
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:15,500
(<i> alarm wailing</i> )

54
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,667
Ensign Gates?

55
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,208
Report.

56
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,417
The Cardassian ship
relayed a distress signal

57
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:24,041
but it was cut off before we
could find out what was wrong.

58
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,375
I have the ship
on long-range sensors.

59
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,959
It appears to be under attack
by several small ships.

60
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,000
Can you identify them?

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,375
Uh, no, sir.

62
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,959
They're not transmitting
identification codes.

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,333
I will scan their
warp signatures.

64
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,917
Sir, sensors indicate
the attacking vessels

65
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:40,792
are Federation ships.

66
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,083
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

67
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,834
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

68
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,959
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

69
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,792
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

70
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:30,250
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

71
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,583
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

72
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,250
We're coming
into visual range.

73
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,583
On screen.

74
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:45,417
RIKER:
Those<i> are</i> Federation ships.

75
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,875
Isolate one
and magnify.

76
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,125
The Maquis.

77
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,417
Open a channel.

78
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,166
Open.

79
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,792
To all Maquis ships,
call off your attack

80
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:01,208
or we will be forced
to engage you.

81
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,834
No response.

82
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,917
You are Federation
citizens.

83
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:08,000
Your actions
are in violation

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,041
of our treaty with
the Cardassians.

85
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,291
Call off your attack.

86
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,375
DATA:
They are not responding, sir.

87
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,583
Mr. Worf, are we
in firing range?

88
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,542
Not yet, sir.

89
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:22,083
Arm phasers and
photon torpedoes

90
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,500
and stand by.

91
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,417
I never thought we'd be firing
on our own people

92
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:27,000
to protect
a Cardassian ship.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,333
The Maquis ships
are regrouping, sir.

94
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,583
They are closing in
on the Cardassian vessel.

95
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,333
The Cardassian shields
are down to 30%.

96
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,208
They may not be able
to withstand another hit.

97
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,875
Sir, we are
within weapons range.

98
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,834
Mr. Worf, can you
detonate a torpedo spread

99
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:42,166
<i>between</i> the Maquis ships
and the Cardassians?

100
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,166
Yes, sir.

101
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,542
Do it.

102
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:53,041
The Maquis are
breaking formation.

103
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,083
They are withdrawing.

104
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,750
Signal the
Cardassians

105
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,583
that we're standing
by to assist them

106
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,166
if they have
any wounded.

107
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,583
Aye, sir.

108
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:09,667
Do you people
have experience

109
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,125
treating Cardassians?

110
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,875
Yes.

111
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you mind?

112
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
PICARD:
Gul Evek.

113
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:23,041
I'm sorry that we could not
come to your aid sooner.

114
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,291
I suppose we're lucky
you came at all.

115
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,667
Lately, Starfleet seems
to look the other way

116
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,000
when the Maquis attack.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,917
I can assure you
that is not the case.

118
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:33,750
We are doing everything
in our power to control them.

119
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,417
The fact that my
ship was attacked

120
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:38,375
suggests your efforts have
met with limited success.

121
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,166
They came at us
with photon torpedoes

122
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,875
and type-8 phasers.

123
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,792
Now, tell me, Captain.

124
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,166
How do you suppose that
a group of civilians

125
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,959
acquired such weaponry?

126
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,750
I can assure you that it was
not through official channels.

127
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,709
So, you don't think the fact
that some of the Maquis

128
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,125
are former
Starfleet officers

129
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,709
has anything
to do with it?

130
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:04,041
Starfleet does not condone

131
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,667
the Maquis' actions
in the Demilitarized Zone

132
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,834
any more than<i> your</i> 
government would condone

133
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:11,959
the paramilitary actions
of Cardassian civilians.

134
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,500
We have taken measures
to deal with<i> our</i> colonists

135
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,250
who have armed themselves.

136
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,583
Considering that they destroyed
a Juhrayan freighter

137
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,458
less than a week ago,
I would say

138
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,917
that your efforts are meeting
with limited success.

139
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:25,125
Captain, if the Maquis
are not stopped

140
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,583
this situation will continue
to escalate to the point

141
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,834
where the Cardassian military
will have no choice

142
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,625
but to take matters
into their own hands.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,625
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

144
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,750
<i>Gul Evek and his crew</i>
<i>have left the</i> Enterprise

145
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,625
<i>and we have proceeded</i>
<i>to our rendezvous</i>

146
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,667
<i>with Admiral Nechayev.</i>

147
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:55,250
No Bularian canapés
this time, Captain?

148
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,625
I thought twice
was pushing it a little.

149
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,083
It's just as well.

150
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,000
They're extremely
fattening.

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,542
You missed Gul Evek
by a matter of hours.

152
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,625
I asked him to stay.

153
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,458
I thought that an admiral's
assurances might convince him

154
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,041
that we are trying to deal
with this Maquis situation.

155
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,667
Evek manages to make
the Cardassians sound

156
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:18,083
like helpless sheep
being preyed on

157
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,625
by Federation wolves.

158
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,208
The truth is, we caught
the Cardassian government

159
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,875
supplying its colonies
in the Demilitarized Zone

160
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,625
with weapons.

161
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,250
Now, Gul Evek assured me that
they had stopped that practice.

162
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,458
(<i> rueful chuckle</i> )

163
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,375
How comforting.

164
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:38,750
Admiral, this Maquis situation
has you worried.

165
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,458
Believe me, Captain

166
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,250
if I were living that close
to the Cardassians

167
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,583
I'd keep a phaser
under my pillow, too

168
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,500
but in the last weeks,
we've seen signs

169
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,250
that the Maquis
are moving beyond self-defense.

170
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,625
Their ranks are growing.

171
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,000
They're acquiring ships,
weapons.

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,041
They seem
to be preparing

173
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,959
for a more aggressive
military posture.

174
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,291
We've got to put a stop to them

175
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,458
before the entire
Demilitarized Zone ignites.

176
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,709
But before
we stop them

177
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:10,917
we have to find them.

178
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,125
They seem to be scattered
in small cells around the Zone

179
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,625
and we don't have reliable
intelligence about any of them.

180
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,500
Perhaps you need...

181
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,792
an undercover operative.

182
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:27,375
Our thinking exactly.

183
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,083
We intend to infiltrate
their organization

184
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,792
and the person
we want to do it

185
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:35,375
is aboard your
ship right now.

186
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,291
Starfleet wants<i> me</i> 
to infiltrate the Maquis?

187
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,959
Because of your recent training

188
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,000
because you're Bajoran

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and... because of your
past troubles with Starfleet.

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,166
It gives you
a certain credibility.

191
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,792
Well, that's certainly true.

192
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,875
And just how soon
would this mission begin?

193
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,083
Immediately.

194
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,750
I see.

195
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:02,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

196
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,291
I've spent the better part
of my life

197
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,834
fighting the Cardassians.

198
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:12,000
I never thought
I'd be helping them out.

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,875
Well, this is a rare case

200
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,000
when our interests
and theirs coincide.

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,458
We both want peace
in the Demilitarized Zone.

202
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,750
I've heard a lot
about the Maquis.

203
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,041
One of my instructors
at tactical training

204
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,333
a Lieutenant Commander
in Starfleet--

205
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,375
a man I both admired
and respected--

206
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,917
he was sympathetic
to them.

207
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:36,458
He resigned and
left to join them.

208
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,125
We're all sympathetic,
Lieutenant.

209
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,458
Our civilian population
in the Demilitarized Zone

210
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,000
is in a very
difficult situation

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,125
but even sympathy
has to end at some point.

212
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,625
A peace treaty isn't
just a piece of paper.

213
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:52,083
If the Maquis force us
into a war with Cardassia

214
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,834
it could mean hundreds
of thousands of lives.

215
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,542
Two years ago

216
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:59,667
Starfleet would never have
tapped<i> you</i> for this mission.

217
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,667
They must have a lot
of confidence

218
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,750
in you now.

219
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,792
The way I see it

220
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,875
there's one good reason
to take this mission

221
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,417
and that's to validate
your faith in me.

222
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,166
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

223
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,709
(<i> conversation dies down</i> )

224
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:13,375
We are looking
for a Bajoran woman.

225
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,000
Dark hair.

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,166
She is responsible

227
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,208
for the death
of a Cardassian soldier.

228
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,000
(<i> scattered laughter</i> )

229
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,208
If we learn
she has been here

230
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,792
this establishment
will be closed down.

231
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:27,667
You say she has
dark hair?

232
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes.

233
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,125
She was here.

234
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,333
You just
missed her.

235
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,375
Do you know
where she went?

236
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,583
No.

237
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,041
(<i> door closes</i> )

238
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,083
(<i> conversation resumes</i> )

239
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,125
Hey...

240
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,500
It was really nice
meeting you.

241
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,750
Oh...

242
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,250
Thanks.

243
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,917
So... did you kill
that Cardassian?

244
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,792
Starfleet thinks I did.

245
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:26,709
That's reason
enough to hide.

246
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,458
Why did you tell
them that I'd left?

247
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,667
There are worse things
a person can do

248
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:34,083
than kill
a Cardassian soldier.

249
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,917
You don't often
meet someone

250
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,750
willing to say
that out loud.

251
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,792
In the Zone, there are a lot
of us who feel that way.

252
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,417
I'd like to meet
people like that.

253
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,750
(<i> gasps</i> )

254
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,041
Don't be afraid.

255
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,542
You're not in danger here.

256
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,750
What is
your name?

257
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,709
Did you kill
that Cardassian soldier?

258
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,125
Who are you?

259
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,083
We're the people
who saved you from Starfleet.

260
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,125
Thanks,
but I'll be going now.

261
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,166
Did you kill that Cardassian?

262
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,208
Yes.

263
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,375
That's a risky thing to do
in the Demilitarized Zone.

264
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,792
You can end up
being hunted

265
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:44,083
by Starfleet<i> and</i> 
the Cardassians.

266
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,542
Then why did he risk
bringing me here?

267
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:48,959
<i>We're</i> asking the questions.

268
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,500
Who are you?

269
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,083
My name is Ro Laren.

270
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,375
I grew up in the Bajoran camps.

271
00:14:56,375 --> 00:15:00,208
Well, that would explain why you
have no love for Cardassians.

272
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,750
I know what they're capable of.

273
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,917
They tortured my father to death
and I was forced to watch.

274
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:09,333
Where are you living now?

275
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,291
RO:
Nowhere.

276
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:15,208
I was a Starfleet officer,
but I was court-martialed

277
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,417
and I was sent
to the stockade on Jaros II.

278
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,583
I'm not exactly what you'd call
Starfleet material.

279
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,417
When were you on Jaros?

280
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,375
What difference does it make?

281
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,000
We want to check your story.

282
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,417
When were you there?

283
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,959
Starfleet let me out
about three years ago

284
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,875
because I agreed to do
some work for them--

285
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,208
mostly having to do
with Bajor.

286
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,500
But I got tired
of watching them

287
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,166
placate the Cardassians,
and so I left.

288
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,083
You resigned?

289
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,000
Not officially.

290
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,500
That's part of the reason
why they're looking for me.

291
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,542
What were you doing on Ronara?

292
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:52,709
Look, I think I've answered
enough of your questions.

293
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,583
I would like to know
who you people are.

294
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:59,834
Let's say that we sympathize
with those who oppose Cardassia.

295
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,291
Are you Maquis?

296
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,375
What if we were?

297
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,709
If you were, I would ask

298
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:09,250
if I could join you
and help you fight.

299
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:12,667
We'll check your story.

300
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,709
Go ahead.
I'll keep an eye on her.

301
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,375
Come.

302
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,458
Let's stretch our legs.

303
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,959
Aren't you taking a chance
by letting me see all of this?

304
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:58,083
What if my story
doesn't check out?

305
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,375
What if I'm not
who I say I am?

306
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:04,083
Well, then we'll have
a problem, won't we?

307
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,583
You<i> are</i> Maquis,
aren't you?

308
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,875
Many of the people here are.

309
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,291
Starfleet considers
you outlaws.

310
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,250
(<i> chuckling</i> )

311
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,333
They're afraid you'll
destroy the peace treaty.

312
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,750
They don't understand
the situation here in the Zone.

313
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,375
I lived on Juhraya.

314
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,917
When the treaty was signed

315
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:32,709
the colony suddenly found itself
in Cardassian territory.

316
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:38,917
Some of us chose to stay,
take our chances.

317
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:44,583
Then one night, I was dragged
from my bed and beaten.

318
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,041
The authorities
clucked their tongues

319
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,667
and agreed it was
an unfortunate incident...

320
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,166
and did nothing.

321
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,917
I'm not surprised.

322
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:57,125
The Cardassians intend
to make life so unpleasant

323
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,000
for Federation citizens
that they'll leave.

324
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,875
Exactly.

325
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:05,166
And no one seems
to see that!

326
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,917
Except... the Maquis.

327
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,417
How old were you
when your father was killed?

328
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:25,208
I'd rather not
talk about that.

329
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:28,750
You hungry?

330
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,208
Would you like something?

331
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,166
No. Thank you.

332
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,166
<i>Hasperat.</i>

333
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,000
You like<i> hasperat?</i>

334
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,417
Uh, an old Bajoran friend
of mine used to make it

335
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,458
although his was stronger.

336
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,041
He was killed many years ago

337
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:06,875
fighting the Cardassian
occupation of Bajor.

338
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,959
I miss his company.

339
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,125
And his<i> hasperat.</i>

340
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,333
My father used to make
the strongest<i> hasperat</i>

341
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,750
you've ever tasted.

342
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,583
Everything else seems
mild by comparison.

343
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,291
Did he teach you
how to make it?

344
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:28,125
Yes, but I haven't...
I haven't tried it in years.

345
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,709
If you would make the brine
for a really strong<i> hasperat--</i>

346
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:36,959
I mean, um, eye-watering,
tongue-searing strong--

347
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:39,375
you'd make an old man
very happy.

348
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,709
I would enjoy
making it again.

349
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:43,250
MAN:
Macias.

350
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,458
I've checked with my
sources at Starfleet.

351
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,667
Her story's true.

352
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,500
I was sure it was.

353
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,542
Kalita, she'll stay with you

354
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:57,291
until we can
find her a room.

355
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,667
Ah, there you are.

356
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,333
We've just heard
a disturbing rumor.

357
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,500
Another rumor.

358
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
One that I think
we should take seriously.

359
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,000
A trader coming from Pendi II
said he could verify

360
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,709
that the Cardassians
are going to start
supplying their colonists

361
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:33,583
with biogenic weapons.

362
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,875
I thought every shipment

363
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,083
coming into the
Zone was searched.

364
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,041
The Cardassians always seem

365
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,625
to find a way around
problems like that.

366
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,333
Then we have to make
a preemptive strike.

367
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,542
Send a message
to the Cardassians

368
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:47,667
that we won't sit still

369
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:48,959
while they kill us
with toxins.

370
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,458
Agreed.

371
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,333
But we can't mount a strike
without medical supplies

372
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,750
and our stockpile
is dangerously low.

373
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,041
If we put in a request for more,
it'll draw suspicion.

374
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,583
I can get
medical supplies.

375
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,792
I served on
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

376
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,542
They always have
extra medkits on hand

377
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:05,625
for relief missions.

378
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,834
But you're wanted
by Starfleet.

379
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,417
They're not going
to give you medkits

380
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,041
just because
you ask for them.

381
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,375
I have no intention
of asking for them.

382
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,917
I intend to take them.

383
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:15,417
How?

384
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,458
The<i> Enterprise</i> is a fortress.

385
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:21,083
I know its security systems.

386
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,959
Give me a ship.

387
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,458
I can do this.

388
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,291
This is madness.

389
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,083
We can't let her
do something like this.

390
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,875
We don't know
anything about her.

391
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:34,250
I know, but she can make
very strong<i> hasperat.</i>

392
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,959
What?

393
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:38,250
We need

394
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,542
medical supplies.

395
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,291
I think...

396
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,667
we should let her try.

397
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:51,166
All right,
but I'm going with her.

398
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,542
I could use an extra hand
at the controls.

399
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:56,458
And a witness.

400
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,875
I've set the transporter
confinement parameters

401
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,875
to maximum.

402
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,208
We should be able
to fill our hold

403
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,333
with medical supplies

404
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,125
with just one
single beam-out.

405
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,333
I had no idea
it was going to be so easy.

406
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,458
We're approaching
the Federation border.

407
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,917
How do you plan to get out
of the Demilitarized Zone

408
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:25,000
without being searched
at one of the checkpoints?

409
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,291
We're going to cross
the border here.

410
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,959
There are sensor buoys
all along the border.

411
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:33,166
If we cross anywhere
other than a checkpoint

412
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,583
Starfleet will send a ship
to investigate.

413
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,375
With the right security codes

414
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:40,000
we can disable the proximity
detectors on the buoys.

415
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,333
Starfleet changes those codes
all the time.

416
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,083
I know
the encryption algorithms.

417
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,709
If I can access the buoys'
protocol subsystem

418
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:50,208
I should be able
to figure out the codes.

419
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,834
<i>Should</i> be able to?

420
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,625
Do you want this mission
to succeed?

421
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,792
Of course I do.

422
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,542
We need those medical supplies.

423
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:00,583
In that case

424
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,166
let me do my job.

425
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,375
(<i> beeping</i> )

426
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:05,750
I'm in.

427
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:10,667
(<i> strident beeping</i> )

428
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:11,709
What's wrong?

429
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:12,917
If I don't input

430
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:14,583
the right code
in the next 20 seconds

431
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,291
we'll trigger
the proximity alarm.

432
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,500
I'm getting us
out of sensor range.

433
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,000
Don't. If we break
the com-link

434
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,458
we won't be able
to try again.

435
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,083
(<i> beeping</i> )

436
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,000
(<i> sighing</i> )

437
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,458
It worked.

438
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,709
Until they change
the access codes again

439
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:32,625
we can cross
the border here.

440
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:36,625
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47943.2.</i>

441
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,166
<i>It has been over a week</i>

442
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,166
<i>since Lieutenant Ro</i>
<i>left the</i> Enterprise.

443
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:44,000
<i>We have yet to receive</i>
<i>any communication from her.</i>

444
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,458
We picked up a request
for emergency assistance

445
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,709
from a Federation science ship
in the Topin system.

446
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:51,792
Are there any other
ships in the vicinity?

447
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:53,083
We're the closest.

448
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,750
Helm, set a course
for the Topin system.

449
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,208
Mr. Data, will you signal
the science ship

450
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,417
that we're
on our way?

451
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:00,709
It is unlikely
they would receive

452
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:02,166
our communication, sir.

453
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,458
The Topin system contains
an unstable protostar.

454
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,709
It generates significant
magnetascopic interference.

455
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:09,583
Can we use our
sensors to find them?

456
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,959
Most of our sensors
would be ineffective

457
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,375
although our directional array

458
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,208
should cut through
the interference.

459
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,291
That array has
such a narrow scan field.

460
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,458
We might as well break out
the palm beacons

461
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,291
and try to find them
that way.

462
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,375
This is insane.

463
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,959
We're sitting here--

464
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:32,083
no sensors,
blind to the outside--

465
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,583
waiting for
a Galaxy-class starship

466
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,500
to come swooping down on us.

467
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,709
Don't worry.

468
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,709
It'll be hard
for them to locate us

469
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,709
with just their
directional sensors.

470
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:43,834
Besides, they're looking
for a damaged science ship

471
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:45,208
that wants to be found.

472
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,083
(<i> beeping</i> )

473
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,917
They're here.

474
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:52,291
Stand by to
engage thrusters.

475
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,750
RIKER:
Anything?

476
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,417
No, sir, it will take
approximately six hours

477
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:56,834
to scan the system.

478
00:24:56,834 --> 00:25:01,000
Captain, the distress call
is being repeated.

479
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,333
Data, can you
locate the signal?

480
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,417
I am attempting to do so.

481
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,792
They're scanning
our last position.

482
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:10,083
All right, I've locked
onto their sensor beam.

483
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,959
I'm going to use it
to maneuver into
transporter range.

484
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:14,834
How are we going to beam
through their shields?

485
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:16,250
We can't.

486
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,750
If we're going to get
those medical supplies

487
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,333
we're going to have
to take this ship

488
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,625
through their shields.

489
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:26,458
Sir, I am scanning the area

490
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,500
from which the distress signal
was sent, but I'm unable

491
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,709
to detect a vessel.

492
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:33,208
Captain, the computer
has detected

493
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:35,875
a piggyback communication
on the last distress signal.

494
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,458
Can you decode it?

495
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:38,875
It will take a few moments.

496
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,291
Do it.

497
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:42,542
The<i> Enterprise</i> shields
have a weak point.

498
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,291
When the ship is at impulse,
the thrust destabilizes

499
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:47,583
the shield configuration
right at this point.

500
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,125
I'm going to try to
punch through there.

501
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,125
Won't they detect us?

502
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,333
They'll know something's
penetrated the shields

503
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,709
but, with all
the interference

504
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:56,542
it'll take them a
few seconds to find us.

505
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,250
We'll have to beam
the medical supplies aboard

506
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,125
and get out fast.

507
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,917
The message is difficult
to decode.

508
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:06,709
Interference has garbled
much of the transmission

509
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:10,000
but it seems to be coming
from Lieutenant Ro.

510
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,208
Ro is on that ship.

511
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,917
DATA:
Sir

512
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:16,250
a vessel of some kind

513
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,333
is attempting to penetrate
our aft shields.

514
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:21,834
Let it through.

515
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,875
We're going to make it.

516
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,333
All right, we're in.

517
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,750
Energizing.

518
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:49,250
Let's get out of here.

519
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,625
Captain, a quantity
of medical supplies

520
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,333
was beamed from Cargo Bay Seven.

521
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,959
The vessel that penetrated our
shields is of the same design

522
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:59,625
as the ships used by the Maquis.

523
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,208
It is moving off.

524
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,875
Let it go.

525
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,834
There must be
someone with her.

526
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,083
We should make it
look as though

527
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,917
we're trying to stop them.

528
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:11,959
Mr. Worf, lock phasers
on their previous position

529
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,125
and fire.

530
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:15,625
Aye, sir.

531
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:19,500
Now we know what they mean
by<i> advanced</i> tactical training.

532
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,542
You took your ship
<i>through</i> their shields?

533
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:29,208
Ro parked us<i> between</i> 
their warp nacelles.

534
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:31,333
I thought she was crazy,
but it worked.

535
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,250
She knew exactly
what she was doing.

536
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,375
Well done.

537
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:35,750
We'll have to
inventory supplies

538
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,208
and find out what we have.

539
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,750
See you later.

540
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,250
Well, it seems
Kalita has decided

541
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,709
that you're not
a Federation spy after all.

542
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,542
(<i> chuckles</i> )

543
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:53,000
She's suspicious
of everyone at first

544
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,667
and rightly so.

545
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,917
We've learned to be cautious
of strangers.

546
00:27:57,917 --> 00:27:59,542
No, I understand.

547
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:02,542
But I've known
since I first met you

548
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:05,792
that, in your heart,
you're one of us.

549
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:13,250
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

550
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,166
<i>Having earned</i>
<i>the Maquis' trust</i>

551
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,709
<i>with her raid on the</i> Enterprise

552
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:19,000
<i>Lieutenant Ro has been given</i>
<i>access to a ship</i>

553
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,333
<i>and allowed to leave</i>
<i>the settlement by herself.</i>

554
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,542
There are rumors
that the Cardassians

555
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:27,625
are supplying their colonists
with biogenic weapons.

556
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,166
Frankly, I find that hard
to believe.

557
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,375
Every ship that enters
the Demilitarized Zone

558
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,834
is being searched.

559
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,709
Well, the Maquis are convinced
that the Cardassians

560
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:36,333
are finding a way around
these searches.

561
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,709
You know, we could
make use of that.

562
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:39,792
Sir?

563
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:45,333
We have come up with a plan
that has the potential

564
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,417
to seriously curtail
the Maquis.

565
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:50,917
We want to give them a target
so threatening to them

566
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:54,125
that they'll be willing
to commit as many ships

567
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:57,000
and people as possible
in order to destroy it.

568
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,917
What do you mean,
"give them a target"?

569
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:02,959
Well, biogenic weapons,
for example.

570
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:06,583
You could provide them
with intelligence

571
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:08,542
which would show
that the Cardassians

572
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:11,458
<i>are</i> in fact supplying
their colonists with them.

573
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,834
That would get
their attention, all right.

574
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:15,083
You could tell them

575
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,000
that in order to get
past the checkpoints

576
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,500
they're shipping
the components
for these weapons

577
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,917
through third parties

578
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:25,166
and then, we could
put together a convoy

579
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:28,709
and send it towards
the Demilitarized Zone.

580
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:31,750
And when the Maquis
attack it

581
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,291
Starfleet would be
waiting for them.

582
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,667
We could station our ships
in the Hugora Nebula

583
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:36,875
to avoid detection.

584
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:41,208
Basically, I would
be leading them into a trap.

585
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:42,458
That's right.

586
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:47,542
If you have a problem
with any of this

587
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:49,083
I need to know it now.

588
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,875
Well, if I do, sir

589
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,250
it will not stop me
from carrying out my duty.

590
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:00,291
I knew that I
could count on you.

591
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,208
It took me a while,
but I managed

592
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,542
to patch through
into Starfleet's comsystem.

593
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,917
I intercepted
communication

594
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:13,583
from one of the checkpoints
along the border.

595
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,041
They're concerned

596
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,375
because a Pakled transport

597
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,917
came through carrying
retroviral vaccines.

598
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,000
Why is that
a concern?

599
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,750
Well, last week,
a Ferengi transport came through

600
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,125
carrying biomimetic gels.

601
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,250
By themselves,
neither of these is dangerous

602
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,208
<i>but</i> Starfleet
is concerned

603
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,375
because, along
with other components

604
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:36,750
the Cardassians could
put together a biogenic device.

605
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,917
Well, what is Starfleet
going to do about it?

606
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,709
They can't<i> do</i> anything about it.

607
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:42,792
These items
are all perfectly legal.

608
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,166
How close are the Cardassians

609
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,166
to having
the components they need?

610
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,625
Very close.

611
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:51,125
Two days ago, a Yridian convoy
left Deep Space 9

612
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,125
for the Demilitarized Zone.

613
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,542
It's carrying isomiotic hypos

614
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:58,583
plasma flares
and quarantine pods.

615
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:00,959
We can't let that convoy
reach its destination.

616
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:04,000
But it's too big for us
to go after alone.

617
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,542
I'll discuss the situation
with the other cell leaders.

618
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:09,917
Considering what's at stake

619
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:12,041
they'll want
to help.

620
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:36,208
I've sent a communication
to the others.

621
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:42,709
When this is over,
we'll celebrate.

622
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:44,625
When it's over?

623
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,208
When Cardassia realizes
they can't intimidate us

624
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:49,709
into leaving
our colonies.

625
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:51,709
Something tells me
it'll be a long time

626
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,458
before we're celebrating.

627
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:57,500
Don't be discouraged, Ro.

628
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,166
It'll take time

629
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:03,959
but the important thing
is that we not give up.

630
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,917
I spent ten years in the camps.

631
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:07,542
I don't give up.

632
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:11,792
I've been thinking
a long time

633
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:14,750
about what our
celebration will be like.

634
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,834
We'll have a huge dinner.

635
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:21,041
You'll make<i> hasperat</i> and
I'll make blueberry pie.

636
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:25,166
We'll drink wine
and we'll dance.

637
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:27,458
I'll even play
the<i> belaklavion.</i>

638
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,583
That'll give everyone
a laugh.

639
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,583
You play
the<i> klavion?</i>

640
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,417
Yes. Badly.

641
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:37,625
It's a difficult instrument

642
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,959
but I enjoy the challenge.

643
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,083
My father played
the<i> klavion.</i>

644
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:45,834
When I was very young

645
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:48,709
and afraid of monsters
under my bed...

646
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:53,083
he'd play for me.

647
00:32:56,208 --> 00:33:00,458
He said that the<i> klavion</i> 
had special powers.

648
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,959
Monsters were afraid of it

649
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:07,417
and when
they heard it

650
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:08,792
they would disappear.

651
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,834
When I listened to that music
he played for me...

652
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:20,500
I was never afraid
to go to sleep.

653
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,500
When he died...

654
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:36,083
I realized even he couldn't
make all the monsters go away.

655
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:43,667
Why wait?

656
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,458
Let's go to the market.

657
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:47,500
Let's get food
for a feast.

658
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,875
For a celebration.

659
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,041
A celebration of what?

660
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:56,417
Of absolutely nothing.

661
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,959
Just to celebrate.

662
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:01,542
I'd like that.

663
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:04,834
Come, let's go
to the market.

664
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,291
If I'm to make a pie

665
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:09,333
we'll have to find a
substitute for blueberries.

666
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,125
I haven't seen
real ones in years.

667
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:14,083
On Bajor, there's
a berry called<i> teakle.</i>

668
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:16,667
Yes, I know--
very sweet.

669
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,125
(<i> people yelling and screaming</i> )

670
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:43,000
Ro!

671
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,125
(<i> grunts</i> )

672
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,583
(<i> yells</i> )

673
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,583
Macias!

674
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,417
(<i> groans</i> )

675
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,500
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

676
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,458
They must have discovered that
there was a Maquis cell here.

677
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,917
Kalita, get one of the medkits.
Hurry!

678
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,166
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

679
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,000
You have to hang on.

680
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:50,542
When an old fighter
like me dies...

681
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:58,166
someone always steps forward
to take his place.

682
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,083
Mmm...

683
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,333
Not tonight.

684
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,625
Hello.

685
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:38,625
Are you alone?

686
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,834
I hope not.

687
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:42,250
Why don't we
get acquainted?

688
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,208
There's a table in the back
that's more private.

689
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:46,875
I'd like that.

690
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:02,041
We have to cancel
the mission.

691
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,917
Why?

692
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:06,750
Well, the Maquis didn't
go for the bait.

693
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,166
They think the convoy
is... too big a target.

694
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:12,125
There are only
six ships.

695
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:14,333
We could even
cut back that number.

696
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,625
It's the commitment
of resources

697
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:19,792
of grouping so many

698
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:21,959
of the Maquis
together at once.

699
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:24,083
They feel that it makes
them too vulnerable.

700
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,458
Every intelligence report
that I get from Starfleet

701
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,959
suggests that the Maquis

702
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:33,917
are eager
to expand their strikes.

703
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:35,542
They want to escalate
their activities.

704
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:37,041
Now you're telling me

705
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:39,542
this isn't true?

706
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:42,792
It's probably
different in every cell.

707
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:45,166
The people I've
met tend to be...

708
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,875
more conservative.

709
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:50,208
I'm sure others have
a more militant attitude.

710
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,500
Laren, what's going on?

711
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:59,000
Do you have the money
I asked you to bring?

712
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,291
Yes.

713
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:02,125
Put some
on the table.

714
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,208
What?

715
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:06,875
By this time, you should
be negotiating my price.

716
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:21,709
When you sent me
on this mission...

717
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:24,250
I thought that
I could do it.

718
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,542
Even though it meant
helping the Cardassians.

719
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:28,458
Even though it meant
betraying people

720
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:30,166
who were fighting
against them.

721
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:35,083
Now I'm not sure
where I stand.

722
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:38,667
Are you saying that you want
to back out of this mission?

723
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:42,792
Sir, I don't want
to let you down.

724
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:43,875
I swear that I don't.

725
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:45,583
This has nothing
to do with me.

726
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,166
This is about you.

727
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,875
If you back out now

728
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:51,834
you'll throw away
everything you've worked for.

729
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,792
We're committed
to this mission.

730
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:04,291
My only question
for you is:

731
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,667
Can you carry out
your orders?

732
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:13,000
I could put you before
a Board of Inquiry

733
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,250
for having lied to me
about this operation.

734
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,500
I would certainly
have you court-martialed

735
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,709
if you sabotage it.

736
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,959
Now, it's your decision.

737
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:31,000
I'll carry out
my orders, sir.

738
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,125
I feel it necessary
to have...

739
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,834
have Commander Riker
go back with you.

740
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:42,500
He can... pose as...
a relative.

741
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,667
I just want
to make sure that...

742
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:47,375
nothing happens
to obstruct this mission.

743
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:55,333
Sorry. I don't have
that kind of money.

744
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,625
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

745
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:04,041
<i>We have received word</i>

746
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:06,125
<i>from Commander Riker</i>
<i>and Lieutenant Ro</i>

747
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,542
<i>that the Maquis</i>
<i>will be attacking the convoy</i>

748
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:09,792
<i>as planned.</i>

749
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:11,333
<i>Our ships</i>
<i>have taken up position</i>

750
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,625
<i>in the Hugora Nebula</i>
<i>to wait for them.</i>

751
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,041
I have established
a relay link

752
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,417
with the sensor probe

753
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:19,041
we left on the perimeter
of the nebula.

754
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,375
This is the convoy.

755
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,208
We are expecting
the Maquis attack force

756
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:24,750
to cross the border
from the Demilitarized Zone.

757
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,458
As soon as they cross the
border, we'll intercept them.

758
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,208
Captain, in order to ensure

759
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,667
that the ship Commander Riker
and Lieutenant Ro are piloting

760
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:31,917
does not come under fire

761
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:33,375
I have relayed
their warp signature

762
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,166
to the rest
of the attack force.

763
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,250
Sir, the Maquis squadron

764
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,375
is coming into
sensor range.

765
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:41,208
Go to red alert.

766
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,166
Aye, sir.

767
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,333
MAN:
Squad leader to all ships.

768
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:51,041
Go ahead,
squad leader.

769
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:54,291
We'll be crossing the border
in less than one minute.

770
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:55,542
Arm your weapons.

771
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:57,041
RO:
Acknowledged.

772
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:58,667
Starfleet can't make its move

773
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:01,291
until we're out
of the Demilitarized Zone.

774
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,375
We're to break formation
and take cover in the nebula

775
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:04,875
as soon as they appear.

776
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,875
The ships in the convoy
are raising their shields.

777
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,667
They've spotted us.

778
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:12,375
We cross the border
in 30 seconds.

779
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:16,667
What the...?

780
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:22,083
I'm sorry.

781
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:24,375
I can't let this happen.

782
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,959
Sir, the vessel being piloted
by Lieutenant Ro

783
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:32,166
is firing a low-intensity
particle beam into the nebula.

784
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,834
What the hell
is she doing?

785
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:36,375
The polarizing effect
being created by the beam

786
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,542
may make it possible
for us to be detected.

787
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:40,291
Can you counter
the effect?

788
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,291
I will attempt to do so.

789
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,125
Ro, why are you firing?

790
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:45,625
Scan the nebula.

791
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,500
There's a Starfleet attack
force hiding inside it.

792
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,166
I see it.

793
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,834
Squad leader to all ships.

794
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:54,125
Abort the mission.

795
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,125
Repeat-- abort the mission.

796
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:59,125
Sir, the Maquis ships
are breaking formation.

797
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,917
PICARD:
Have they crossed
the border?

798
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:03,208
DATA:
No, sir.
They are withdrawing.

799
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,208
WORF:
Captain.

800
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:06,458
(<i> console beeping</i> )

801
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:07,917
Lieutenant Ro's ship

802
00:42:07,917 --> 00:42:10,291
is not retreating
with the others.

803
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:13,333
It is heading towards us.

804
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:16,333
When she comes aboard...

805
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,333
take her into custody.

806
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:22,125
Alpha Seven to Alpha Nine.

807
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,208
KALITA:
Go ahead.

808
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,583
Stand by to beam me aboard.

809
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:28,041
Standing by.

810
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,709
You can take this ship
back to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

811
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:32,041
You're going with<i> them?</i>

812
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,000
It's been a long time

813
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,542
since I really felt
like I belonged somewhere.

814
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:49,083
Could you tell Captain Picard
something for me?

815
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:51,500
Of course.
What is it?

816
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,500
Tell him I'm sorry.

817
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:58,417
So long, Ro.

818
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:00,625
Take care of yourself.

819
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:03,500
Good-bye, Will.

820
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,917
Energize.

821
00:43:20,709 --> 00:43:22,000
She seemed very sure

822
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,250
that she was doing
the right thing.

823
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:30,083
I think her only regret
was that she let<i> you</i> down.

824
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:36,709
Here's my report.
