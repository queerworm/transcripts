1
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:13,333
DATA:
Commander,
away team reporting in.

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,709
Lieutenant Worf standing by.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,291
This is Riker.
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

4
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,834
WORF:
The archaeologists
have identified

5
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,750
the markings in these caverns.

6
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:23,125
This planet was apparently

7
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:26,750
once home to a race
known as the Koinonians.

8
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,625
What do we know about them,
Data?

9
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,875
The Koinonians were
an intelligent culture

10
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:32,208
which became embroiled in a war

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,458
that lasted
for several
generations.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,583
Our best evidence

13
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,333
indicates they
destroyed themselves.

14
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,542
WORF:
We have completed our survey
of the third tunnel

15
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,917
and will proceed
into the ceremonial chamber.

16
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,625
Affirmative.
<i>Enterprise</i> out.

17
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:47,000
Destroyed
themselves, Data?

18
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,000
According
to historical records

19
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,250
this will be
the first opportunity

20
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,625
for a Federation team...

21
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:54,542
Captain, beam them up quickly!

22
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,375
WORF:
Captain, emergency beam-up!

23
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:58,834
<i>Enterprise,</i> emergency.
Severe injuries!

24
00:00:58,875 --> 00:00:59,959
Transporter Room?

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,208
O'BRIEN:
I've got them, Captain.

26
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,375
Beam them straight to Sick Bay.

27
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:04,000
Dr. Crusher, incoming wounded.

28
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,625
Away team is on board, Captain.

29
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,250
CRUSHER:
One dead on arrival.

30
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:57,583
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

31
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:01,875
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

32
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,458
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,208
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

34
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,792
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

35
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:15,250
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

36
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:18,667
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43198.7.</i>

37
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,583
<i>The</i> Enterprise
<i>remains in standard orbit</i>

38
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,709
<i>while we investigate</i>
<i>the tragedy</i>

39
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,792
<i>which has struck the away team.</i>

40
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,208
<i>Lieutenant Marla Aster,</i>
<i>ship's archaeologist</i>

41
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,875
<i>has been killed in what should</i>
<i>have been a routine mission.</i>

42
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:32,709
<i>Whatever the explanation</i>

43
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,709
<i>it will not bring back</i>
<i>a valued and trusted officer.</i>

44
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:43,333
Lieutenant?

45
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,750
We had completed
our investigation

46
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,583
of the third tunnel.

47
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:51,083
Our scans indicated no weapons
or traps of any kind.

48
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:55,500
Lieutenant Aster was
three meters behind me.

49
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:57,166
An explosive device went off.

50
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,166
There was no warning.

51
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,083
Lieutenant Aster
bore the full brunt

52
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,625
of the detonation.

53
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:21,000
Lieutenant Aster is survived
by a son, Jeremy, 12 years old.

54
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,250
He's aboard the
<i>Enterprise,</i> sir.

55
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,792
And his father?

56
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,000
He's also deceased.

57
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,208
His only living relatives

58
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,542
are an aunt and uncle
residing on Earth.

59
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:40,959
Where is he now?

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,250
In class.

61
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,250
I've alerted the teacher
to expect us.

62
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,000
WORF:
Captain!

63
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,625
I must accompany you.

64
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,709
I commanded the away team.

65
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,709
I appreciate your
offer, Lieutenant.

66
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,458
This is my
responsibility.

67
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,375
Picard to Bridge.
RIKER:
Yes, Captain.

68
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:09,667
Assign Commander La Forge
to lead

69
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,083
another away team
to the dig site.

70
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,667
I want to know
why this happened.

71
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:13,792
Yes, Captain.

72
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:15,208
I will be with Counselor Troi

73
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,041
and young Jeremy Aster.

74
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,458
I understand.

75
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,333
Riker out.

76
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,750
He had to do
the same thing for me.

77
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:38,583
Do you know Jeremy well?

78
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,500
But I know what this
is going to be like for him.

79
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,291
It's part of life
in Starfleet, Wesley.

80
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,750
I know.

81
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:48,333
They're very careful
to prepare us for anything.

82
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,500
But still...

83
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:50,834
I know.

84
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,875
How do you get used to it?

85
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:59,000
To telling them?

86
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,000
You hope you never do.

87
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:38,625
I sense the weight
of this duty on you, Captain.

88
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,166
I really wonder...

89
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,166
Halt.

90
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:01,750
I've always believed that
carrying children on a starship

91
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:07,417
is a very questionable policy.

92
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,875
Serving on a starship means

93
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:13,583
accepting certain risks,
certain dangers.

94
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:20,792
Did Jeremy Aster
make that choice?

95
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:23,208
Death and loss are
an integral part

96
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,291
of life everywhere.

97
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,959
Leaving him on Earth would
not have protected him.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,250
No, but the Earth
isn't likely

99
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,667
to be ordered
to the Neutral Zone

100
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,625
or to repel a Romulan attack.

101
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,083
It was my command
which sent

102
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,583
his mother to her death.

103
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,917
She understood her mission
and my duty.

104
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,083
Will he?

105
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,917
In time, and with help.

106
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,959
Wesley Crusher does.

107
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:57,375
He does, and so will Jeremy.

108
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,500
Resume.

109
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,959
Jeremy, I have some bad news.

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,625
There's been an accident.

111
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,417
Your mother... has died.

112
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:37,709
How, sir?

113
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,667
An explosive device
at the mission site.

114
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,333
She died instantly.

115
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,000
I understand.

116
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:51,166
Jeremy, I know your mother
loved you very much.

117
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm told that
your father is also dead.

118
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,083
Yes, sir.

119
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,458
He died five years ago
from a Rushton infection.

120
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,542
I'm all alone now, sir.

121
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,917
Jeremy,
on the Starship<i> Enterprise</i>

122
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,875
no one is alone.

123
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,375
No one.

124
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,083
Excuse me, sir.

125
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,542
Am I intruding?

126
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,417
No. Sit down.

127
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:56,875
How well did you know
Lieutenant Aster?

128
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:58,709
We spent some time together.

129
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:05,250
Not very well.

130
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,834
How well did you know her?

131
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,959
Why do you ask?

132
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,417
Well, you just asked me.

133
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:13,125
But... why do you
ask the question?

134
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,000
Since her death, I have been
asked several times

135
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,333
to define how well
I knew Lieutenant Aster.

136
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,375
And I heard you ask Wesley
on the Bridge

137
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:24,291
how well he knew Jeremy.

138
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:28,917
Does the question of familiarity
have some bearing on death?

139
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:37,500
Do you remember how we all felt
when Tasha died?

140
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:41,333
I do not sense
the same feelings of absence

141
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,750
that I associate
with Lieutenant Yar

142
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:46,667
although I cannot say
precisely why.

143
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,583
Just human nature, Data.

144
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,125
Human nature, sir?

145
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,417
We feel a loss more intensely
when it's a friend.

146
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,041
Hmm.

147
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,583
But should not the feelings
run just as deep

148
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,875
regardless of who has died?

149
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,875
Maybe they should, Data.

150
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:06,625
Maybe if we felt any loss

151
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:11,250
as keenly as we felt the death
of one close to us

152
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,333
human history
would be a lot less bloody.

153
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,083
La Forge to Riker.

154
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,458
You're back, Geordi?

155
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,291
Yes, sir, and we brought back
a souvenir.

156
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,834
LA FORGE:
There are five more just like it

157
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,417
all identical to the one
that killed Lieutenant Aster.

158
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,500
They employ a subspace
proximity detonator.

159
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:32,458
A normal tricorder
would never detect it.

160
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
How long would you say
they've been there, Data?

161
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:38,667
It comes from the time
of the Koinonian wars, sir.

162
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:40,250
RIKER:
Did you find them all, Geordi?

163
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,250
Yeah, but, uh...

164
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,792
Well, it seemed like they were
left there to be found.

165
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,250
Left by whom?

166
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,375
There are no indications
of life on this planet.

167
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:51,959
I don't know, Captain

168
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,250
but it was pretty obvious
that they'd been recently

169
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,667
pulled out of the ground
and defused.

170
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:03,125
I have made my report
to the Captain.

171
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,458
I'm more interested

172
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,959
in how you feel
about what happened.

173
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,083
I sense great anger.

174
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,917
I cannot seek revenge

175
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,875
against an enemy who was turned
to dust centuries ago.

176
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:22,291
Her death was senseless.

177
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,625
The last victim
of a forgotten war.

178
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:32,166
Go on.

179
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,083
There is nothing more
to be said.

180
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,417
A person died
under your command.

181
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,917
It may happen again.

182
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,083
If you can't learn
to release the anger
and the guilt

183
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,542
to talk about it...

184
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:51,834
A leader must stand alone,
as Captain Picard does.

185
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,125
Captain Picard talks to me.

186
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,166
Then, may I seek your counsel

187
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:10,000
on my plan
to make<i> R'uustai</i> with the boy.

188
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,834
The bonding?

189
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,417
It is my right.

190
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,417
It's very generous, Worf,
but he's not a Klingon child.

191
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,834
He has different
sensibilities.

192
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,000
He is an orphan.

193
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,333
I am an orphan.

194
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,500
He will understand.

195
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:31,834
Right now, there isn't
much he can understand.

196
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,166
He's holding all
his feelings inside.

197
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,834
Children often feel

198
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:42,375
that they must be true to
the memory of a lost parent.

199
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,417
If you offer them
affection too soon

200
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,667
they can feel guilty
returning that affection--

201
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:51,875
as if they're betraying
the love of the parent.

202
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:54,291
I only wish to honor his mother.

203
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,917
I know.

204
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:00,667
And I understand this
means a great deal to you.

205
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:04,000
But you must be prepared.

206
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,166
He's very angry, too.

207
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,792
But his anger is
deep inside him.

208
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,834
When he touches it,
it will strike out

209
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,875
in many directions,
including yours.

210
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,083
Be with him.

211
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:21,625
Talk to him, but
don't rush this.

212
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,208
When he's ready,
we'll know.

213
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,208
JEREMY:
Captain Patches, we have
an alien ship in front of us.

214
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,667
What shall we do, Captain?

215
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:39,959
Oh, no, we've been hit,
Captain.

216
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,709
We're going down!

217
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,250
MAN (<i> chuckling</i> ):
That was great.

218
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,500
Now, uh, let's
get a shot of Mom.

219
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,625
What are you doing?

220
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,792
I'll turn your lens
into pottery shards.

221
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:51,375
Go away. Go away.

222
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:52,667
Go away!

223
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:56,625
Over there, over there.

224
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:57,750
(<i> cat meows</i> )

225
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,542
Patches.

226
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,041
Captain Patches...
(<i> door chimes</i> )

227
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,834
...is coming in for a landing
on the sofa.

228
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,750
Oh, no! He's going to crash...

229
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,375
(<i> turns off device</i> )

230
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,166
Jeremy Aster?

231
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,417
I am Lieutenant Worf.

232
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,208
May I enter?

233
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,500
You were in command
of the away team.

234
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:28,834
Yes.

235
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,375
I was with Lieutenant Aster,
your mother

236
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:36,583
when she died.

237
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,667
You're a Klingon, aren't you?

238
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:41,166
Yes.

239
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,417
We studied about Klingons
in school.

240
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:51,250
What did they teach you
about us?

241
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,250
You used to be
our enemies.

242
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,083
Did they also teach you
that every Klingon hopes

243
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,709
to die in the line of duty
as your mother did?

244
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:09,917
In my tradition, we do not
grieve the loss of the body.

245
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,166
We celebrate the releasing
of the spirit.

246
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,333
I understand death.

247
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,166
They teach us all about it.

248
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:23,375
Jeremy Aster, we may
both understand it

249
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:26,250
but we must bring meaning
to your mother's death.

250
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,250
Perhaps we can do it together.

251
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,458
(<i> door chimes</i> )

252
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,834
Come.

253
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,333
Counselor.

254
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,458
How is the boy?

255
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,000
He's being very brave.

256
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,500
Good.

257
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:54,792
No, he has to get past brave.

258
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,208
He's very angry

259
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,542
and he has to learn
how to express that anger

260
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,709
before he can really say
good-bye to his mother.

261
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,500
How can we help?

262
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:08,625
Well, I've asked Beverly
if we might get Wesley

263
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,667
to talk to Jeremy about
his father's death.

264
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:13,291
Oh.

265
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,208
The one unusual
element is Worf.

266
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,667
Oh?

267
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:20,834
In many ways, he's suffering
as badly as the boy.

268
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,250
He wishes to involve Jeremy

269
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,041
in a Klingon ceremony
called<i> R'uustai--</i>

270
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,625
the bonding.

271
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,500
I know of that.

272
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,834
Well, perhaps it will be
helpful to both of them.

273
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,792
I don't think Jeremy's ready
to accept Worf right now.

274
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:37,458
Perhaps later, but...

275
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,041
it will have to be
handled most delicately.

276
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,417
As you always do.

277
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,917
I break the unpleasant news

278
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,625
and there
my responsibility ends

279
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,125
but you...

280
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,709
you have to stay with them

281
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,041
through the entire
grieving process.

282
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:58,625
We deal with our pain
in many different ways

283
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:01,709
but, over the years, I've
discovered it's in joy

284
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,750
that the uniqueness of each
individual is revealed.

285
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:09,959
If I can help a person
back to a state of joy...

286
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,959
Well, my role
has its rewards.

287
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,542
RIKER:
Captain, we're picking up

288
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,375
an energy field
on the planet's surface.

289
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:25,959
Location?

290
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,458
Two kilometers north of
the away team's beam-down point.

291
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,250
Indeed?

292
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,667
Full scan.

293
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:36,291
DATA:
Inconclusive, Captain.

294
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:40,333
Sir, I'm sensing a
presence on the planet.

295
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,375
Very vague.

296
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,125
Life-form?
I can't be sure.

297
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,875
The emotions of the
crew are particularly
strong right now.

298
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,417
It's difficult
to filter them out.

299
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,625
Data, scan analysis
on main viewer.

300
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,625
Hi.

301
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:06,917
Hi.

302
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,083
Troi stopped by
a little while ago.

303
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,375
She was wondering
if you might be willing

304
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,625
to talk to Jeremy Aster
at some point.

305
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,542
Me?

306
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,959
What for?

307
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,625
About your dad.

308
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,041
What am<i> I</i> going to tell him?

309
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,583
It would help him
to talk to somebody

310
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,250
who's been through this.

311
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,208
We had each other, Wes.

312
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,834
He doesn't have anyone
to lean on right now

313
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,375
and he might be more comfortable

314
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:42,709
talking to someone who's not
that much older than he is.

315
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,875
Okay, I'll think about it.

316
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,291
Okay.

317
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,583
Do you ever think
about him, Mom?

318
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,166
Your father?

319
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,083
Sure, I do.

320
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:22,041
Sometimes, I can't even remember
what his face looks like.

321
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,834
It scares me.

322
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,250
It happens to all of us, Wes.

323
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,750
Sometimes...

324
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:38,875
I can't get his face
out of my mind.

325
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:42,417
Today... today, it's like...

326
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:47,542
I can see it all as clearly
as if it were yesterday.

327
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,959
I can remember
the way Dad looked

328
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,458
when he hugged me good-bye.

329
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,458
Captain Picard's eyes
when he came to tell us...

330
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:07,166
Data, run comparison
of known phenomena.

331
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,458
The pattern has no exact match
in Federation records, sir.

332
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,625
Is it alive?

333
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,500
A possibility.

334
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:17,000
LA FORGE:
Captain, I'm getting
an unusual magnetic flux reading

335
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:20,625
from the anti-matter
containment pods.

336
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,417
My god.

337
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,834
JEREMY:
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

338
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,792
Okay, you got
ten seconds more, Mom.

339
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:28,000
No peeking.

340
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,583
Come on, Patches, in here.

341
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,041
Shh.

342
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,667
Okay, Mom, we're ready.

343
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:37,291
ASTER:
Jeremy, I'm getting closer.

344
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,041
Jeremy?

345
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,542
I'm going to find you.

346
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,333
You must be in here somewhere.

347
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,041
Jeremy?

348
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,250
Mom?!

349
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,917
All systems
are functioning normally.

350
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:05,500
Still, there's this fluctuation
in the containment field.

351
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:06,875
I can't account for it.

352
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:08,083
Data, is this possibly related

353
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,000
to the energy fields
on the planet?

354
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,834
There is a beam of highly
charged particles

355
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,667
emanating from the planet, sir

356
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:16,125
but I cannot pinpoint
the location yet.

357
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:21,458
Captain, there's a presence
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

358
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,834
An alien presence?

359
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,750
DATA:
No intruder noted
by the sensors, sir.

360
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,709
There is a presence.

361
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,250
Security, all decks,
yellow alert.

362
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,834
Possible intruder.

363
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,542
They said you were dead.

364
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,000
There was a mistake.

365
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,458
It's okay.

366
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,166
But there was an explosion.

367
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,792
You were hurt.

368
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:05,500
I'm fine.

369
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:08,375
You mustn't think
anymore about this.

370
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:09,834
The important thing is

371
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,917
I'm never going
to leave you again.

372
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,041
I think somebody needs a hug.

373
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:43,041
We have to go now.

374
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,750
Where?

375
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:46,291
To the planet.

376
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,542
That's where we're
going to live now.

377
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:54,000
We're not going to stay
on the<i> Enterprise</i> anymore?

378
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:57,083
No, we're going to live
in a home.

379
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:01,125
Just like we used to
on Earth.

380
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:04,083
You'll see.

381
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,792
I promise.

(<i> door chimes</i> )

383
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,125
Lieutenant Worf,
did they tell you?

384
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,542
It was a mistake.

385
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,542
She didn't die.

386
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,500
She's alive.

387
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,750
Jeremy, come here.

388
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:24,792
Lieutenant Worf,
it's all right.

389
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,792
I'm here for the boy.

390
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,375
Lieutenant Worf
to Captain Picard.

391
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:31,583
Go ahead.

392
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:35,834
Lieutenant Aster
is in her quarters.

393
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,250
Repeat, Worf?

394
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,875
Lieutenant Aster is here.

395
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:41,917
In her quarters, with the boy.

396
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:43,208
PICARD:
Do not provoke her

397
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,458
or interfere in any way
until I arrive.

398
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,250
Picard out.

399
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,500
Number One, have security
moving that way

400
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:53,208
but tell them
to keep their distance.

401
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,875
You have the Bridge.

402
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:57,375
Counselor.

403
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,875
There is nothing
to worry about.

404
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:08,166
I'm going to take care of
Jeremy and make him happy.

405
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,834
It's time to go.

406
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,458
Where are you taking the child?

407
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,208
To the planet.

408
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,625
Come, Jeremy.

409
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:24,500
Worf to Picard.

410
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:25,834
They're leaving their quarters.

411
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,166
Captain, I believe we're headed
for Transporter Room 3.

412
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,667
We're on our way.

413
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,041
Chief O'Brien.

414
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,000
Jeremy and I are going
down to the surface.

415
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:55,625
Who are you?

416
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:57,750
I'm Marla Aster.

417
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:58,750
It's my mother, Captain.

418
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,333
She's alive.

419
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:01,792
What do you want?

420
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,166
To take my child
down to the planet.

421
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,375
I cannot permit that.

422
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:07,375
The boy is my responsibility.

423
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,875
I'm here to care for him.

424
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:12,458
He needs me.

425
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,875
Why do you resist?

426
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:18,166
Because I don't know
who or what you are.

427
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:20,250
Can't you see who it is,
Captain?

428
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:23,667
Jeremy, she appears to be
your mother, but she is not.

429
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:27,583
What do you mean?

430
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,000
You're confusing the boy.

431
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,041
Hey!

432
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,458
Wait, stop, no!

433
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,542
No, wait, stop!

434
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:34,667
Mom!

435
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:36,208
Mom?
Mom!

436
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,458
Jeremy.
Wait a minute!

437
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,625
Come on.
Would you just let...

438
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,083
Jeremy...
Let go of me!

439
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,875
She was right there!

440
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:48,125
What did you do to her?

441
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:50,458
Jeremy, I don't know
what that was

442
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,166
but it was not
your mother.

443
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,333
You saw her.

444
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,792
She was here.

445
00:26:55,834 --> 00:26:58,834
Your mother's dead.

446
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:00,458
But I touched her.

447
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,000
She was real.

448
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,458
Why would your real mother

449
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,375
want you to go
down to the planet?

450
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,709
There's nothing there
but dust and rocks.

451
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,875
(<i> cat meows</i> )

452
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,417
It's my house.

453
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,667
It's my house on Earth.

454
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:33,291
Exactly the
way it was.

455
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,291
Remember, Jeremy?

456
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,500
How did you do it?

457
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:40,500
Does it matter?

458
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,583
Yes, it matters.

459
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:50,333
I am trying to understand
your resistance.

460
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,166
You spoke of
rocks and dust

461
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:54,041
on the planet.

462
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:57,125
I decided to show you
what awaits us there.

463
00:27:57,166 --> 00:28:01,667
Why would you create
this fantasy?

464
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:04,417
It's his home.

465
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,917
And it makes you
happy, doesn't it?

466
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:09,458
But it's not real.

467
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,834
Isn't it?

468
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,417
Jeremy...

00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,208

00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,834
He knows me.

472
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,291
It's him.

473
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,959
It's real.

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,083
It's all real.

No, it's not.

476
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:42,458
Could your real mother
just make all this appear?

477
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,583
You must not
stay here.

478
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,375
Come with me.

I can't.

Is the boy in any danger?

I don't think so.

483

00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,208
Help him?

485
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,792
By easing his pain.

486
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:17,500
She's very confused
by our resistance, Captain.

487
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:19,000
Troi, would it be wise

488
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:22,041
to remove Jeremy
from his cabin?

489
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,417
He doesn't want to leave.

490
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:25,917
I would not recommend
taking him by force.

491
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,542
She offers him everything.

492
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:30,083
All we can offer is the cold
reality of his mother's death.

What would you choose?

back your mother,
father, or husband

496
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,458
would any of us
say "no" so easily?

in Jeremy's quarters.

to this from here.

501
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:51,208
Data, can you determine
for certain

502
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,583
that the energy source
from the planet

503
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,583
is powering this creation?

504
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,291
The beam from the planet
is clearly tapping

505
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,125
into the ship's
anti-matter, Captain.

506
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,375
I'd say they're running

507
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:02,125
that manifestation
off our own energy.

508
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:04,291
So there are limits
to her power.

509
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:07,250
She needs the transporter
to get the boy back.

510

So, how do we cut
the puppet's strings?

511
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,250
Increasing the shield's
harmonics to match

512
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:13,166
our own anti-matter
containment fields

513
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:15,041
will probably sever the beam.

514
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,375
Proceed.

515
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:18,250

Jeremy off the ship again.

544
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,250
Acknowledged.

545
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,750
Engineering, this
is La Forge.

546
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,792
Shut down power
to all transporters.

547
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,083
I'm on my way.

548
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,917
Aye, aye, sir.

549
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:52,333
Lieutenant Worf,
to Transporter Room 3.

550
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:59,583
Bridge, seal off Deck Eight,
Corridors "A" and "B."

551
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,417
Engaging force fields, Captain.

552
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:03,125
Transporters down.

553
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,291
Energy force has left
Transporter Room 3.

554
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,792
Security alert, all decks.

555
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:25,709
La Forge, the intruder
may try to reinstate

556
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,959
transporter power.

557
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,500
Understood, Commander.

558
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:58,458
Bridge, release
security force field 8-B.

559
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,333
Hello, Jeremy.

560
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:09,959
How are you?

561
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,542
Are you frightened?

562
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,959
No.

563
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:17,542
Well, a little, sir.

564
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:19,000
Of course.

565
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:21,959
These are frightening things
that are happening

566
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,500
but we won't let anyone
harm you.

567
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:27,041
Counselor why
don't you take the boy

568
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:28,709
to my quarters?

569
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,166
No.

570
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:44,834
It's looking over everything,
Commander...

571
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,375
going to school.

572
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:50,625
Let's just hope
it doesn't

573
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:52,166
blow us to kingdom come

574
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,834
while it's figuring out
how to blow us to kingdom come.

575
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,875
(<i> beeping</i> )

576
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:04,625
Power's back
in Transporter Room 3.

577
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,625
Bypassing to manual override.

578
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:09,875
Shutting it down.

579
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:11,500
WORF:
Transporter is down again.

580
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,583
Keep it down, Geordi,
for as long as you can.

581
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:15,000
Understood, Commander.

582
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:24,250
It is only a matter
of time, Captain

583
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,208
before we can power
the transporters ourselves.

584
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,709
We?

585
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,583
For whom else
do you speak?

586
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,959
The accident
on the surface

587
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,625
was caused by a remnant
of an ancient and tragic era.

588
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:48,250
Two species once
shared this world--

589
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:52,959
one of energy
and one of matter.

590
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,417
The physical beings
you call the Koinonians

591
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:59,542
destroyed themselves
in unending, bitter wars.

592
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,625
The surviving life-forms
on this planet

593
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,709
will not tolerate
any further suffering

594
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,500
as a result
of that dishonorable past.

595
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:11,750
So, they have made
this possible.

596
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:14,333
They have made<i> me</i> possible.

597
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:18,166
I appreciate your motives...

598
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:22,125
but his mother is dead.

599
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,792
He must learn to live with that.

600
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:26,208
I will be every bit
his mother.

601
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,959
But not his mother.

602
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,041
Picard to Lieutenant Worf.

603
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,125
Go ahead, Captain.

604
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:42,041
Will you escort Ensign Crusher
to the Aster quarters?

605
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,083
Yes, sir.

606
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:44,250
Picard out.

607
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:47,750
Your philosophy is curious,
Captain.

608
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:50,750
What is so noble about sorrow?

609
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:54,083
I can provide him an existence
where he will feel no pain

610
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:57,333
no anguish.

611
00:36:57,375 --> 00:37:01,333
It is at the heart of our nature
to feel pain and joy.

612
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:09,834
It is an essential part
of what makes us what we are.

613
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:12,917
He is alone now in your world.

614
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,500
A child...

615
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:16,709
alone.

616
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,792
How can you know

617
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:20,041
he won't be happier with me?

618
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:24,208
For a brief moment in time,
he surely would be.

619
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,917
Any of us in his place
would be.

620
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:31,333
What would Jeremy do
for friends in your world?

621
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,917
He will have
any friends he needs.

622
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:37,875
And will you provide
for his education, his health?

623
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:39,542
His growth?

624
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,667
A career? A wife?

625
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,500
PICARD:
Yes, it's quite an undertaking

626
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:50,250
you're proposing, isn't it?

627
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:53,291
It is our duty
to make him happy again.

628
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,500
Do you honestly believe
he would be happy

629
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:59,625
in... this total fiction

630
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,458
which you wish
to create?

631
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,208
What reason would he have
to live?

632
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,959
What you're offering
him is a memory.

633
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,750
Something to cherish,
not to live in.

634
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,083
It is part of our life cycle

635
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:16,792
that we accept the death
of those we love.

636
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,792
Jeremy must come to terms
with his grief.

637
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:22,000
He must not cover it
or hide away from it.

638
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:23,792
You see, we are mortal.

639
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:27,208
Our time in this universe
is finite.

640
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,166
That is one of the truths

641
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,959
that all humans
must learn.

642
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,166
Acting Ensign Crusher
reporting as ordered, sir.

643
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,041
Yes, come in, Wesley.

644
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:43,959
Please stay,
Lieutenant.

645
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,750
Jeremy...

646
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:57,041
Wesley's father died
on a Starfleet mission

647
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,083
when he was younger
than you are.

648
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,041
TROI:
Wes...

649
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,542
your mother told me

650
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:06,417
you were finding it difficult
to talk to Jeremy.

651
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:08,709
Why is that?

652
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,208
I don't know.

653
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,959
I just don't want
to think about it anymore.

654
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,959
All this has reminded me
so much of that day.

655
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,208
The day I told you
your father had been killed.

656
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,959
As I recall, Wesley,
you took it very well.

657
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,583
WESLEY:
My parents had told me
about the dangers

658
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,583
of Starfleet missions.

659
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:31,792
I knew it could happen.

660
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:33,625
So you were prepared.

661
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:36,709
No, I wasn't prepared at all.

662
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,125
How can anyone
be prepared to hear

663
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:42,959
that a parent is never
coming home again?

664
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,375
I tried to be what everyone
expected of me--

665
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:49,709
brave and mature.

666
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,792
Wesley, are you saying that
you didn't want anybody to see

667
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:55,625
what you were really feeling?

668
00:39:58,166 --> 00:40:00,458
Well, what were you
really feeling?

669
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,417
Like somebody had
kicked me in the head.

670
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:07,166
Somebody?

671
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,250
Go on.

672
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:11,458
You've wanted to tell him
for a long time.

673
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:18,083
I was angry... at you.

674
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,417
Why angry?

675
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,417
Why were you angry
at me, Wesley?

676
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,917
Were you angry at me
because I was the one

677
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:27,458
who had told you your
father was dead?

678
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,083
No.

679
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:31,166
Then why?

680
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:34,417
Because you led the mission.

681
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,875
You came home and
my father didn't.

682
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:43,500
How long were you angry
with the Captain, Wes?

683
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:46,542
For a long time

684
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:50,041
but not anymore, sir.

685
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,875
Not even a little.

686
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,583
So, Jeremy...

687
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,041
you must be
very angry

688
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:01,291
at Lieutenant Worf.

689
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,542
He was in charge of
your mother's mission

690
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,709
just as Captain Picard
was in command

691
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,834
when Wesley's father was killed.

692
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:11,375
Isn't that right?

693
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:14,291
Worf came back.

694
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:17,291
Your mother didn't.

695
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:18,417
Why?

696
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:20,667
Why weren't you
the one who died?

697
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:23,041
Why did it have
to be her?

698
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:25,750
He can't answer that.

699
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:28,583
None of us can.

700
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:32,041
Lieutenant Worf
also lost his parents.

701
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:35,750
WORF:
They were killed in battle
when I was six.

702
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:41,333
When I was alone,
humans helped me.

703
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,500
Let me help you.

704
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,917
The Marla Aster I knew

705
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:48,291
and honored
is not in this room

706
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:51,625
nor does she await you
on the planet.

707
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:55,834
She now only lives here...

708
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:57,625
and here.

709
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:08,917
Join me in the<i> R'uustai,</i>
the bonding.

710
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:13,542
You will become part of my
family now and for all time.

711
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,208
We will be brothers.

712
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:58,083
<i>SoS jIH batlh SoH.</i>

713
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:03,166
What does that mean?

714
00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:08,083
It honors the memory
of our mothers.

715
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:11,834
We have bonded
and our families are stronger.

716
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,375
<i>SoS jIH batlh SoH.</i>
