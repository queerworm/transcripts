00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:05,959
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43510.7:</i>

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,125
<i>The</i> Enterprise
<i>has put in at Rutia IV</i>

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,709
<i>to deliver medical supplies</i>

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,000
<i>following an outbreak</i>
<i>of violent protests.</i>

5
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,667
<i>Although non-aligned,</i>
<i>the planet has enjoyed</i>

6
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:17,500
<i>a long trading relationship</i>
<i>with the Federation.</i>

7
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:19,750
<i>Now, a generation of peace</i>
<i>has ended</i>

8
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:23,000
<i>with terrorist attacks</i>
<i>by Ansata separatists</i>

9
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,834
<i>who are demanding autonomy</i>
<i>and self-determination</i>

10
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,083
<i>for their homeland</i>
<i>on the western continent.</i>

11
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,166
<i>Recreational shore leave</i>
<i>has been prohibited</i>

12
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,208
<i>and all away teams have been</i>
<i>instructed to beam down armed.</i>

13
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:38,333
We have only a few minutes
before our next meeting, Doctor.

14
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,208
It's all right,
we're finished.

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,208
Waiter.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,375
(<i> explosion</i> )

17
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:45,000
(<i> people screaming</i> )

18
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,750
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

19
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,291
Doctor!

20
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,667
SECURITY:
Keep back.

21
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:53,417
CRUSHER:
Put that away.
I'm a doctor.

22
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,083
Just lie still.
Try not to move.

23
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,750
Lieutenant Worf, I need
some bandages, disinfectant--

24
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:04,417
something with
alcohol in it.

25
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,709
Doctor, it is not safe.

26
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,208
That's an order, Lieutenant.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,583
(<i> alarm stops</i> )

28
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,041
SECURITY:
You there,
clear this area.

29
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,959
Don't be afraid.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,083
There's a lot of bleeding,
but it's not as bad as it looks.

31
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,250
The Klingon's right.

32
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,417
These Ansata,
they're madmen.

33
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,917
There could be
another bomb.

34
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,041
(<i> coughs</i> )

35
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,834
Clear this area.
Everyone out...

36
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,667
Doctor, I believe
it would be prudent

37
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,333
to return
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

38
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,291
There are physicians
on this planet.

39
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,917
Who are not here.
I am.

40
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,041
SECURITY:
Everyone out.
This way.

41
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,166
Doctor.

42
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,417
Thank you.

43
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,250
Thank you.

44
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,875
Not at all, Doctor.

45
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,792
Captain,
there has been an incident.

46
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:58,083
A bomb has been detonated
by Ansata terrorists.

47
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,333
Your security status?
Vulnerable, sir.

48
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,583
Transporter Room 3,
lock onto the away team.

49
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,542
Prepare to beam them back.
CREWMAN: Yes, Captain.

50
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,250
Sir, I've recommended
such a course,

51
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,875
but there are several wounded
and Dr. Crusher

52
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:11,125
is insisting on attending to...
I understand.

53
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,500
Picard to Dr. Crusher.
Go ahead.

54
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:16,250
Doctor, Commander Data has
informed me of your situation.

55
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,166
I already know
what you're going to say.

56
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,333
Doctor, will you
at least allow...

57
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,542
The longer we argue, the longer
it's going to take me to save...

58
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,583
Doctor, you are endangering
yourself and the away team.

59
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,125
Captain, I am trying to put life
back into a wounded body

60
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,667
with sleight of hand,
I'm not going anywhere.

61
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,917
Data and Worf
don't have to stay.

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,917
Crusher out.

63
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,834
Transporter Room, do you have
a lock on the away team?

64
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,375
CREWMAN:
Aye, sir. Shall
I transport them?

65
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:44,125
I don't want to be in the
transporter room to greet her.

66
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,750
Commander Data,

67
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:48,041
hold your position until the
Rutian medics arrive.

68
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,750
Aye, sir.

69
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,375
The tricorder is not reading
any other explosive devices

70
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,208
in this vicinity.

71
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,583
SECURITY:
Get out of the way!
Move!

72
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,000
What...

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,709
(<i> yells</i> )

74
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,792
You don't understand,
I'm a...

75
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:52,542
PICARD:
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

76
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,750
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

77
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,417
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

78
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:02,458
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

79
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,834
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

80
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:11,750
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

81
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,583
A transporter would leave
residual ionization in the air.

82
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,875
Our tricorder readings found
no trace after the incident.

83
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:25,041
People don't just appear
and disappear.

84
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,875
There must be some way
to track her.

85
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:29,875
We have been unable to detect
a signal from her communicator.

86
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:31,625
Either it has been deactivated

87
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:34,625
or she is being held
in a shielded location.

88
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,875
Why her?

89
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:37,667
WORF:
Sir, I believe

90
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:40,000
she was the intended target
of the abduction.

91
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,625
Why would they want to take
a Federation hostage?

92
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:43,917
Their fight doesn't involve us.

93
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,709
It does now.

94
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:01,333
You hungry?
You want something to eat?

95
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,041
Doesn't matter to me.

96
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,792
You want to be hungry,
be hungry.

97
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,125
What's your name?

98
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:21,291
You're a doctor
on a Federation starship.

99
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,417
I always wondered
what it would be like

100
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,375
to travel across the galaxy.

101
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:32,250
It's not something
I've exactly had time for.

102
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,125
This isn't the best way
to meet new people, is it?

103
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,125
If you need anything,
ask for me.

104
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,917
My name is Kyril Finn.

105
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,125
They know me.

106
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:11,000
We have no reason to believe
she's been hurt in any way.

107
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,792
In fact, it's more than likely
they will take good care of her

108
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,041
if they want to use her
as a bargaining chip.

109
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,667
Bargaining chip?

110
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,792
The innocent often
become pawns

111
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,166
in conflicts of
this type, Wes.

112
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,375
You see, the Ansata
separatists

113
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:26,917
have been trying for generations
to free themselves

114
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,875
from the rule
of the eastern continent.

115
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,250
And if they can get
the government

116
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,542
just to acknowledges
their demands,

117
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,542
then kidnapping your mother
will have served its purpose.

118
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,542
I think, that's
what they may be after,

119
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,083
but it may not.

120
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,709
Frankly, Wesley,
I don't care.

121
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,750
My only concern
is to get your mother back.

122
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,458
And very shortly,
we shall be leaving

123
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,417
to have a meeting
with the authorities.

124
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,583
Request permission to be
on the away team, sir.

125
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,208
No. You have an important job
to do here.

126
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,000
If we are to free your mother,

127
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,792
then we have to be able to trace
the movements of the terrorists.

128
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:58,041
I want you to work with
the team that are investigating

129
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,125
this new technology of theirs.

130
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,125
(<i> sighs</i> )
I understand.

131
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,917
Report to Mr. Data.

132
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,959
Dismissed.

133
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,083
He needs your
strength right now.

134
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,333
History has shown us

135
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,208
that strength may be useless
when faced with terrorism.

136
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,125
And what exactly
is Ansata policy

137
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,792
with regard to hostages?

138
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:42,709
I doubt if they have one.

139
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,542
They don't usually
take hostages.

140
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,208
These are not people
we're dealing with here.

141
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,667
They're animals.

142
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,959
Fanatics who kill
without remorse or conscience,

143
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,166
who think nothing
of murdering innocent people.

144
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,375
But they could just as easily
have shot her where she stood.

145
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:01,166
Don't ask me
to explain them.

146
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,500
I can't.

147
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,709
The atrocities
that I've seen...

148
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,250
And now they have
this new device

149
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,083
that makes them
even more deadly.

150
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,000
How do I combat an enemy

151
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,959
that fails to register
on any scanner

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,709
until they're literally
standing in front of you

153
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,959
pointing a phaser
at your head?

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,083
What can you tell us
about this device?

155
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,750
Not much really.

156
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,709
They first started
using it two months ago.

157
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,166
We've taken several of these
off dead terrorists.

158
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,750
Our people have
looked at them.

159
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:29,208
Nothing they
can explain.

160
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,917
Do you mind if we take
one of these with us

161
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,417
and have our people
study it?

162
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,166
Not at all.

163
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,166
And I'll put you in touch with
our research people if you wish.

164
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,291
I appreciate your help.

165
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,667
Perhaps if we found
ourselves in possession

166
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:45,500
of some of that advanced
Federation weaponry of yours,

167
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:49,000
it would shift the balance
of power back to our favor.

168
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,083
Of course, you know
that is out of the question.

169
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,959
Yes, of course.

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,166
I would like to leave
Commander Riker here

171
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,333
to assist in your search
for Dr. Crusher.

172
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,792
If you like.

173
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,959
You don't sound
very optimistic.

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,166
I know my enemy, Commander.

175
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,625
They don't leave much room
for optimism.

176
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:20,375
You hungry?
You want something to eat?

177
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,792
Relax, relax.

178
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:35,041
I'm just going to...

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,125
Now, eat something.

180
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,458
What's the point
of not eating?

181
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,709
You're the only one
who suffers.

182
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,792
Do I look like
it's bothering me?

183
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,583
Okay, it's bothering me.

184
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,166
Come on.

185
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,875
No forks, sorry.

186
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:18,250
Did I mention my name is Finn?

187
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,625
And you're...

188
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,083
Why have you brought me here?

189
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,709
I need a doctor.

190
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,792
There are doctors on Rutia.

191
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,250
I need somebody better.

192
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,875
I heard you were
with the Federation flagship

193
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,542
and I knew you had to be.

194
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,250
Who told you that?

195
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,667
I heard.

196
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:38,125
Now you'll help me
just like you helped them.

197
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,250
What are you talking about?

198
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:49,291
Your ship carries
medical supplies for them--

199
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,792
for the other side.

200
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:53,500
Why does the Federation
ally itself with the Rutians?

201
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,291
We don't.

202
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,875
All we did was bring--
Medical supplies.

203
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,500
People were hurt.
I know.

204
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,208
I hurt them.

205
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:07,125
You're finished eating.
Get up.

206
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,208
Get up.

207
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,041
I have a son.

208
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,834
You'll be with him
again, Doctor.

209
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,542
I see no reason to kill you.

210
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,458
(<i> moaning</i> )

211
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,125
I need some instruments
from my ship

212
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,792
in order to diagnose this.

213
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:06,500
And you think if I allow
you to contact your ship

214
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,291
they will transport
the instruments?

215
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,375
When I inform the Captain
how serious the situation is,

216
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,291
I'm sure he'll agree.

217
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,291
I've told you, Finn,
the Federation is not allied
with the Rutians.

218
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,041
We're here
on an errand of mercy.

219
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,625
And since the Federation
does not wish to take sides,

220
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,417
they will send
the supplies that you need.
Absolutely.

221
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,792
I've anticipated
your needs.

222
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,709
These are Federation supplies.

223
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,166
The ones we had delivered
to the medical dispensary.

224
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,125
I heard.

225
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,500
You mean to tell me all these
people belong to the Ansata?

226
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:49,834
No, not really.

227
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,583
We suspect
the organization itself

228
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,166
only to consist
of some 200 members.

229
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,041
There are over 5,000
names on this list.

230
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,959
Citizens we know to be
sympathetic to their cause.

231
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,125
They pass along weaponry
and information

232
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,583
march in pro-Ansata
demonstrations

233
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,333
participate in
general strikes

234
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,000
or the occasional riot.

235
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,750
How did this ever
get started?

236
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,917
70 years ago,
we denied them independence.

237
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,375
That gave them
a noble cause.

238
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:23,417
Now it's just an excuse
for more violence.

239
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,709
You hate them as much
as they hate you.

240
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,834
Believe it or not,

241
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,125
I always considered
myself moderate.

242
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,417
What changed your mind?

243
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,709
Being stationed here
for six months

244
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,166
watching the body count grow.

245
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,458
The three assassination
attempts on my life.

246
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,375
Well, that'll change
your point of view.

247
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,458
The event that really
opened my eyes

248
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,834
took place only a few
days after my arrival.

249
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,125
A terrorist bomb
destroyed a shuttlebus.

250
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,208
60 schoolchildren.

251
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,667
There were no survivors.

252
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:05,458
The Ansata claimed
that it was a mistake--

253
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,417
that their intended target
was a police transport.

254
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,417
As if that made
everything all right.

255
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,333
That day, I vowed
that I would put an end

256
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,542
to terrorism in this city...

257
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,709
and I will.

258
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,458
Thank you.

259
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,834
You're very helpful.

260
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,709
You could learn to do this
when you grow up.

261
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:40,333
<i>If</i> you grow up.

262
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,333
They're dying.

263
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,041
I'm seeing a complicated
set of conditions.

264
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,458
Their DNA is warped somehow

265
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,417
and it's distorting their
entire cellular chemistry.

266
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,834
You can't do anything?

267
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,125
I can make them more
comfortable, that's all.

268
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,750
The damage is too extensive.

269
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:15,959
(<i> inaudible</i> )

270
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:21,125
If I could detect their
condition earlier...

271
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,625
You could reverse
the damage?

272
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,083
Perhaps.
I don't know.

273
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,917
What happened
to them?

274
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,583
It's the inverter.

275
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,458
It's given our cause a new life

276
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,959
but... it asks
for our lives in return.

277
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,041
What does it do?

278
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,542
We transport through
a dimensional shift

279
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,125
that the Rutian
sensors can't trace.

280
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,250
Dimensional shifting?

281
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,583
You can't do that
with humanoid tissue.

282
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,792
There are risks,
the designers told us,

283
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:57,458
but... it works.

284
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,583
You're showing the same
distorted readings.

285
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,750
Not as severe
as the others, but...

286
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,583
Doesn't matter.

287
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,333
It does if it kills you.

288
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,875
Don't you know?

289
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:14,208
A dead martyr is worth
10 posturing leaders.

290
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:26,375
A subspace field coil with
an isolated power source.

291
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:28,375
Curious.

292
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:30,792
Hey, guys,
come here.

293
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,250
Look at this.

294
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,834
The Rutian team picked up
a faint nuclear vibration

295
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,417
during the terrorist movements.

296
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,000
Nuclear vibration?

297
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,417
That could
possibly indicate

298
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,542
subspace transition rebound
during transport.

299
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,834
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

300
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,834
May I?
Mm-hmm.

301
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,125
Computer, call up
the files on...

302
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,750
Oh, what was his name?

303
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:56,041
We spent two hours on him
in astral physics last year.

304
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,917
Uh... folded-space transport.

305
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,500
Adaptive transport?
Yes.

306
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,208
Are you referring
to the Elway theorem?

307
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,875
Yes. Computer, call up
the files on the Elway theorem.

308
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,000
What if they're using
inter-dimensional travel?

309
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,000
But the Elway theorem proved
to be entirely inaccurate.

310
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,792
All research was abandoned
by the mid-23rd century.

311
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,208
But, Data, look-- the nuclear
vibrations are the same

312
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,125
and Elway used a model
similar to this.

313
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,834
It would certainly
be untraceable

314
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,375
by any standard method
of detection.

315
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:22,083
But it was proven
to be fatal.

316
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,792
To use this technology
would be an irrational act.

317
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,041
We may be dealing with
irrational people, Data.

318
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,750
Is there a way
to trace this?

319
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:31,417
With an adaptive
subspace echogram, maybe.

320
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,875
Captain, anyone who is willing
to transport in this manner

321
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:36,750
would suffer significant
internal damage

322
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,208
that could be detected.

323
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,166
Hmm. It sounds as though
they may require

324
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,875
the services...
of a doctor.

325
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,083
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

326
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,417
Excuse me.

327
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,917
(<i> indistinct</i>
<i>radio transmission</i> )

328
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,667
This is no way to live.

329
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:08,250
For us or them?

330
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,500
For both of you.

331
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,834
I know it's
not pretty, Riker,

332
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,208
but this is what terrorism
has done to this city.

333
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,667
There's got to be a better way
to deal with it than this.

334
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:19,458
My methods may seem harsh
but, believe me,

335
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,959
they're gentle compared
to my predecessors.

336
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,917
Suspects would be brought
into police headquarters

337
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,291
and mysteriously vanish.

338
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,750
I put a stop to that.

339
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:32,000
What happened
to your predecessors?

340
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,083
They were murdered.

341
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:38,583
Are you going to tell me that
little boy's a threat?

342
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,875
It's possible.

343
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:44,041
That shuttlebus
I told you about?

344
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,000
The bomb was set
by a teenager.

345
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,917
In a world where children
blow up children,

346
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:53,083
everyone's a threat.

347
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,834
It's okay.
Over there.

348
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:20,291
You should be drawing,
not killing people.

349
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,208
I can do both.

350
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,542
How can you have such a casual
attitude toward killing?

351
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,417
I take my killing
very seriously, Doctor.

352
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,041
You are an idealist.

353
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,625
I live in an ideal culture.

354
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,000
There's no need for
your kind of violence.

355
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,709
We've proven that.

356
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,083
Your origins on Earth

357
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,709
are from the American
continent, are they not?

358
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,959
North America.

359
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,208
Yes, I've read
your history books.

360
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,500
This is a war
for independence

361
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,917
and I am no different than your
own George Washington.

362
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,959
Washington was a military
general, not a terrorist.

363
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,709
The difference between
generals and terrorists, Doctor,

364
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,834
is only the difference
between winners and losers.

365
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,667
You win, you're called
a general, you lose...

366
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:12,542
You are killing
innocent people.

367
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,125
Can't you see the immorality
of what you're doing?

368
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:18,834
Or have you killed so much
you've become blind to it?

369
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,917
How much innocent blood
has been spilled

370
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,583
for the cause of freedom

371
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,709
in the history
of your Federation, Doctor?

372
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,667
How many good
and noble societies

373
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:30,458
have bombed civilians in war,
have wiped out whole cities?

374
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,375
And now that you enjoy
the comfort that has come

375
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,291
from their battles,
their killing,

376
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,625
you frown on
my immorality?

377
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:41,709
I am willing to die
for my freedom, Doctor.

378
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,875
And in the finest tradition
of your own great civilization,

379
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:49,375
I'm willing to
kill for it, too.

380
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,667
All right,
you can go.

381
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,583
SECURITY:
Next man.

382
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,625
If you want, I could
become more persuasive.

383
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,208
No.

384
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,208
You're Katik Shaw,
the waiter from the Lumar Cafe.

385
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,041
You witnessed both the explosion
and the kidnapping.

386
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,041
I saw nothing.

387
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,375
We're aware of your ties
with the Ansata.

388
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,417
For all we know,
you planted the bomb yourself.

389
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,208
Where have they
taken her?

390
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,917
I don't know
what you're talking about.

391
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,417
I've had enough of this.

392
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,125
I want you to take a message
back to your people.

393
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,834
You tell them the Federation
is willing to negotiate

394
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,458
for the release of
Dr. Crusher.

395
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,166
Riker!

396
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,458
She's a Starfleet officer
and she's my responsibility.

397
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,667
If your people have terms,
we're willing to listen.

398
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:49,750
We want her back.
It's as simple as that.

399
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:53,583
I don't think it's necessary
to detain this gentleman
any longer.

400
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,875
Get out.

401
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,750
I should have
him followed,

402
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:09,417
but we'll try it your way.

403
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,792
Is that what you want?

404
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:13,834
What I want...

405
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,917
is to go home.

406
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:18,125
Back to my own country.

407
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:21,208
To leave behind the roundups,
the interrogations,

408
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,417
the bodies
lying in the street.

409
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,375
To be able to walk
without the bodyguards.

410
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,834
And not to have to jump
at every unexpected noise.

411
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,041
<i>That's</i> what I want, Riker.

412
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,792
A dimensional jump
can create

413
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:44,500
subspace pressure
modulation, Captain.

414
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:46,583
By setting up
a magnetosphere echogram

415
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,375
that can monitor each
of their movements,

416
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:50,000
we may be able to
collect enough data

417
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,625
to trace their
power source.

418
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:54,500
Can you estimate the number
of jumps it would take?

419
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:57,291
Dimensional shifting is such
an unstable procedure, sir,

420
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:01,166
that I cannot say.

421
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:04,166
Sir, I am finding it
difficult

422
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:07,250
to understand many aspects
of Ansata conduct.

423
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,208
Much of their behavioral norm
would be defined by my program

424
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,458
as unnecessary
and unacceptable.

425
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,583
Mm-hmm. By my "program,"
as well, Data.

426
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,625
But if that
is so, Captain,

427
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,542
why are their methods
so often successful?

428
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:23,417
I have been reviewing the
history of armed rebellion.

429
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,083
And it appears
that terrorism

430
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:28,166
is an effective way to
promote political change.

431
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:32,083
Yes, it can be, but I have
never subscribed to the theory

432
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,125
that political power flows
from the barrel of a gun.

433
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,333
Yet, there are
numerous examples

434
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,250
when it was successful.

435
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:42,083
The independence of the
Mexican State from Spain,

436
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,583
the Irish Unification
of 2024,

437
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:45,875
and the Kenzie Rebellion.

438
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,583
Yes, I'm aware of them.

439
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,208
Then would it be
accurate to say

440
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,792
that terrorism<i> is</i> acceptable
when all options

441
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:54,542
for peaceful settlement
have been foreclosed?

442
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

443
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,333
Data, these are questions
that mankind

444
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,458
has been struggling with
throughout history.

445
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,750
Your confusion is...

446
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,709
only human.

447
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,291
Finn, everyone
is being rounded up.

448
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,625
Because of her?

449
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,834
The Federation wants
to negotiate a release.

450
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,625
While they arrange
for the Rutian police

451
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,834
to fill up
the detention cells.

452
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,417
A Starfleet officer
is working with the director.

453
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,041
He wants a meeting with you.

454
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,625
Oh, I'm sure he does.

455
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:35,166
Your Federation colleagues
have engineered mass arrests

456
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,667
to pressure me
into releasing you.

457
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:39,417
I'm sure you've
misunderstood.

458
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,542
They're working with the police.
He's seen it with his own eyes.

459
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,083
All they want
is to get me back safely.

460
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,542
I'm not releasing you.

461
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,709
I need you here.

462
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,208
To find a way to
reverse the effects

463
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,458
of the dimensional shift?

464
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,542
I can do that right now.

465
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,041
Stop using it.

466
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,333
I have a life, Finn.
I have a son who needs me.

467
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,417
Is your son
on the ship?
Yes.

468
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

469
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,041
I'm sorry
he's on the ship.

470
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,750
No.

471
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:15,208
They have joined forces
with the Rutians against us.

472
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,583
We are not your enemy.

473
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,917
They are more valuable
to me than an enemy.

474
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:22,125
For 70 years, we have shouted
and no one has heard us.

475
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,041
Destroy the Federation flagship,
someone will listen.

476
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,375
Please...
<i>They</i> are the ones
who interfered.

477
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,166
They are the ones who
sent medical supplies.

478
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,959
They are the ones who
organized mass arrests.

479
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,333
<i>They</i> are killing
your son, not me.

480
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:39,166
Please, Finn, don't do this.

481
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:42,542
I will do anything you ask.

482
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:47,166
I had a son, too.

483
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:52,500
He was 13 when he died
in detention.

484
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,875
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

485
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:12,083
What?

486
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,959
(<i> screams</i> )

487
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,041
(<i> console beeps</i> )
Intruder alert, deck 12.

488
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:22,375
Another subspace reflection.
Dimensional shift, sir.

489
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,333
Go to Red Alert.
Sound general quarters.

00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:36,583
(<i> yelling</i> )

492
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,667
Security to Engineering!

493
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,709
Intruders in Engineering.

494
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,667
Casualties reported
on deck 12.

495
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:47,959
Sick Bay responding.

496
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,291
Seal off all decks.

497
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,000
Lock on transporters
to intruder signals.

498
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,875
CREWMAN:
Intruder signals unstable,
Captain.

499
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:54,125
I cannot lock on.

500
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,959
They are moving
interdimensionally.

501
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,875
Neither transporters nor force
fields will contain them, sir.

502
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:09,041
(<i> ticking</i> )

503
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,875
Explosive charge
on the main warp chamber.

504
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:26,625
Transporter Room 3,

505
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,875
lock on to the explosive device
and energize.

506
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,625
CREWMAN:
It's scrambling
the sensors, Captain.

507
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,959
I can't pinpoint it.
Begin emergency evacuation.

508
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,583
Stand by for saucer separation.

509
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:37,542
Mr. La Forge, can you remove
the charge from the engine core?

510
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,625
I'm trying. Hold on.

511
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,959
They've got it
locked on somehow.

512
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Stand by.

513
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,875
Transporter Room,
lock on my signal

514
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:58,250
and stand by to transport

515
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:00,542
two kilometers
off the starboard nacelle.

518
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,500
Mr. La Forge, report.

519
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,917
Transport complete, Captain.

520
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,625
I have a man down.

521
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,500
More dimensional shifts, sir.

522
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,291
PICARD:
Can you calibrate
their destination?

523
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:22,041
No, sir, the readings are...

00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:23,041
Lieutenant Worf is
recovering in Sick Bay.

528
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,959
The wound was
not severe.

529
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,542
Dead? Injured?

530
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,750
Three dead, four wounded.

531
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:31,750
Another millisecond
and there would have been

532
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:34,542
a big dust cloud orbiting Rutia
instead of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

533
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,375
Why?

534
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,000
I just asked
if they would talk.

535
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:41,125
You have
your answer, Riker.

536
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,125
WESLEY:
Sir.

537
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:44,875
The next time the Ansata
use their dimensional jump,

538
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:47,000
we should be able to get a fix
on the power source.

539
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:51,917
Worf went down.

540
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:53,875
I don't know if
he's alive or dead.

541
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,834
And there were
other casualties.

542
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,834
Was Wes on the Bridge?

543
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:01,625
Yes.

544
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,542
He took cover.

545
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:06,166
I didn't see
any more than that.

546
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:09,500
But you are
all right, though?

547
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,917
Yes, they needed
a doctor.

548
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:14,542
Uh-huh. The side effects
of the transport.

549
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,041
Yes.

550
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,834
We're getting closer to
tracing their movements.

551
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,500
Actually, it was
Wesley who put us

552
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:24,083
onto this dimensional
jump of theirs.

553
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:26,542
He has been
extraordinary, Beverly.

554
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:30,166
He's going to make
a very fine officer.

555
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:33,083
He's had good role models.

556
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:42,792
I'm sorry. If I'd only gone
back to the ship...

557
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,667
I should have
beamed you up.

558
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:45,959
You wouldn't dare.

559
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,875
Oh, yes, I would...
and should.

560
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:49,125
Without my permission?

561
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,500
If you don't
follow orders...

562
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,250
If you'd give reasonable
orders, I'd obey.

563
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:55,333
Doctor, I will be the judge
of what is reasonable.

564
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:06,667
There aren't any exits
to the surface.

565
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:10,000
So the only way out
is by the transporter

566
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:12,208
or the dimensional jump.

567
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,000
A mode of travel
I'd encourage you to avoid.

568
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:18,250
It's killing them.

569
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:20,583
They're mad.

570
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:23,667
I don't know anymore.

571
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,041
The difference
between a madman

572
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:29,250
and a committed man
willing to die for a cause...

573
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:33,792
it's all become blurred
over the last few days.

574
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:36,583
Beverly, I don't
have to remind<i> you</i>

575
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,959
of the psychological impact
of being a hostage.

576
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,834
I know.
I understand that.

577
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:45,917
But their leader, Finn,
he's not what you'd expect.

578
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:48,208
No, he's certainly not
what I would expect.

579
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,834
Without cause or reason,

580
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,291
he and his little band of
outlaws have attacked my ship.

581
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,041
But he did have reasons.

582
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,959
The medical supplies,
the arrests...

583
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,166
Jean-Luc, if we really examined
our role in all this...

584
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:01,959
Beverly, you are
arguing for a man

585
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:03,750
who may have
murdered your son.

586
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:09,458
I didn't kill
your son,<i> Beverly.</i>

587
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,125
We weren't able
to destroy the ship.

588
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,792
We had to settle for him.

589
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:16,667
She wouldn't even
tell me her name.

590
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:18,750
I call her Doctor.

591
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,792
You have made a grave
miscalculation.

592
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,125
Oh?

593
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,333
You've assaulted
a Federation starship,

594
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,667
killed and wounded several
members of her crew,

595
00:33:26,709 --> 00:33:28,667
kidnapped two
of her officers,

596
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:30,625
and you don't
expect a response?

597
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,959
On the contrary,
I'm counting on it.

598
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,750
You want Federation
involvement?

599
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,041
Captain,

600
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,291
the Federation has
a lot to admire in it,

601
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:44,458
but there's a hint
of moral cowardice

602
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,041
in your dealings
with non-aligned planets.

603
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:50,709
You're doing business with a
government that is crushing us.

604
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,208
And you say
you're not involved.

605
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,917
You're very,
very much involved.

606
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,542
You just don't want
to get dirty.

607
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,083
You accuse us
of cowardice

608
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,166
while you plant
bombs in shadows?

609
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,625
I am fighting
the only war that I can

610
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:08,083
against an intractable enemy.

611
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:10,083
Now, I'm fighting a big war

612
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:12,709
against a more
powerful adversary.

613
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,000
Can't you see
how that helps me?

614
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:17,041
I'm afraid<i> I</i> can't.

615
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:20,792
He's added another chair
to the negotiating table.

616
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:23,125
<i>You</i> added the chair, Captain.

617
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:26,041
I am simply forcing you
to sit in it.

618
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,667
The Federation will quickly tire
of our little war.

619
00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:30,250
They'll want you back.

620
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:34,000
They will want to get
as far from Rutia as they can

621
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,917
and I will not make it easy.

622
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:38,542
Eventually, the Federation
will force the government

623
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,709
into making concessions,

624
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,959
and then a few more,
and then... a few more.

625
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,792
Until we can finally reach
an honorable agreement

626
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:50,792
that saves face
for all sides--

627
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:54,417
except... we win.

628
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:58,291
You understand, I will not
cooperate with you in any way.

629
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:01,834
You've already cooperated,
Captain...

630
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,083
just by coming here.

631
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,667
(<i> gasps</i> )

632
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:18,083
I am not here to hurt you.

633
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,208
Just hear what I have to say.

634
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,041
Your people are safe.

635
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:24,709
How long they stay that way
depends on you.

636
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,250
We demand an embargo
and trade sanctions

637
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,792
levied against Rutia.

638
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:32,458
The Federation
will blockade the planet.

639
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,333
No ships will be
allowed in or out.

640
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,709
This will continue
until the government of Rutia

641
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,208
consents to talks mediated
by a Federation counsel.

642
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,500
You have 12 hours
to make your decision.

643
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,083
(<i> console beeping</i> )

644
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,750
Got it.

645
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,917
We've pinpointed
the Ansata base

646
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,917
as some 300 kilometers
from the city

647
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:04,458
on the southern tip
of the continent.

648
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,166
Sensors indicate
it is located

649
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:09,667
30 meters below the ground,
implying a cavern-like dwelling.

650
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,208
Any passages leading
to the surface?

651
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,834
Our readings show no evidence
of any, Commander.

652
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:18,500
Any light they have must be
artificially generated.

653
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:20,875
If we could
shut that down,

654
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:23,834
you could use the confusion
to find your people.

655
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:27,625
Request permission to join
the rescue party, sir.

656
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,709
I owe it to the Captain.

657
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,333
Permission granted.

658
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:32,875
You have the Bridge,
Mr. Data.

659
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:34,250
Aye, sir.

660
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,959
Commander?

661
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,375
Good luck.

662
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:40,125
We'll bring
them home, Wes.

663
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,333
You're glad to see
your Captain.

664
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,750
Yes.

665
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:12,625
I may have to kill him.

666
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,417
I just wanted
to warn you.

667
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:18,291
He can help you, Finn.
He is very influential...

668
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,875
He will not help us.

669
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:21,500
If you could just
convince him that your...

670
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:24,667
You may be able to
convince him, perhaps, not I.

671
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,583
I've talked to him.

672
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:31,250
I'll try.

673
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,959
If our places were reversed,

674
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,875
I would expect to die.

675
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:42,083
Your places would
never be reversed.

676
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:44,458
He would never
forcibly abduct you

677
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,333
or play games
with your life.

678
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,834
He would treat you
with respect.

679
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:49,458
I've treated you with respect.

680
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,875
You've scared
the hell out of me, Finn!

681
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:53,667
You've controlled me
through fear

682
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:55,917
just like you've tried
to control this whole continent.

683
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:59,250
You haven't tasted
<i>real</i> fear yet, Doctor.

684
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:01,500
Is that the best you can do?

685
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:03,917
Is fear the only weapon
you have?

686
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:06,542
No, but...

687
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,291
it's a good one.

688
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,834
You know what scares me
the most, Finn?

689
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,500
It scares me to think

690
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:20,458
that you might win this fight
and gain real power.

691
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,417
Doctor.

692
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,792
(<i> sighs</i> )

693
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:33,875
I...

694
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:36,625
I don't want you to fear me.

695
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:26,917
(<i> equipment beeping</i> )

696
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,500

697
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:51,291
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

698
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,792
The generator's
right over there.

Were the power packs
distributed?

WOMAN:
Yes, sir.

701
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,792
Beverly, how dangerous
would another ride

702
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:33,208
through the
inverter be to us?

703
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,125
I don't know,

704
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:38,667
but I don't want you
to start thinking about...

705
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:41,125
Beverly, it is our obligation
to think of escape.

706
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:43,250
He's prepared
to kill you.

707
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:45,417
An excellent reason to escape.

708
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:48,166
Do you think you've
gained his confidence?

709
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:53,208
(<i> paper rustles</i> )

710
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:00,417
Indeed, you have.

711
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,375
And more.

712
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:06,917
This might prove
to be an advantage to us.

713
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:09,083
Jean-Luc...

714
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:18,417
There are some things
I want to tell you

715
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:21,417
in case we don't
get out of this.

716
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,208
Have they found us?

717
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,834
(<i> alarm buzzing loudly</i> )

718
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:28,875
MAN:
Right away!

719
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:29,959
WOMAN:
Look out.

720
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,792
MAN:
Samuel!

721
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:33,083
Come with me.

722
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,709
Do we have any emergency power?

723
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:54,792
Freeze!

724
00:41:54,834 --> 00:41:57,542
Hold it right there!
Hands up.

725
00:41:57,583 --> 00:42:00,291
Hands up.
Let's go.

726
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:12,709
Finn...

727
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,750
He's dead.

728
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,792
You didn't have
to kill him.

729
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:41,542
As a prisoner, he would have
been a focus for violence...

730
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:45,750
as his followers
tried to free him.

731
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:48,333
Now he's a martyr.

732
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,709
But the death toll
might go down,

733
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,959
at least,
in the short term.

734
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,166
It's an imperfect solution
for an imperfect world.

735
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,250
Riker!

736
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,083
No more killing.

737
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:34,333
Already another one
to take his place.

738
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:36,083
It never ends.

739
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,917
He could have killed you.

740
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:40,208
He didn't.

741
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:44,208
Maybe the end begins with
one boy putting down his gun.

742
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,458
I hear I owe
my rescue to you.

743
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,083
I was just part
of the team.

744
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,458
It's good
to have you back.

745
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,208
Both of you, sir.

746
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,625
Take us out of orbit,
Mr. Crusher.

747
00:44:21,917 --> 00:44:24,375
PICARD:
At your convenience.
