00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:09,917
(<i> humming jazzy tune</i> )

2
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,333
(<i> door chime</i> )

3
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,709
RIKER:
Come on in.

4
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,250
Excellent.

5
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,083
That's exactly
what I needed.

6
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:39,500
Ah, Mr. Worf.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,959
And the good Doctor
bearing gifts?

8
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,333
Ale from Ennan VI.

9
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,333
Your omelets
deserve no less.

10
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,959
This is not
an efficient method

11
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:49,375
for the preparation
of sustenance.

12
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, you're right, Data.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
The ship's computer
would be more efficient,

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,625
but it wouldn't allow
for the subtlety needed

15
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,000
for great cooking.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,709
It would give you
all of the ingredients

17
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:59,250
in predetermined
measurements.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,000
It wouldn't allow for
flair or individuality.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,250
And, Data, as we both know,

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,959
flair is what marks
the difference

21
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,917
between artistry
and mere competence.

22
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,625
For much of the history
of mankind,

23
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,000
the breaking of bread

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,291
was a symbol of friendship
and community--

25
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,375
something we've gotten
away from in the 24th century.

26
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:18,917
Ah, you have a practiced
hand, Commander.

27
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:20,667
Yes, I have my father to thank.

28
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:22,417
Your father
liked to cook?

29
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:23,542
No, he hated it.

30
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,542
That's why he left
the chore to me.

31
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:29,875
It is my understanding
that in most human families,

32
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,625
the woman shares
in the cooking.

33
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,375
There were only
the two of us.

34
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,166
I never knew my mother.

35
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,792
She died
when I was very young.

36
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,542
Where did you get these eggs?

37
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:48,041
On our last stop.

38
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,291
At Starbase 73?

39
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,625
Yep.

40
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:53,125
What kind of eggs
did you say these were?

41
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,625
Owon.

42
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,709
For you, Data.

43
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,125
Something special.

44
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,792
Don't be afraid.

45
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:03,125
They won't bite you.

46
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,667
And for you,
Mr. Worf.

47
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,959
(<i> coughs</i> )

48
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,333
A cook is only as good

49
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,709
as his ingredients.

50
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:22,542
(<i> groans</i> )

51
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,041
Delicious.

52
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,667
PICARD:
Number One.

53
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,083
Go ahead.

54
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,417
I'd appreciate you joining me
on the bridge.

55
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:45,166
Right away, sir.

56
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,667
Number One, we've picked up
an automated signal

57
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,083
from a Federation
shuttlecraft.

58
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,417
From a shuttlecraft?
How is that possible?

59
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:58,750
I thought we were

60
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,166
the only manned
Federation vessel out here.

61
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,500
Apparently not.

62
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,375
What's a shuttlecraft
doing out this far?

63
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,792
Where's its mother ship?

64
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:08,041
WORF:
Sensors indicate
there is at least

65
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,750
one life-form aboard
the shuttle, sir-- humanoid.

66
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,667
Perhaps someone to answer
your questions, Number One.

67
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,333
Open hailing frequencies.

68
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,333
Communication
is not possible, sir.

69
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,041
The shuttle is without power.

70
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,333
Set course to intercept.

71
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:25,083
Estimate intercept
in three minutes.

72
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,625
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

73
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:58,792
<i>These are the voyages</i>

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,458
Thank you, Lieutenant.
On screen.

86
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,333
Magnify.

87
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,291
Prepare to lock on
tractor beam.

88
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,083
Target vehicle.

89
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,333
We will be within tractor beam
range in two seconds.

90
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,333
Set automatic locking device.

91
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,792
Alert Shuttle Bay 2.

92

93

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,542
Locking tractor beam.

95
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:15,834
Number One.

96
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,333
You're with me, Mr. Worf.

97
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:25,083
Dr. Pulaski, you are needed
in Shuttle Bay 2.

98
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,000
PULASKI:
I've been monitoring.
I'm on my way.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,417
DATA:
Engage secondary tractor beam.

100
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,166
Well, that's a Federation
shuttlecraft, all right.

101
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,083
Yet, there are
no Federation bases

102
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,709
or vessels in this area.

103
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:05,000
"NCC-1701-D,

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,500

105
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:26,500
"NCC-1701-D, USS<i> Enterprise,</i>
Shuttlecraft 05."

106
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,959
How is this possible?

107
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,250
Commander, come here!

108
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:42,333
Captain?

109
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,709
Yes, Number One?

110
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,500
Are you on the bridge?

111
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,250
Where else would I be?

112
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,458
Well, right now, I think you
should be in Shuttle Bay 2.

113
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,959
Why? What is it?

114
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,667
This, I think,
you should see for yourself.

115
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,166
Bring Commander Data.

116
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,875
Condition?

117
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,458
PULASKI:
The life signs
are very confusing.

118
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,458
His heartbeat is strong,
but the pulse is off.

119
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,250
Is he injured?

120
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,625
There's no signs
of trauma.

121
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,375
Why is he unconscious?

122
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,250
What happened to him?

123
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,041
I can't say.

124
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:50,166
The readings
of his brain waves

125
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,709
are very strange.

126
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,208
Strange?

127
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,792
What way?

128
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,125
Non-human?

129
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,375
Artificial?

130
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,041
No, neither.

131
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,333
They're just out of phase.

132
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,333
Can you revive him?

133
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,542
I wouldn't even
attempt it

134
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:13,375
until we get him
into Sick Bay.

135
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,083
Come on, let's
get him there.

136
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,291
Counselor?

137
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:55,083
I have never felt anything
quite like this before,

138
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:59,125
so it's difficult
to put into words.

139
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,000
That person is you.

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,250
No.

141
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,208
He is as much Jean-Luc Picard

142
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:10,000
as the person
I'm standing next to.

143
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,542
Beyond that, there is
very little I can be sure of.

144
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:16,917
I will have to wait
until he regains consciousness

145
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,333
before knowing more.

146
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,959
Data.

147
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,917
I need to know what's
on the shuttle's logs.

148
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,083
Aye, sir.

149
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,709
Captain, both primary
and reserve power

150
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,750
has been drained
from the shuttle.

151
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,333
I am going to have to connect
to the<i> Enterprise</i> in order

152
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,583
to activate the
shuttle's systems.

153
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,750
Geordi...

154
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,417
report to Shuttle Bay 2
immediately.

155
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,625
I'm on my way.

156
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,375
I'll be in Sick Bay.

157
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,709
Keep me informed.

158
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:51,417
Captain, have you seen this?

159
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,834
It looks like
the damage

160
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:57,458
caused by an anti-matter
explosion.

161
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:01,291
It must have been
just out of range
of the shuttlecraft.

162
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,709
Data, I need those logs.

163
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:05,625
Counselor.

164
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:14,250
We'll be on the bridge.

165
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,625
Lieutenant.

166
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:23,041
Resume course and speed.

167
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,250
Scanners at maximum range.

168
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,834
Maximum range.

169
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,250
There you go.

170
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,250
You should have power now.

171
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,875
Ooh, what happened?

172
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,250
The polarity is
not compatible.

173
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,625
That's not possible.

174
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,125
The connection's
idiot-proof.

175
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,417
The power requirements
of the shuttle

176
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,625
do not match those
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

177
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,917
We will need a variable
phase inverter

178
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:03,375
to align the power
from the<i> Enterprise</i>

179
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,750
to the circuits
of the shuttle.

180
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,208
Data, what do you think
is going on here?

181
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,208
I don't mean
just with the shuttle.

182
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,792
I mean everything.

183
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:15,291
I do not have
enough information.

184
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:30,583
I'm just starting
a complete medical work-up.

185
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,709
His vital signs
are distorted.

186
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,250
Some of the indicators
are totally depressed.

187
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,333
Others are
fluctuating wildly.

188
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,834
I can't explain any of it.

189
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,542
But he is alive.

190
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:53,458
The restraints are
for his own protection.

191
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,750
Have you been able to determine
why he's still unconscious?

192
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,291
No, but I have been able
to rule out any head injury.

193
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,834
Wake him.

194
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:44,291
What happened?

195
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:50,542
Apparently, the normal stimulant
had the opposite effect.

196
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:54,250
I'll have to try something else.

197
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,750
All right, Data.

198
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:09,458
I think I've
got it now.

199
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,834
That ought to give
you something.

200
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:15,500
Making this
power adjustment
is very tricky.

201
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,709
By all rights,
this connection

202
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:20,959
should blow all the
shuttle's circuits.

203
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,375
Perhaps you had better
step out of the way.

204
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,542
All right.

205
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:27,166
But, remember,

206
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,667
you're not indestructible
yourself, you know.

207
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,917
Increase the power.

208
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:46,375
Powering up.

209
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:50,375
Adjust the inverter
two percent positive.

210
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,792
Two percent positive.

211
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,083
It was the right decision,

212
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,375
but it's having
the opposite effect.

213
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,583
Yes.

214
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,208
I don't understand.

215
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,375
I can't think of anything
that would cause the circuit

216
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,250
to change so radically.

217
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:11,291
Adjust the inverter
two percent negative.

218
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,834
Okay.

219
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:17,250
Two percent negative.

220
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:20,875
That's it.

221
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:24,291
It shouldn't work,
but it does.

222
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,291
Hey, Data...

223
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,834
take a look
at the Stardate.

224
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,709
42679.5.

225
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:36,333
Captain.

226
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,834
Go ahead.

227
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:40,917
Captain, we've been able
to reactivate the shuttle

228
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:43,166
and the on-board clock
indicates that the shuttle

229
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,375
is six hours in front of us.

230
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,000
Captain, do you read me?

231
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If the shuttle is
from six hours into the future,

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,875
then so is
the other Captain Picard.

233
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:05,875
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

234
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,250
<i>Part of the mystery</i>
<i>has been solved.</i>

235
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,667
<i>The reason there are two</i>
<i>number 05 shuttlecrafts</i>

236
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:13,375
<i>is because one of them</i>
<i>is from the future.</i>

237
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,583
<i>Six hours to be exact.</i>

238
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,875
<i>And so, presumably,</i>
<i>is the facsimile of me.</i>

239
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,417
Try and wake him again.

240
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,166
No.

241
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,208
It's only a sedative.

242
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,333
I know what it is.

243
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,875
Don't sedate him.
Let him be.

244
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,083
Please.

245
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,834
Let him remain conscious.

246
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,333
I've never seen
anything like this.

247
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:31,875
Are you all right?

248
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,083
I'm fine, Doctor.

249
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,291
Save your ministrations
for your patient.

250
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,458
I want a staff meeting
in five minutes.

251
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,792
Doctor, I assume
you will want to remain here?

252
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:43,583
Yes, I will monitor
the conference from here.

253
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:47,000
Keep me informed.

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,709
Of any changes,
no matter how small.

00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,083
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

256
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,041
<i>I've been informed</i>
<i>that Mr. Data</i>

257
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,333
<i>has recovered the logs from</i>
<i>the duplicate shuttlecraft.</i>

258
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,333
<i>I am more than apprehensive</i>
<i>to play back a log</i>

259
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,500
<i>which will not be recorded</i>
<i>for several hours.</i>

260
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,667
Captain, we've retrieved
all we're going to get

261
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,458
out of the shuttle logs,

262
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,834
including
the last visual records.

263
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:25,125
Everything before that
is just a jumble.

264
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,458
Show me.

265
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:32,875
The distortion is because
we had to use a phase inverter

266
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,166
to retrieve the logs.

267
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,375
The quality will improve...
slightly.

268
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,583
According to the shuttle log,
the<i> Enterprise</i> was destroyed

269
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,959
three hours,
19 minutes from now.

270
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,542
LA FORGE:
Captain...

271
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:19,041
we also have a portion
of the last log entry.

272
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,583
It's audio only.

273
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,041
Captain's Personal Log,
supplemental.

274
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,750
I have just witnessed

275
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,375
the total destruction
of the USS<i> Enterprise</i>

276
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,917
with a loss of all hands,
save one--

277
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,166
me.

278
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,750
All attempts to obtain
further information

279
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,291
from the shuttle have failed.

280
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,792
Well, at least now
we have something to go on.

281
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:51,000
LA FORGE:
I just don't understand
how you could have

282
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
ended up in a shuttlecraft

283
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,834
while the<i> Enterprise</i>
was being destroyed.

284
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:55,875
Nor I.

285
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,166
The last thing you would do

286
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,583
is leave the bridge
of the<i> Enterprise</i>

287
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,375
during an emergency.

288
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,458
Yes.

289
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,500
All right, let's
proceed on the premise

290
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,250
that what we have just seen
happened

291
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,291
and that, in less
than four hours from now,

292
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:21,083
the<i> Enterprise</i> will be destroyed

293
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:26,417
and, somehow,
although this is unfathomable,

294
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:28,875
I, and I alone, escape.

295
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,333
Discussion.

296
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,875
RIKER:
Our destination
is the Endicor system.

297
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,417
We're due to arrive
in three days.

298
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:36,166
The charts show nothing
of consequence,

299
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,291
certainly nothing
to threaten the<i> Enterprise</i>

300
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,625
between here and there.

301
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,125
Sensors indicated
no other vessels--

302
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,583
Federation or otherwise--
in this area.

303
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,000
Data?

304
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,500
I have nothing to offer.

305
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,333
There is not enough information

306
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,458
upon which to base
an hypothesis.

307
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,625
LA FORGE:
Well, the shuttle
apparently came

308
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,000
from somewhere up ahead.

309
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,041
So, rather than continuing
on this course,

310
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,875
maybe we should stop here

311
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,041
and let whatever it is
out there come to us.

312
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,750
RIKER:
We may already
be too late.

313
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,041
What are you saying?

314
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,083
That stopping,
turning right or left,

315
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,542
even reversing our course
would be pointless?

316
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:13,125
When we brought the shuttle
and the other Picard onboard,

317
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,250
we committed
to a sequence of events

318
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,083
which may be unalterable.

319
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,041
PICARD:
Yes, this is not some...

320
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,083
rock on the trail

321
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,333
which once seen
can easily be avoided.

322
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,875
This is much
more complex.

323
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,709
There is the theory
of the Mobius--

324
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:34,583
a twist in the fabric of space
where time becomes a loop

325
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,917
from which there
is no escape.

326
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,458
So, when we reach that point,

327
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,166
whatever happened
will happen again--

328
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,000
the<i> Enterprise</i> will be
destroyed,

329
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,375
the other Picard will be
sent back to meet with us,

330
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,375
and we do it all over again.

331
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,875
Sounds like someone's idea
of hell to me.

332
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,625
Well, I know this much--
we can't avoid the future.

333
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,834
Agreed.

334
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:55,959
So let's continue on course.

335
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:59,041
Somewhere out there
something will happen.

336
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,000
A decision will be made

337
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,333
during the course
of which

338
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,166
I will be separated
from the<i> Enterprise.</i>

339
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,417
At the time,
the decision will seem

340
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:08,583
to be correct,
but it won't be.

341
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,291
We have to anticipate
and not make...

342
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,583
not make the same mistake once.

343
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,750
Something is
waiting for us

344
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,417
out there.

345
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:23,291
Let's try and determine what
it is as quickly as possible.

346
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,667
Doctor?

347
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,750
I'm just beginning
to realize

348
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,083
how much of the body

349
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:01,834
is held together by its
own internal clock.

350
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:06,250
He was thrown out of time,
which caused his body's systems

351
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,041
to change their rhythms.

352
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:12,250
Now slowly, as we get closer
to the time that he left,

353
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,834
his internal body clock
is realigning.

354
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:18,959
Are you saying
that when our time intersects

355
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:21,291
with the time he left--

356
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:25,750
in that instant, he will
function normally, and...

357
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,083
and there will be two of us?

358
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,166
Right now, that is my guess.

359
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:35,542
Doctor, I don't think
that's possible.

360
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:38,500
I'm able to feel much more
from him now, Captain.

361
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,250
His emotions are still
a jumble, but...

362
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,250
Counselor?

363
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:05,000
He desperately wants
to leave this ship.

364
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,041
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

365
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,667
<i>We continue</i>
<i>on course to Endicor.</i>

366
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:31,709
<i>We are now</i>
<i>less than two hours away</i>

367
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:35,041
<i>from our rendezvous</i>
<i>with ourselves.</i>

368
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,166
Worf.

369
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,583
Maximum scan, sir.

370
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,583
Nothing unusual
to report.

371
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,917
If this timetable
is correct,

372
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:44,083
we could get an indication
of something very soon.

373
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,709
PULASKI:
Bridge, this is Sick Bay.

374
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:47,000
Yes, Doctor.

375
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,500
Captain, my patient
is more coherent.

376
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,083
I'm on my way.

377
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,667
You have the bridge,
Number One.

378
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,083
How is he?

379
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:09,625
His vital signs

380
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:12,333
are more normal, which is
to say, more like ours.

381
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,709
He is calmer.

382
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:15,125
He's aware of me.

383
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,834
Perhaps, in
some fashion.

384
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:20,208
But he knows where he is,
who's here with him?

385
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,166
I doubt it.

386
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,083
What went wrong?

387
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:33,500
You know, don't you?

388
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:42,458
What did you do?

389
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,834
What happened?

390
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,291
Why did you leave the ship?

391
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,125
Don't turn away!
Look at me!

392
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,458
Picard, look at me.

393
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:05,125
Captain, he doesn't
understand you.

394
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,667
He knows I'm here.

395
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:09,709
Yes, but in a nightmare
of disjointed images

396
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:11,875
and half-heard voices.

397
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,208
He's in another dimension

398
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:17,375
looking at us
across a great chasm

399
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,625
and he's feeling remorse
at what he witnessed.

400
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,667
He's afraid.

401
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:25,166
What is he afraid of?

402
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,542
Damn you.

403
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,875
Help me.

404
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,542
Why did you
leave the ship?

405
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,709
It's no use, Captain.

406
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:44,458
He can't answer you.

407
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:51,333
When we get closer to his time,
he may be able to.

408
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,875
You're still
convinced he's me?

409
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,250
Yes, but<i> you're</i>
not convinced.

410
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,000
Not in the slightest.

411
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Except for his features,

412
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,542
there is nothing about him
that I find familiar.

413
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,917
Counselor, I want you
to stay with him.

414
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:12,000
He'll be able to
communicate with you

415
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,792
before anyone else.

416
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:17,291
I don't know how long anyone

417
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,875
could take this kind
of anxiety state.

418
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:22,250
There has to be
a breaking point.

419
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,417
I think he's handling it
very well.

420
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:27,333
He has a lot of anger.

421
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:30,000
Yes, because of what he
represents.

422
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,375
And what is that?

423
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:33,458
Doubt.

424
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:36,166
He's afraid
that seeing him here

425
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,750
and knowing what happened
to the<i> Enterprise</i>

426
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,709
will make him timid,
or worse, make him hesitate.

427
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:46,458
Part of my job is
to anticipate problems.

428
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,625
My duty is
to the Captain

429
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:52,041
but first to the ship
and its crew.

430
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:54,709
Doctor,
the Captain is quite capable

431
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:56,792
of making command decisions.

432
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:58,959
Yes, for now,

433
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:02,083
but this situation has put him
under extreme pressure

434
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:05,208
of a unique
and very personal kind.

435
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,667
We both know

436
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:08,417
that pressure
will only increase.

437
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:12,333
You said yourself
that he already has doubt.

438
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:15,417
Which is understandable
and healthy.

439
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:19,250
And could be
potentially paralyzing.

440
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,500
Now, if we begin to see signs

441
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,709
that he's acting
in an irrational manner,

442
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:27,750
I have the authority
and the duty to relieve him.

443
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,625
I don't think
that will be necessary.

444
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,750
I hope you're right.

445
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,625
What force
or phenomenon

446
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,792
could cause the shuttle
to be thrown back in time?

447
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:30,583
None that we've
encountered.

448
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:33,834
In theory, accelerating
beyond warp ten.

449
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:35,875
Using the gravitational
pull of a star

450
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,208
to slingshot back in time?

451
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,834
Is that what happened here?

452
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:41,583
The shuttle doesn't have
warp capability.

453
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,834
No.

454
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:45,000
So, some external
force was needed.

455
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,834
We've never encountered
a natural force that powerful.

456
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:49,125
Why only six hours?

457
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:52,583
Why not a day or a year?

458
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,792
Are you saying that there was

459
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,208
some conscious mind
at work here?

460
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:59,959
There's no evidence
either way.

461
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:10,458
The Traveler moved through time
using the power of his mind.

462
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:13,083
I don't think
that's the case here.

463
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,208
No.

464
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:18,583
And Manheim's experiments
with gravity and time

465
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:22,834
were rudimentary
and uncontrollable.

466
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:25,041
Captain, I think

467
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:28,291
this is one instance
where you should suppress

468
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,083
your natural tendencies.

469
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,917
Oh, really?

470
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:33,917
One of your
strengths

471
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:38,333
is your ability to evaluate
the dynamics of a situation

472
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:42,959
and then take a definitive,
preemptive step-- take charge.

473
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,750
Now, you're
frustrated

474
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,333
because you not only

475
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:49,583
can't see the solution, you
can't even define the problem.

476
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:50,750
Hmm.

477
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,333
Go on.

478
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:56,208
What we're facing is neither
a person nor a place...

479
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:57,625
at least not yet.

480
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,291
It's time.

481
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,583
You're saying I should just
sit down, shut up and wait.

482
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,375
Well, I wouldn't have
put it exactly like that.

483
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,792
Not something I do easily.

484
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:11,041
Your Persian flaw.

485
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:14,917
Yes, perhaps it is.

486
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,083
WORF:
Captain, to the bridge.

487
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:22,208
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

488
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,083
Report.

489
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:27,834
WORF:
This energy vortex has
just appeared beneath us.

490
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,750
There was no warning.

491
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,834
Well, at least
the waiting's over.

492
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:48,750
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

493
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,166
<i>We have apparently</i>
<i>intersected with...</i>

494
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,375
<i>something.</i>

495
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,583
It is similar to our
tractor beam, sir,

496
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:57,834
only much more powerful.

497
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,625
Bridge,
this is Lieutenant La Forge.

498
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:01,917
Bridge.

499
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:03,458
The pull on the<i> Enterprise</i>
is steady.

500
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,792
I'm having to hold
the warp engines at 30%

501
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:08,125
in order to maintain
our present position.

502
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,583
Transfer engineering control
to the bridge.

503
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:11,917
On my way, Captain.

504
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:14,917
Captain, there is
a consciousness here.

505
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:16,083
Not thought--

506
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:17,959
more like instinct.

507
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,959
What do you think,
Number One?

508
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,291
I think we're being probed.

509
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:25,041
The beam is coming
from the center of the vortex.

510
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,458
Sensors show it to be

511
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:29,291
only a mass
of energy.

512
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,583
What is it trying to learn?

513
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,792
I think it's trying
to determine

514
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,959
if we are a life-force.

515
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,542
We'll stay and investigate.

516
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,125
RIKER:
Agreed.

517
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:45,625
Unless that was the mistake.

518
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,583
Staying too long.

519
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,750
Possibly.

520
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,542
We should go now.

521
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:56,750
Well...

522
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,500
That would be
the prudent move.

523
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,792
I never thought I'd hear myself
saying something like that.

524
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:07,083
Under the circumstances, sir,
I think you're right.

525
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:11,000
But you would rather stay
and find out what it is?

526
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,208
What is its intent?

527
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,959
(<i> door opens</i> )

528
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:17,375
Engineering, transfer to bridge.

529
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,458
Mr. La Forge.

530
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:19,750
Sir?

531
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,083
Try and take us out of here,
maximum warp.

532
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,917
Aye, sir.

533
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:26,917
I've set the velocity
at warp nine.

534
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:29,000
Engage.

535
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,542
Warp engines are at 91%.

536
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:41,125
Put it to the wall,
Mr. La Forge.

537
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:42,375
Aye, sir.

538
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:55,917
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

539
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,875
I can't hold it.

540
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:01,875
Captain, the engines
can't handle the strain.

541
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,208
All stop.

542
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,709
PICARD:
Mr. La Forge!

543
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:16,125
I'm re-engaging
warp engines, Captain.

544
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,125
Status?

545
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,959
All decks have reported.

546
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:26,917
No damage, no injuries.

547
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:29,041
Captain, the hold
on the<i> Enterprise</i>

548
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,875
is still very strong.

549
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:33,875
I'm having to hold at warp seven
just to maintain our position.

550
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,750
Everything we do
tightens its grip.

551
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,959
Let's see what
we can learn.

552
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:40,709
Launch a class-1 probe.

553
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:41,917
Aye, sir.

554
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:51,125
Mr. Worf...

555
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:03,125
That was personal.

556
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,375
Captain, the power drain needed

557
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:05,959
to hold this position
is enormous.

558
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,917
How long can you maintain it?

559
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:09,458
Just a few minutes

560
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,959
and then we're going
to have to shut down again.

561
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:13,333
PULASKI:
Captain, some kind of energy

562
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,917
just surrounded my patient.

563
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:16,000
Is he alive?

564
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,125
Yes.

565
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,000
Arm the photons,
Mr. Worf.

566
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,875
Lock on the center
of the vortex.

567
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:23,000
Photon torpedoes locked
on target.

568
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,250
Hold for my order.

569
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:35,750
Like a rag
in a dog's mouth.

570
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,917
I am now at maximum warp.

571
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:39,500
It's you, Captain.

572
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
It<i> was</i> the entire ship,

573
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,000
but now it has focused
its attention

574
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,041
entirely on you.

575
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,917
Captain,
I can't hold it any longer.

576
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:50,375
If we don't shut down
right now, we are going...

577
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,625
Hold this position.

578
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:55,917
Counselor, if I were
to leave the<i> Enterprise,</i>

579
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:59,917
would its attention
still be focused on me?

580
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:01,959
Yes, I think it would.

581
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,834
You'd never survive.

582
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:06,709
But in those
few seconds,

583
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:09,667
the<i> Enterprise</i>
might break free.

584
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,667
That's what he...

585
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:17,500
that's what the other Picard
must have thought.

586
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,875
Captain, where are you going?

587
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,250
You have the bridge, Number One.

588
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,792
You're leaving
the ship?

589
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:28,208
We may be on a road
that has no turns.

590
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,917
He's very
agitated.

591
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:58,166
I must get to the shuttle.

592
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:01,625
I know.

593
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,417
Do you know where you are?

594
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:08,000
The<i> Enterprise.</i>

595
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,375
Yes, but you're
only vaguely aware of it.

596
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:13,583
And me...

597
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:15,291
do you know who I am?

598
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,792
No, you don't, do you?

599
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,959
I must go.

600
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:28,291
Release him.

601
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,917
Do you know what you're doing?

602
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,709
No. Release him.

603
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,291
Security to Sick Bay.

604
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:36,625
PICARD:
No!

605
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,625
Security, disregard that order.

606
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,125
And clear all personnel--

607
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:43,500
repeat--<i> all</i> personnel
from Shuttle Bay 2.

608
00:37:57,834 --> 00:38:00,917
I don't want
any distractions.

609
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,583
You, stay here.

610
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,041
You've made a decision
to leave the ship?

611
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:10,250
I must.
Why?

612
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,834
The energy in the vortex
wants me.

613
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,000
You're certain?

614
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,208
Yes-- it's an entity.

615
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,542
A life-form
which recognizes

616
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:18,333
the<i> Enterprise</i>
as an entity

617
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:19,667
with me
as its brain.

618
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:20,959
And it wants me.

619
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,417
Shuttle Bay 2.

620
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:30,667
What's your
other option?

621
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:33,458
This is our only chance.

622
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:37,333
If I leave, it may be
distracted long enough

623
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,583
for the<i> Enterprise</i>
to escape.

624
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:40,750
You're wrong.

625
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,959
If you leave,

626
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:44,125
the<i> Enterprise</i>
will be destroyed.

627
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:45,583
Don't you remember?

628
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,375
You saw it happen.

629
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,500
If I don't
leave the ship,

630
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,542
then the<i> Enterprise</i>
will be destroyed.

631
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,959
If that's true,
then help me.

632
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,333
We want the same thing.

633
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,959
We both want the<i> Enterprise</i>
to be safe,

634
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:02,125
but there is a piece
of information
I don't have.

635
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:03,166
What is it?

636
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,583
It's me.
You?

637
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:06,291
RIKER:
Captain?

638
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,375
Yes?

639
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:08,417
We're about to lose warp drive.

640
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:09,709
Understood.
Understood.

641
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,917
When you say it wants you,

642
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:17,917
do you mean it's<i> still</i> you--
only you and it's not me?

643
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,542
You're confusing me.

644
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:21,542
We're almost
out of time.

645
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:23,333
I must get
to the shuttle.

646
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,583
Wait.

647
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:25,625
You can.

648
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:27,333
I'll let you.

649
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,625
But first, tell me,

650
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:29,709
what is...

651
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:31,250
what was your other choice?

652
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,583
Stand aside.

653
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,000
You must tell me.

654
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,333
What was it?

655
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:54,417
You don't know
what I'm talking about.

656
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:56,667
You're locked
into a single intent

657
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,208
unable to change,

658
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:02,083
unable to alter any
of your previous actions.

659
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,291
I have to leave.
There's no other way.

660
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,000
There must be.

661
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,333
One, but it would never work.

662
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:12,041
What is it?
What would never work?

663
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:14,583
I have to leave.

664
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,291
What was
the other choice?

665
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,500
We can't fight, we can't escape,
we can't go forward.

666
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,041
No, no, we can't go forward.

667
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,083
That would destroy
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

668
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,500
Was that it?

669
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,458
Was that the other choice?

670
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,333
I must leave.

671
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,583
No.

672
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:36,083
Captain Picard!

673
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,750
I cannot allow you to leave.

674
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,375
Before we can go forward,

675
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:46,083
the cycle must end.

676
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:07,834
Dr. Pulaski,
report to Shuttle Bay 2.

677
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,875
Bridge.

678
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,250
Number One, we're wasting
our energy trying to escape.

679
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,834
It only weakens us.

680
00:41:54,834 --> 00:41:57,125
Helm, set a course
for the center of the vortex.

681
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,417
Mr. La Forge, on my command,

682
00:41:58,417 --> 00:41:59,875
I want all the power
you can muster.

683
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:01,000
Yes, sir.

684
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,041
Are we going in?

685
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:03,500
Yes.

686
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,125
DATA:
Course set, sir.

687
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:08,250
Now, everyone
hold their position.

688
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,625
No matter what.

689
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,041
Engage.

690
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,166
O'BRIEN:
Captain Picard.

691
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:54,709
This is Shuttle Bay 2.

692
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:57,208
The other Picard
and the shuttle are gone.

693
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,792
Explain.

694
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:00,750
They just vanished.

695
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:05,041
What's our position?

696
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:08,291
We are back on course
to Endicor.

697
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:12,166
RIKER:
Stand down
from Red Alert.

698
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:14,458
All decks have reported in.

699
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,458
No damage, no casualties.

700
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:23,458
You have the bridge,
Number One.

701
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:33,458
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

702
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,125
A lot of questions,
Number One.

703
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:53,083
Damn few answers.

704
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:55,375
Maybe none of it was real.

705
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:59,250
Perhaps we were all part
of a shared illusion.

706
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:04,375
Or maybe he was
thrown back in time

707
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:07,458
so that we would be able
to take another road--

708
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:08,667
make...

709
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:11,083
make a different choice.

710
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,542
Well, they say
if you travel far enough,

711
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:18,166
you will eventually
meet yourself.

712
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:20,583
Having experienced that,
Number One,

713
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:24,166
it's not something
I would care to repeat.

714
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:27,125
I'll be on the bridge, sir.
