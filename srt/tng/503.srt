1
00:00:01,625 --> 00:00:03,291
There's a time when you want
to call a Romulan's bluff

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:06,166
and there's a time when
you don't, wouldn't you say?

3
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:08,959
Well, one does not
always have the luxury.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,041
You've got to choose
your time and place with them.

5
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,917
True or false?

6
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:16,750
Yes, whenever possible.

7
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:19,750
So, this time
you were lucky.

8
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,375
Hmm.

9
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,208
Ah, I suppose...

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,125
all's well
that ends well.

11
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,417
But if I'd been
in your shoes...

12
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:27,750
Well, you know,
that...

13
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:29,458
really does look
very nice, Mr. Mot.

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,583
I think that will
be sufficient.

15
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,667
Ahh, hold on.

16
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:36,000
Hmm...

17
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:39,041
There.

18
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,709
You know, I must
tell you, Captain,

19
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,542
Will Riker was in
for a trim yesterday,

20
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,542
and he agrees with me
a hundred percent.

21
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,500
RIKER:
Bridge to Captain Picard.

22
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:49,792
Yes?
Sorry to interrupt.

23
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,542
We're receiving
an emergency distress signal

24
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,166
from the Solarion Four
colony.

25
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,250
Uh-oh, that's right along
the Cardassian border.

26
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,750
Lay in a new course.

27
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,667
I'm on my way.

28
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,250
I told him we shouldn't
have colonized

29
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,458
so close
to the Cardassians.

30
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,625
Report.

31
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:12,583
The signal ended
abruptly at 0455.

32
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,709
Unable to raise them
on subspace.

33
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,166
Hail them on the upper and lower
band frequencies, Mr. Worf.

34
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,542
I've tried.
No response.

35
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,083
Time to the Solarion
system?

36
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,959
26 minutes,
Captain.

37
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:27,750
I understand you've been
discussing alternative

38
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:31,125
adversarial engagement
strategies with Mot.

39
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,208
It would be more
accurate to say

40
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,750
he was discussing them
with me.

41
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,625
He's the best barber
in Starfleet.

42
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:36,667
What can you do?

43
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,667
Sir, receiving
another signal

44
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:41,959
of a vessel leaving orbit
of Solarion Four.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,667
New frequency,
low band, audio only.

46
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,542
Open a channel.

47
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,333
MAN:
This is the Bajora.

48
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,291
We claim responsibility
for the destruction

49
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,208
of the Federation
colony on Solarion Four.

50
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,750
As long as we are
without our homeland,

51
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:03,291
no one will be safe
in this sector.

52
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:37,917
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

53
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,125
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

54
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,834
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

55
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:47,458
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

56
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,959
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,375
<i>to boldly go where no one</i>
<i>has gone before.</i>

58
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:57,125
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45076.3.</i>

59
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,000
<i>We have arrived</i>
<i>at Lya Station Alpha</i>

60
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,333
<i>with survivors from</i>
<i>Solarion Four.</i>

61
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,500
<i>Admiral Kennelly has</i>
<i>rendezvoused</i>

62
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:07,250
<i>to discuss the Bajoran</i>
<i>terrorist attack.</i>

63
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,792
(<i> coughing</i> )

64
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,750
Sorry.

65
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:16,750
Ginger tea with honey,
80 degrees Celsius.

66
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,709
Ginger tea?

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,083
My Aunt Adele's cure
for the common cold.

68
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,000
Common, hell...

69
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,125
I picked this up from
the Cardassian liaison

70
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,291
this weekend.

71
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,333
It's some damn virus
they've sicced on me.

72
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,959
Did he have anything
to say about this attack?

73
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:41,583
It's the same old story
for the Cardassians.

74
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,959
They've had
terrorist problems

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,917
ever since they annexed
the Bajoran home world

76
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,208
40 years ago.

77
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,875
But in 40 years,
they've never attacked

78
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:51,834
a Federation target.

79
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,333
A new militant
splinter group

80
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,625
has broken away from
the Bajoran settlement camps.

81
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,041
Leader's name is Orta.

82
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,458
Apparently, he's willing
to do whatever he has to

83
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,375
to get attention.

84
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:05,000
And our response?

85
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,000
Listen, Jean-Luc.

86
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:11,875
I'm the first to say
the Bajora deserve attention.

87
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:14,959
Chased off their own planet
by the Cardassians,

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,709
forced to wander
the galaxy,

89
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,583
settling wherever
they can find room.

90
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,625
It's tragic.

91
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:20,917
On many worlds
we've been to,

92
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,250
they are isolated,
treated as pariahs.

93
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,250
The Federation is
sympathetic to their cause,

94
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,750
but they're not
helping themselves

95
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:29,625
with an attack
like this.

96
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,750
That's what I want you
to communicate to them.

97
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:34,166
But this could be
done through

98
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,792
diplomatic channels,
Admiral.

99
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:39,709
What do you really
want of us?

100
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,041
Find this
terrorist leader Orta.

101
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,333
Get him back
where he belongs

102
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,875
any way you can.

103
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:48,625
Any way I can?

104
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,542
The Federation has dozens
of settlements in that sector.

105
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,250
We cannot allow
the violence to continue.

106
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,000
And what do I have
to offer Orta

107
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,834
to might persuade him
to cooperate?

108
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,583
Amnesty.

109
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:01,917
Admiral...

110
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,458
(laughing)

111
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,208
And a promise
that we will

112
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,208
immediately begin
to address this issue

113
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,792
with the Cardassians.

114
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:12,333
Quietly,
behind the scenes,

115
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:16,000
using every legitimate
means possible.

116
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,041
But the Bajora
must be patient.

117
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,542
Admiral,
they've endured

118
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,125
generations of
sympathy and promises.

119
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,333
How can I believe
that this Orta

120
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,208
will be satisfied
with more of the same?

121
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,333
It's your job to see to it
that he does, Jean-Luc.

122
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,917
RIKER:
Riker to Captain Picard.

123
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,083
Go ahead.

124
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,417
Have you approved
the transfer

125
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,750
of a new officer
to the<i> Enterprise?</i>

126
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:40,667
PICARD:
Negative.

127
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, we've got one
waiting to beam aboard

128
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,125
complete with orders.

129
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,583
RIKER:
Ensign Ro Laren.

130
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:50,000
Ro Laren?
From the<i> Wellington?</i>

131
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,166
RIKER:
The very same.

132
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,250
Shall I tell her there's
been some mistake?

133
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,208
Stand by, Commander.

134
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,041
I wrote the orders.

135
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,166
I thought she might be
valuable to you.

136
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,750
Admiral,
respectfully,

137
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,583
I would appreciate
consulting rights

138
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,083
on the assigning
of a new officer,

139
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,917
especially one with
the record of Ro Laren.

140
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,625
She's Bajoran.

141
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:14,250
There are other Bajorans in
Starfleet, assign one of them.

142
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,709
I've discussed
this situation with her.

143
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,834
And I am convinced that she is
the right one for this job.

144
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,458
After what happened
on Garon Two,

145
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,667
she has no business
serving on any starship--

146
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,250
let alone the flagship,
my ship!

147
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,917
You're taking her,
Captain.

148
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,667
It's been arranged.

149
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,875
I can't tell you
how difficult it was

150
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:37,667
to get her
out of prison.

151
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,959
It's that
important to you?

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,166
It's that important
to the mission.

153
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,667
Picard to Riker.

154
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:49,709
RIKER:
Go ahead.

155
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,125
Proceed with
the transport.

156
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,583
Sir..?
I'll fill you in later.

157
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,500
Yes, sir.

158
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,792
I hope you and I don't
regret this, Admiral.

159
00:07:57,834 --> 00:08:00,208
You can handle her,
Captain,

160
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,792
if anyone can.

161
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,291
Ensign Ro Laren reporting
as ordered, Commander.

162
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,750
You will follow
Starfleet uniform code

163
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,750
aboard this ship,
Ensign.

164
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,875
There will be members
of this crew who will

165
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,750
not want to serve
with Ensign Laren, sir.

166
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:57,000
They will have to learn
to live with it.

167
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,375
I intend to demand the highest
level of performance from her.

168
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,792
I would expect
nothing less.

169
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,500
It won't be
for long, will.

170
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,542
(<i> door chimes</i> )

171
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,083
Come.

172
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,250
Yes, Ensign Laren,
please sit down.

173
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,625
Ensign Ro, sir.

174
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,041
I beg your pardon?

175
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,208
The Bajoran custom has
the family name first,

176
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,667
the individual's
name second.

177
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,083
I am properly
addressed as Ensign Ro.

178
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,125
I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

179
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,166
No, there's
no reason you should.

180
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,709
It's an old custom.

181
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,792
Most Bajora these days
accept the distortion

182
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,250
of their names
in order to assimilate.

183
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,417
I do not.

184
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,333
I wish to be candid
with you, Ensign.

185
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,625
Please.

186
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:44,500
I'm fully aware of
your Starfleet record

187
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,959
your problems
on other ships,

188
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,709
and the incident
on Garon Two

189
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,667
that led to your
court-martial.

190
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,667
And I'm concerned
about your presence

191
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,041
on this
delicate mission.

192
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,417
I don't want to be here

193
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,709
any more than you
want me to be here,<i> sir.</i>

194
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,959
Then why did you take
this assignment?

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,166
If I may be
equally candid?

196
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,750
It's better than prison.

197
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:09,417
RIKER:
Better than prison?

198
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,083
There are officers who wait
years to serve on this ship.

199
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,750
Being called back
into Starfleet

200
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:16,166
was not my idea.
Nor ours.

201
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,375
Nevertheless, we will
all be serving together.

202
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,750
Commander Riker and I
have expectations....

203
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:25,375
Captain,
I know the routine.

204
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,417
You don't have
to worry about me.

205
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,333
We're stuck with
each other.

206
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,875
So let's just get this
over with as quickly as possible

207
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,875
and go our own
separate ways, okay?

208
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,750
Dismissed.

209
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,583
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

210
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,458
<i>We are approaching</i>
<i>the Valo system on</i>

211
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,291
<i>the outskirts</i>
<i>of Cardassian territory</i>

212
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,542
<i>where many Bajorans</i>
<i>have resettled.</i>

213
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,041
There are dozens
of Bajoran camps

214
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,166
on the three
class M planets.

215
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,417
I suggest we start
on Valo Three

216
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:04,542
where an ad hoc leader
named Jas Holza lives.

217
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,542
The Federation has had
several dealings with him.

218
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,250
I met Holza
at a symposium

219
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,500
a few years ago.

220
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:11,333
What can you tell us
about him, Doctor?

221
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,959
I found him to be
a very concerned leader

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,291
and a good spokesman
for his people

223
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,208
and a terrific dancer.

224
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,959
No, really,
I'm serious.

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
At a... reception
afterwards.

226
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,500
At least this man has
genuine experience in diplomacy.

227
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,500
And that's a big advantage
on this mission.

228
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:29,834
Very well, Mr. Data.

229
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,417
Will you contact Holza
and arrange a meeting?

230
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,750
Sir.

231
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,083
Ensign Ro?

232
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,417
You're familiar
with the star system.

233
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,875
You'll take the conn.

234
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,375
Is there a problem,
Ensign?

235
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,750
You're wasting
your time.

236
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:47,000
Holza is nobody.

237
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,792
He's the token Bajoran that
respectable people

238
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,125
invite to symposiums
and diplomatic soirees,

239
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,041
but he has no real influence
among my people.

240
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,917
Ensign, whom do you
suggest we speak to?

241
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,500
Don't you understand?

242
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,000
These are
desperate people

243
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,083
ready to martyr
themselves.

244
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,542
They don't want to talk.

245
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,083
Well, this ship
is prepared

246
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,709
to defend itself
if necessary.

247
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,166
Oh, it will be.
Don't fool yourself.

248
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,458
This mission will end
in bloodshed.

249
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,458
Well, let's hope that
you're mistaken, Ensign.

250
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,291
But can you point us at
the right individual,

251
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,750
as Mr. Data suggested?

252
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,750
I would go to the camp

253
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,709
on the southern continent
of Valo Two.

254
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,750
Find a man
named Keeve Falor.

255
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,417
He has no diplomatic
experience,

256
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,959
and he won't
ask you to dance.

257
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,834
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

258
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,458
<i>I read about</i>
<i>the achievements</i>

259
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,834
<i>of the ancient Bajoran</i>
<i>civilization</i>

260
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,583
<i>in my fifth grade reader.</i>

261
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,166
<i>They were architects</i>
<i>and artists,</i>

262
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,709
<i>builders</i>
<i>and philosophers</i>

263
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,083
<i>when humans were not yet</i>
<i>standing erect.</i>

264
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,625
<i>Now I see how history</i>
<i>has rewarded them.</i>

265
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,291
This used to be me.

266
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,125
<i>Baleekam.</i>
<i>Baleek, baleek!</i>

267
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,834
<i>Baleekam.</i>
<i>Baleek!</i>

268
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,500
<i>Baleek!</i>

269
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,834
Ro Laren.

270
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,417
It's been a long time.

271
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,792
Keeve Falor,

272
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,208
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

273
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,959
Commander Data,
and Lieutenant Worf.

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,458
I'm pleased
you agreed

275
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,250
to meet with us,
Mr. Keeve.

276
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,959
You honor me by the proper
use of my name, Captain.

277
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,041
Ensign Ro has
educated me.

278
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:50,000
Has she? I'm pleased
you still remember.

279
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,458
Let me show you
our camp.

280
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,500
We are not
a violent race, Captain.

281
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,834
Just passionate about
our cause,

282
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,750
and that passion has
led some to take up arms.

283
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,041
Do you know
where we can find Orta?

284
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,125
I'm afraid not.

285
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,291
Can you help us
to locate him?

286
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,959
I'm sorry,
I don't wish to help you.

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,667
Don't misunderstand.

288
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:17,250
I for one believe the raid
on the Federation outpost

289
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,917
was poor judgment.

290
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,667
You are innocent
bystanders,

291
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,333
and I cannot
condone violence

292
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,500
against those who are
not our enemies.

293
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,875
Then, I don't understand
why you're unwilling.

294
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:29,750
Because you are
innocent bystanders.

295
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:31,500
You were innocent
bystanders for decades

296
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,667
as the Cardassians
took our homes--

297
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,500
as they violated
and tortured our people

298
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,709
in the most hideous
ways imaginable.

299
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,417
As we were
forced to flee.

300
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,208
We were saddened
by those events,

301
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,792
but they occurred

302
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:45,500
within the designated borders
of the Cardassian Empire.

303
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:48,500
And the Federation is
pledged not to interfere

304
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:50,917
in the internal
affairs of others.

305
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,375
How convenient
that must be for you.

306
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:56,041
To turn a deaf ear
to those who suffer

307
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,750
behind a line
on a map.

308
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:00,792
Well, I'm not here to debate
Federation policy with you,

309
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,792
but I<i> can</i> offer you
assistance.

310
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:06,834
Simply because of
one terrorist attack?

311
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,458
Well, perhaps I should
have known, then.

312
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,208
We should have attacked
the Federation long ago.

313
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,834
What do you think
of that, Ro?

314
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,250
I think you are
a small man who feels

315
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,500
a rush of power
in his belly

316
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,208
and enjoys it
far too much, Keeve.

317
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,875
Stop talking
and listen.

318
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:25,500
We've had our problems
with the Cardassians, too.

319
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,834
But now that
we have a treaty,

320
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,333
we're in a position
to help.

321
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,625
Your people
have been forced

322
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:34,375
to resettle
all over the quadrant,

323
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,125
but now we can make

324
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,333
a legitimate case
with the Cardassians

325
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,041
that this is not
an isolated problem.

326
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,709
We can work
diplomatically

327
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,000
on your behalf.

328
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:47,250
But first these
terrorist attacks must end.

329
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,083
We live in different
universes, you and I.

330
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:54,083
Yours is about diplomacy,
politics, strategy.

331
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,667
Mine is about blankets.

332
00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:00,041
If we were to exchange
places for one night,

333
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,917
you might better
understand.

334
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,375
Mr. Data, see that
the replicators

335
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,166
provide a blanket for
every man, woman and child

336
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,250
before nightfall.
Aye, sir.

337
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,959
Mr. Worf, determine what
these people may have

338
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,667
in the way
of emergency needs.

339
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:15,667
And provide for them.

340
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,500
WORF:
Yes, sir.

341
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,750
Thank you.

342
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:21,667
Return to your ship.

343
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:24,000
I will contact you when
I have any information

344
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,834
that might be
of assistance to you.

345
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,333
Ensign.

346
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,542
You were helpful.

347
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,750
The blankets were helpful.

348
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,542
Nothing I said
mattered.

349
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,875
In an age when
their technology

350
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:48,500
should be able to clothe
and feed all of them...

351
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:51,125
that they should
live like this.

352
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,959
I couldn't,
and I wouldn't.

353
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,250
That's one reason
I ran away.

354
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,458
They're lost,
defeated.

355
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,750
I will never be.

356
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,875
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45077.8.</i>

357
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,792
<i>Keeve Falor has kept</i>
<i>his promise</i>

358
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:24,750
<i>and directed us towards</i>
<i>the third moon of Valo One</i>

359
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,166
<i>where we will meet tomorrow</i>

360
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,750
<i>with the terrorist</i>
<i>leader, Orta.</i>

361
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,834
Do you mind
if we join you?

362
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,375
Yes.

363
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:52,291
I'll tell you one thing,
if I ever find myself

364
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,625
on an away team
with Ensign Ro,

365
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,667
I won't
turn my back on her.

366
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:56,834
Perhaps the Captain felt

367
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,500
she'd be valuable
on the mission.

368
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,667
That was orders.
Had to be.

369
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:02,333
She doesn't
belong here.

370
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,709
She doesn't even
belong in the uniform

371
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,291
as far as
I'm concerned.

372
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,417
Really?

373
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,792
Really.

374
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:09,625
Sounds like someone
I'd like to know.

375
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,834
Excuse me.

376
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,250
Am I disturbing you?

377
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,625
Yes.

378
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,208
Good.

379
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,291
You look like someone
who wants to be disturbed.

380
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,792
I'd rather be alone.

381
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:26,959
Oh, no, you wouldn't.

382
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,166
I beg your pardon.

383
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,500
Well, if you wanted
to be alone,

384
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,000
you would have stayed
in your quarters.

385
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,375
The only reason to come here
is to be amongst people.

386
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:35,875
Who are you?

387
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,667
My name is Guinan.

388
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:40,375
I tend bar,
and I listen.

389
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:41,792
Huh.

390
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,667
Have you heard
anything interesting?

391
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:46,250
Everyone's
talking about you.

392
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,417
Heard anything
interesting?

393
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,750
Mm-hmm.

394
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:55,250
Well, it's all true.

395
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,834
I believe truth is in
the eye of the beholder.

396
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,333
Isn't that supposed
to be beauty?

397
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,709
Truth, beauty-- it works
for a lot of things.

398
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,834
They say you never told
the true story of Galon Two.

399
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,875
They also say
you didn't defend yourself

400
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,458
at your court-martial.

401
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,792
What was to defend?

402
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:19,583
I didn't follow orders.

403
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,375
Eight members
of the away team died.

404
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:23,625
Your fault?

405
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,917
Yeah, my fault.

406
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,500
So you sit alone
in crowded rooms

407
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,625
staring at your drink.

408
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:36,500
I think you enjoy it.

409
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,750
I enjoy it?

410
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:42,834
Well, you work so hard
at torturing yourself.

411
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,125
I can only think
you must enjoy it.

412
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,458
Who are you?

413
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,208
I told you,
I'm Guinan.

414
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,875
I tend bar,
and I listen.

415
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:55,375
Well, you're not like any
bartender I ever met before.

416
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,542
And you're not like
any Starfleet officer

417
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,375
I've ever met before,

418
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,792
but that sounds
like the beginning

419
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:04,291
of a very interesting
friendship.

420
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,917
I don't stay anywhere
long enough to make friends.

421
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,583
Too late.

422
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,041
You just did.

423
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,500
Excuse me.

424
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:21,959
FEMALE VOICE:
Bridge to Ensign Ro.

425
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,458
Go ahead.

426
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,458
Subspace communication
coming in for you, Ensign.

427
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,417
Thank you.

428
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:41,375
Computer, direct subspace
transmission to monitor.

429
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,208
Your report, Ensign.

430
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,917
Everything is going exactly
as you predicted, Admiral.

431
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:59,625
Any indication of weapons
or vessels beneath the surface?

432
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:02,333
The composition of the moon's
surface is blocking the sensors.

433
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,834
Which is very likely
why they chose this moon

434
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,291
for their base
of operations.

435
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,750
We're on
a timetable here.

436
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,083
Where's Ro?

437
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,750
Picard to Ensign Ro.

438
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,500
Computer,
locate ensign Ro.

439
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,166
COMPUTER:
Ensign Ro is not on board

440
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,834
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

441
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,750
Check
the transport log.

442
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,291
She beamed down almost
six hours ago, sir.

443
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,583
Any activity
at the meeting site?

444
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,375
No, sir,
they didn't show up.

445
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:30,875
What the hell is
going on?

446
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:32,834
Prepare to transport us
to the same location

447
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,709
Ensign Ro beamed to.

448
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,417
Mr. Worf, phasers.

449
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:52,709
I'm picking up molecular
displacement traces.

450
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,458
That suggests
movement in this area

451
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,834
during the last
ten hours.

452
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,542
See if we can determine
their direction.

453
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,917
Standard
search pattern.

454
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,917
Maintain tricorder
security link.

455
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:04,250
Mr. Worf,
you come with me.

456
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:29,041
Data, I'm picking up energy
fluctuations over here.

457
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,792
Troi to Picard.

458
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,458
Captain, acknowledge.

459
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,583
Data to Picard.

460
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,625
Data to Worf.

461
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,000
Hold it.

462
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:11,250
Captain Picard.

463
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,208
I am Orta.

464
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,625
Please forgive
my appearance.

465
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,959
Unfortunately,
some years ago

466
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,083
as a guest
of the Cardassians,

467
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:25,291
my face was mutilated.

468
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,875
My vocal cords
were cut.

469
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:29,792
It was not necessary
to abduct us.

470
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:31,041
I am sorry,

471
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,500
but after speaking
with Ro Laren,

472
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,834
I decided that it was.

473
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,375
Then she has done us
both a disservice.

474
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,458
I am committed to peace.

475
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,417
I am not at all
interested in peace

476
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:47,000
and I am not convinced
that you are either.

477
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,417
Captain, I did not come here
to undermine this mission.

478
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,375
Whatever your motives,
you've already done

479
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:54,208
enough to damage
these negotiations.

480
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,458
I came here to convince these
people to listen to you.

481
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,917
I didn't want this
to end in bloodshed.

482
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,291
There will be
no bloodshed.

483
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,542
You don't know
all the facts, sir.

484
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,834
Then perhaps you would
share them with me.

485
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,500
All is not what it seems
to be, captain.

486
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:11,625
Perhaps someone is
using you to get to me.

487
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:14,208
Perhaps you are a victim
of this deception as well.

488
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,625
I do not know.

489
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,250
Deception?

490
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,125
Your mission was to seek out
the Bajoran terrorists

491
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:23,417
who destroyed the Federation
settlement on Solarion Four.

492
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,667
Yes.

493
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:26,834
As I have informed
Ro Laren,

494
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,750
it was not the Bajora.

495
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,333
He admits responsibility
for dozens of attacks

496
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,000
on Cardassian targets.

497
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,041
Why should we believe him
about Solarion Four?

498
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,834
He has
no reason to lie.

499
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,333
He fears
our reprisal.

500
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,250
I perceived no fear
or deception from him.

501
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,500
If they did not attack
Solarion Four, then who did?

502
00:24:57,542 --> 00:25:00,917
And why would anyone want
to falsely implicate the Bajora?

503
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:04,000
Perhaps someone wanted
to draw us into the conflict.

504
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,500
But what would anyone
gain by doing that?

505
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:07,917
PICARD:
Ensign Ro.

506
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,792
May I see you
in my ready room?

507
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:11,709
Yes, sir.

508
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:22,083
You do not leave this ship
without authorization.

509
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,375
Captain,
I'm sorry, but...

510
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:24,875
This is not
a discussion.

511
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,375
You're restricted
to your quarters

512
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:29,375
for the remainder of
this mission, dismissed.

513
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:48,291
(<i> door chimes</i> )

514
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,125
(<i> door chimes</i> )

515
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:55,667
What?

516
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:58,375
Hello.

517
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,291
It's me, Guinan.

518
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,041
I heard
you got grounded.

519
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:05,291
I really don't feel
like talking right now.

520
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,417
Come on.
Sure you do.

521
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:10,000
Why is it every time
I tell you something,

522
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,875
you tell me I mean
the exact opposite?

523
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:13,667
Because you're
one of those people

524
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:15,667
who's got their poles
reversed.

525
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:20,417
Do you want
to talk about it?

526
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,834
It's nothing
you can help me with.

527
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,000
Well, how do you know
until you try?

528
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,208
Look, I got myself
into this.

529
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,458
I'm just trying to figure
a way out, that's all.

530
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:33,375
Without anyone
getting killed this time.

531
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:40,291
Seems like everybody's
just pulling my strings,

532
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,458
you know, like I've got
no control.

533
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,875
Hmm.

534
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,208
For people
like you and me--

535
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,417
who have lost
their homes--

536
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:58,750
sometimes that's
the way life feels.

537
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,875
I'm in trouble.

538
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,834
There's more going on here

539
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:13,125
than anybody
on this ship realizes.

540
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:16,875
It's more than I know
how to deal with,

541
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:19,875
and I really don't know
who to trust anymore.

542
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:21,917
Including yourself?

543
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:24,542
Oh, especially myself.

544
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:28,375
Hmm.

545
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:32,291
You know,
a very long time ago,

546
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,959
I got into some serious
trouble too--

547
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,542
and I mean serious--

548
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:40,834
and I'd probably
still be there

549
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:43,166
if I hadn't
trusted one man.

550
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,125
(<i> door chimes</i> )

551
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,959
Come.

552
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:55,291
Ensign Ro has some things
she'd like to talk to you about.

553
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,417
Ensign Ro has been

554
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,583
confined
to her quarters.

555
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,625
Well, she can go
back to her quarters

556
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,750
when she's done.

557
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,583
Guinan, I don't know why you
are involved in this, but...

558
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,250
She's my friend.

559
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,959
Please sit down.

560
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,709
Guinan is
very selective

561
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,000
about whom
she calls a friend.

562
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:37,917
Sir, when I finish telling you
what I have to tell you,

563
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:39,917
I'm probably gonna
end up back in the stockade

564
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,250
one way or the other,

565
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:44,750
and if that's the way
it has to be, then...

566
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:47,625
I just can't
do this anymore.

567
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,834
What can you not do
anymore, Ensign?

568
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:53,333
Admiral Kennelly
came to me in prison

569
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,041
and told me he'd arrange
to get me out

570
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,625
if I'd go
on a mission.

571
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,041
I know that part.

572
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:01,208
No, sir.
Not this mission.

573
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,417
One for him
and only him.

574
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:07,458
You were being sent
to talk, to negotiate.

575
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,291
The admiral knew
that was hopeless.

576
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,667
My job was to give Orta
an incentive.

577
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:15,959
What kind
of incentive?

578
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,959
One that
you couldn't offer.

579
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,583
One that Starfleet
couldn't offer.

580
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,250
Orta was to end the terrorism
against the Federation

581
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:25,333
and return with
his people to the camps.

582
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:27,667
In exchange,

583
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:30,333
he would get
weapons, ships.

584
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,208
Things that would
really make a difference

585
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,959
against the Cardassians
in the future.

586
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,709
I find that
impossible to believe.

587
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,458
That Admiral Kennelly
would consider

588
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,750
supplying weapons
to the terrorists.

589
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:44,250
If you ask him,
he'll deny it.

590
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,834
But it's true.

591
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:48,000
I didn't leave the ship without
authorization, Captain.

592
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,250
I received it from
the admiral last night.

593
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,333
You have been in contact
with Admiral Kennelly

594
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,583
during this mission?

595
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,208
Yes, sir.

596
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,792
The subspace log can confirm

597
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:00,333
that part of it,
at least.

598
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,875
Arming these people
is a violation

599
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:18,750
of everything that
the Federation stands for.

600
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:21,083
Even you cannot
be blind to that.

601
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,166
No, sir, I'm not.

602
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,834
but this was something
I had to do.

603
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:29,083
You see, Captain,

604
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,709
when I was
seven years old,

605
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,500
I was given a piece
of sugar candy.

606
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,834
And I was led
by a Cardassian

607
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:40,417
into a room where
my father was sitting.

608
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,792
And he looked at me
with eyes I'd never seen.

609
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,250
The Cardassian began
to ask him questions.

610
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:56,083
And during
the next two hours,

611
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,709
as I was forced
to watch...

612
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:05,375
my father was tortured
until he died.

613
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,834
And I remember
feeling...

614
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:14,041
so ashamed of him
as he begged for mercy.

615
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,458
I was ashamed of him
for being weak.

616
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,583
I was ashamed
of being Bajoran.

617
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,959
Later I began
to understand

618
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,834
how misguided
those feelings were,

619
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,959
and...

620
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,041
and yet somehow they have
remained a part of me.

621
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,959
I don't want to be ashamed of
my heritage any longer, Captain.

622
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:45,375
I serve the Federation,

623
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:48,125
but I am Bajoran.

624
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:49,959
A Starfleet admiral
presented me

625
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,291
with an opportunity to help
my people in their fight

626
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:55,417
against
the Cardassians.

627
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,500
I had to accept.

628
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,917
Have you made
this offer to Orta?

629
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:06,417
No.

630
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:10,041
After he told me the Bajora
hadn't attacked Solarion Four,

631
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,250
nothing made sense anymore--
I decided to wait

632
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:13,792
until I could figure out
what was going on.

633
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:15,458
That was a wise
choice, Ensign.

634
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,083
It probably saved you
from another court-martial.

635
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,083
Have you briefed
Admiral Kennelly

636
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,792
since we returned
from the surface?

637
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:26,291
No, sir.

638
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,291
Captain, I don't know
who to trust anymore.

639
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,667
But that strange
bartender of yours

640
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:33,917
has a way of getting
to you, and...

641
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,667
and she said that
you were her friend.

642
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:39,250
Then we have
one thing in common.

643
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:45,125
Do you think that Orta
would cooperate with us

644
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:47,417
to determine
the truth here?

645
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:50,834
I think I can
persuade him to.

646
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:52,875
Good.

647
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,125
Our orders were
to find him,

648
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,417
to bring him
back to the camps

649
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,375
any way we could.

650
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:59,875
Perhaps that's exactly
what we should do.

651
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:02,250
And then what?

652
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,583
And then watch
what happens.

653
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,250
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

654
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,792
<i>I have become</i>
<i>convinced that</i>

655
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:20,250
<i>we are somehow involved</i>
<i>in a conspiracy.</i>

656
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,000
<i>I'm hopeful</i>
<i>the purpose behind it</i>

657
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,000
<i>will be revealed</i>
<i>in the next few hours.</i>

658
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:26,709
Well done,
Captain.

659
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,333
It was a team effort,
Admiral.

660
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:30,041
Ensign Ro was
invaluable.

661
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,291
Good.

662
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,583
What's the next step?

663
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,375
The<i> Enterprise</i> will
escort a Bajoran

664
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:35,625
Antares-class cruiser

665
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:37,625
to the Valo Three camp
at 0500 hours.

666
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,667
Orta and his people
will be on board.

667
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:42,166
Good. Keep us advised
of your progress.

668
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:43,583
Acknowledged.

669
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:47,041
How's that Cardassian
virus, Admiral?

670
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:49,125
A lot better.
Thank you.

671
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:50,875
I'm pleased.

672
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:52,917
We'll report as soon as
our mission is accomplished.

673
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:54,458
Picard out.

674
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,709
RIKER:
Ensign Ro, take us

675
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,125
to the designated
coordinates.

676
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:58,667
Aye, sir.
Mr. Data,

677
00:33:58,709 --> 00:34:00,333
keep an eye
on the Cardassian border.

678
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:01,959
Aye, sir.

679
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:14,542
The Bajoran vessel is moving up
from the surface, Captain.

680
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,583
On screen.

681
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:23,166
Hail them, Mr. Worf.

682
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,750
Audio channel open.

683
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:27,166
The ship does not have
visual capabilities.

684
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,125
This is Captain Picard.

685
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,291
We are prepared to escort you
to Valo Three.

686
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:33,291
BAJORAN WOMAN:
Acknowledged, Captain.

687
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:36,458
Be advised that our ship is
limited to half impulse.

688
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,583
Ensign Ro, set a course for
Valo Three, half impulse.

689
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,041
Aye, sir.

690
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:52,417
I am monitoring
increased activity

691
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:54,500
inside Cardassian space.

692
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:56,208
Two ships moving
along the border

693
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,959
heading 142.051.

694
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,875
Can you identify the class
of those ships, Mr. Worf?

695
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:05,625
Cardassian warships,
Galor class, Type-3.

696
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,458
Top of the line.

697
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,458
They are moving into a course
parallel to our own, Captain.

698
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,792
Yellow alert.

699
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:13,834
Continue
to monitor them.

700
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,792
Ensign Ro,
what's the closest we come

701
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:17,583
to the Cardassian border
at our current heading

702
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:18,583
to Valo Three?

703
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:20,917
13,400 kilometers, sir.

704
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:22,166
RIKER:
E.T.A.?

705
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,542
RO:
Eight minutes.

706
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:27,125
That's where
it will be.

707
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,500
The Cardassian ships are
changing course, sir.

708
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:36,166
They are crossing
the border.

709
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:39,083
They're increasing power
to their forward weapons grid.

710
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,417
Red alert.

711
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:41,875
Ensign Ro,
set a course

712
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:43,250
to intercept
the Cardassians.

713
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,917
Mr. Worf, open a channel
to the Bajoran vessel.

714
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:47,750
Open.

715
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,333
This is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

716
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,625
We are moving to intercept
two Cardassian warships.

717
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,417
Maintain your present
course and speed.

718
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:55,625
BAJORAN:
Acknowledged,<i> Enterprise.</i>

719
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,959
The Cardassians are
within visual range.

720
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,417
On screen.

721
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,709
WORF:
They are hailing us, sir.

722
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,959
Open a channel,
Mr. Worf.

723
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,291
This is Captain
Jean-Luc Picard

724
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,375
of the Federation
Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

725
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:12,709
How can we help you?

726
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,500
<i>Gul Dolak,</i>
Cardassian militia four one.

727
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:18,291
We have no argument
with you, Captain.

728
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:20,917
I'm pleased to hear
that, Gul Dolak.

729
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,709
All of us
in the Federation

730
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,166
value our peaceful relations
with our Cardassian neighbors.

731
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,041
No more than
we value the relations

732
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,750
with our Federation
neighbors.

733
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,208
Well, now that

734
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,792
we've established
our mutual goodwill,

735
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:35,291
what's on your mind?

736
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,166
We have identified
the Bajoran ship

737
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,834
you are escorting
as a terrorist carrier.

738
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:43,166
Terrorist carrier?
Are you certain?

739
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,709
Most certain, Captain.

740
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,458
It has committed
many crimes against us.

741
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,542
We know
its markings well.

742
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,458
Well, rest assured,
Gul Dolak,

743
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,166
there will be
no terrorist attacks today.

744
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:54,917
We are escorting
the Bajoran settlers

745
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:56,792
to their camp on
Valo Three.

746
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:59,333
You can monitor
their course if you wish.

747
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:02,125
We would request that
you withdraw

748
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,792
and leave
the matter to us.

749
00:37:04,917 --> 00:37:07,667
This is neutral space,
Gul Dolak.

750
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:09,709
You have
no jurisdiction here.

751
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,709
Nor do you.

752
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:14,166
If we withdraw,

753
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:16,667
what do you intend to do
with the Bajoran vessel?

754
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:19,000
We intend
to destroy it.

755
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:21,959
I see.

756
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,750
That puts me in
a difficult position.

757
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:25,875
I've promised to escort
these people to their camps.

758
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:29,000
You are protecting the enemies
of the Cardassian people.

759
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,875
If you do not withdraw,
we will take great offense.

760
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,875
I'm sorry to offend you,
Gul Dolak,

761
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:37,250
but we cannot
withdraw.

762
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:40,375
We are prepared to take
any steps necessary.

763
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,709
Is that intended
as a threat?

764
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:46,709
It is a complaint...

765
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,750
from your Cardassian
neighbors.

766
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:52,709
You have
one hour to withdraw.

767
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,834
Advise Starfleet
of our status, Mr. Data.

768
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,291
When Admiral Kennelly calls,
I'll speak to him

769
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:02,041
in my ready room.

770
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:11,166
It seemed, Admiral,
that they knew our course,

771
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:13,583
our destination,
our plan.

772
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,041
I'm sure they monitor
the border at all times

773
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:18,041
for terrorist
activity.

774
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:20,000
Their sensors must have
picked up Orta's ship,

775
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,000
that's all.

776
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,834
I'm not convinced of that.

777
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,375
The important thing
is what do we do now.

778
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:28,375
Do you have any
suggestions, Admiral?

779
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:30,000
Your top priority is

780
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,417
to protect
the Cardassian treaty.

781
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,291
Sir, I see no way to protect
the Cardassian peace

782
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:37,583
without sacrificing
the Bajoran.

783
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,208
If that's your call,
I'll support it.

784
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:44,375
No. I'm not willing
to give them up.

785
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:47,959
I don't think you're looking
at the big picture, Jean-Luc.

786
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,500
We can't afford to lose
the Cardassian treaty.

787
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:54,667
Well, I just see a different
big picture, Admiral.

788
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:56,792
It looks something
like this--

789
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,417
I see
the Cardassian liaison

790
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:01,834
with his
Cardassian virus

791
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,041
coming to meet with you

792
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:04,875
after the attack
on Solarion Four.

793
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:07,792
"Now we have a common enemy,"
he says.

794
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:09,542
The Bajoran terrorists.

795
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:11,917
The Cardassians
can't find them,

796
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:14,834
but maybe
the Federation can.

797
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:18,333
I am beginning
to see...

798
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:23,125
that our mission has,
in fact, been to expose Orta

799
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,709
so that the Cardassians

800
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,542
can move in
and destroy him.

801
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:31,291
I think you've lost
your perspective, Captain.

802
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,709
We'll discuss this further
when you return.

803
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,875
For now, I'm giving you
a direct order to withdraw.

804
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,500
Kennelly out.

805
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:55,458
Ensign Ro, set a course
bearing 187.102.

806
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,917
One-quarter impulse.

807
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:58,542
Aye, sir.

808
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,625
He's ordered us
to withdraw?

809
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:14,750
The Cardassians are moving

810
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:16,792
toward the Bajoran vessel,
Captain.

811
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,208
Hold present course.

812
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:32,125
The Bajoran ship
has been destroyed.

813
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:35,875
Subspace signal coming in
from Starfleet, Captain.

814
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:37,500
Admiral Kennelly.

815
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:39,500
On screen.

816
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:41,542
It is on a secure
channel, sir.

817
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,041
In your ready room?

818
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,375
No.

819
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:46,291
Here.
On screen.

820
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,917
Report.

821
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:51,792
The Cardassians
have destroyed

822
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:53,542
the Bajoran ship,
Admiral.

823
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,792
All hands lost?

824
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:58,250
PICARD:
No, sir.

825
00:40:58,291 --> 00:40:59,542
Survivors?

826
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,750
No, sir.
No one was on board.

827
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,291
What are you talking
about?

828
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,291
The ship was controlled
from the ground.

829
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,166
Communication
was handled through

830
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,375
a subspace relay
on the vessel.

831
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:11,583
This was your idea,
Picard?

832
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:12,959
Actually, no.

833
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,667
This was Ensign Ro's idea,

834
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:16,667
but I fully endorsed it--
I suspected that

835
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:18,750
something like this
might occur.

836
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,792
They're terrorists,
damn it.

837
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:22,792
Why in the hell would
you want to protect them?

838
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:24,583
Admiral,
I am more concerned

839
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:27,709
with protecting the honor
and integrity of Starfleet.

840
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,417
Do you know how many
of our people

841
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,417
they killed
on Solarion Four?

842
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:34,375
The Bajorans did not attack
Solarion Four.

843
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:36,291
Who told you that?
Orta?

844
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,667
PICARD:
Yes.

845
00:41:37,709 --> 00:41:39,250
And you<i> believed</i> him?

846
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:43,750
Admiral, Orta's ships are
old and obsolete.

847
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,583
They don't even
have warp capabilities.

848
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,000
They couldn't have reached
another star system,

849
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:49,583
let alone
attacked one.

850
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,041
Then who is
responsible?

851
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:54,000
I'd suggest that
you ask your friend,

852
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,000
the Cardassian liaison,
Admiral.

853
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,959
The only explanation

854
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,291
I can think of...

855
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,750
is that the Cardassians
staged it.

856
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:05,792
The Cardassians? Why?

857
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:09,500
Perhaps they were hoping
to find someone in Starfleet

858
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:11,750
like you, Admiral,

859
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:15,709
naive enough to solve
their Bajoran problem for them.

860
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,375
What will
happen to him?

861
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:30,583
I'm not sure.
A hearing, certainly.

862
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:33,000
Probably
a court-martial.

863
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:36,709
Well, if he gets sent
to the stockade on Jaros Two,

864
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,625
tell him to request
a room in the east wing.

865
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:41,333
The west wing gets awfully
hot in the afternoons.

866
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:43,750
How soon do you
intend to return

867
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:45,625
to Lya Station
Alpha, sir?

868
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:47,083
In a few weeks.

869
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:50,083
We have some surveying
to do in sector 21305.

870
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:51,417
Perhaps
I should arrange

871
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:53,875
for some other
transportation back.

872
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:56,041
Ensign,

873
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:57,583
you were recruited
for one mission,

874
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:00,417
and if you wish to be
relieved of further duty,

875
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:01,917
I can certainly
arrange it.

876
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:05,875
But I'd like you to consider
remaining in Starfleet.

877
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,750
You're not serious.
Mm-hmm.

878
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:09,834
I think it would be
a shame for Starfleet

879
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:12,417
to lose someone
of your potential.

880
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,083
Well, thank you,
Captain...

881
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,583
but this uniform...

882
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:20,667
it just doesn't fit,
and you know it.

883
00:43:20,709 --> 00:43:22,625
That can change.

884
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,750
I don't think so.

885
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,041
I've noticed
qualities in you

886
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:32,291
that could be
harnessed, molded.

887
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,291
Don't count on it.

888
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:37,291
I think you've got a great deal
to learn from Starfleet.

889
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:41,375
I always thought Starfleet had
a lot to learn from me, Captain.

890
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:44,208
That's an attitude
that I have found common

891
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,917
among the best officers
I've ever served with.

892
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,417
But you're not
one of them yet.

893
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:52,667
But you could be,
if you work at it.

894
00:43:52,709 --> 00:43:55,041
That's an interesting
challenge,

895
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:59,000
and I rarely refuse
an interesting challenge.

896
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,208
There would have
to be one condition.

897
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:04,000
Condition?

898
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,250
Picard to<i> Enterprise.</i>

899
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,000
Two to beam up.
