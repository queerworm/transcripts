1
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:05,709
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47254.1.</i>

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,083
<i>A delegation of the Cairn</i>
<i>have just come on board.</i>

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:11,875
<i>This telepathic species has</i>
<i>no concept of spoken language</i>

4
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:15,500
<i>and is being instructed</i>
<i>in its use by... an old friend.</i>

5
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:18,583
I don't know what they'd
have done without me.

6
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,834
First, I had to learn
how they communicate.

7
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,834
Well, it was an absolutely
exhausting process.

8
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,000
It must have been.

9
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,792
Quite different from
Betazed telepathy.

10
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:27,375
We transmit words.

11
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:29,834
With the Cairn, it's,
uh... it's images--

12
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,875
a-a flood of them,
all at the same time.

13
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:34,792
It's overwhelming.
I can imagine.

14
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,667
Actually, it's
a very efficient way

15
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:38,041
of communicating.

16
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,750
If two Cairn were having
this conversation

17
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:41,917
it would have been
over minutes ago.

18
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,000
Really?

19
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,375
Of course, they realize

20
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:46,250
that they'll want to
communicate verbally

21
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,875
if they join
the Federation.

22
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,625
Oh, do me a favor.

23
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,834
Introduce yourself
to one of them.

24
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,333
Engage him
in conversation.

25
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,792
They need the practice.

26
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,250
I'd be happy to.

27
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,375
It's called a visor.

28
00:00:57,417 --> 00:00:59,041
It enables
me to see.

29
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,792
Like my vocal enhancer.

30
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:02,792
It helps me
make sounds.

31
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:05,083
I see you've already
met my star pupil.

32
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,875
Hedril's picked up
spoken language

33
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:09,875
much faster
than the others.

34
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:11,166
It is often the case
that children

35
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,583
learn languages
more easily than adults.

36
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,250
Deanna was quite
good at languages

37
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,959
when she was little.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,667
Where is Deanna?

39
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:21,125
Well, she must be here
somewhere.

40
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,375
Hedril, darling...?

41
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,083
What?

42
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,625
Um... go find
your father, dear.

43
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:32,750
I want to talk to him.

44
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,083
Mrs. Troi?

45
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,792
Oh, I'm just
a little tired.

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,250
This constant telepathy
with the Cairn...

47
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,166
um... no, I'm...

48
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,250
I'm fine, really.

49
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,458
Aren't you going
to mingle, Mr. Woof?

50
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,125
I do not care
for telepaths.

51
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,542
They make me...
uneasy.

52
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,375
Oh, don't worry.

53
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:10,041
The Cairn couldn't
read your thoughts

54
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,917
even if they wanted to.

55
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,625
Your brain isn't
sophisticated enough.

56
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,166
Neither
is yours, dear.

57
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,917
They can only communicate
with other telepaths.

58
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,417
Have either of you
seen Deanna?

59
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,583
She was working,
but she said she would be...

60
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,792
Speak of the devil.

61
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,375
Sorry I'm late.

62
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,417
I lost track
of the time.

63
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,792
Deanna dear,
come with me.

64
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,750
I want you to meet
the senior diplomat

65
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,041
of the Cairn delegation.

66
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,917
Maques, this is
the beautiful daughter

67
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,625
I've been telling
you about, Deanna.

68
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,959
Pleased to...

69
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,500
Hello.

70
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:57,875
Hello.

71
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:58,792
Pleased to meet you.

72
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:01,834
Oh, yes...
that is it.

73
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,458
Pleased to meet
you, Deanna.

74
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,250
Good. Well, I'll just let
you young people chat.

75
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,375
Well, Maques

76
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:16,000
what do you think
of the<i> Enterprise?</i>

77
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,166
Oh...
it is beautiful.

78
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,667
Comfortable, also.

79
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,500
I'm glad you
think so.

80
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:26,166
Uh...

81
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,000
there is another word
that describes it.

82
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:34,250
But I cannot remember.

83
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,667
You've learned a great deal
in a very short time.

84
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,041
I'm sure it
won't be long

85
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,458
before your words do justice
to your thoughts.

86
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,792
Your mother...

87
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,583
told me...

88
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,750
of your need.

89
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,375
Need?

90
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:53,375
Uh, a moment.

91
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,000
Husband.

92
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,417
You need a husband.

93
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,166
I...

94
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,250
need a wife.

95
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,583
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

96
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,333
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

97
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,083
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

98
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,291
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

99
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:57,750
<i>... to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

100
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,667
<i>... to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

101
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,166
Oh, Deanna?

102
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,834
Oh... good morning.

103
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,250
So, what did you
think of Maques?

104
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,625
Why did you do that,
Mother?

105
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,125
You embarrassed
both of us.

106
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,500
Oh, he's really
very sweet.

107
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,834
And lonely, poor man.

108
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,000
A widower,
raising a child alone.

109
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,333
Mother, don't start.

110
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,417
I just think it's time
for you to settle down

111
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,792
and if your father
were still alive

112
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,333
I'm sure he'd
say the same thing.

113
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,709
Deck eight.

114
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,792
<i>But you'll do exactly</i>
<i>what you want...</i>

115
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,333
<i>just like always.</i>

116
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,542
Mother, stop it.

117
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,709
Are you coming?

118
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,125
What's wrong?

119
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,875
(<i> sighs</i> )

120
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,417
You are so
precious to me.

121
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:05,750
You're all I've got.

122
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,417
If something happened to you
I don't know what I'd do.

123
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,709
Nothing's going
to happen to me.

124
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,417
You'd better go.

125
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,291
My first appointment
isn't for a few minutes.

126
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,875
Why don't we talk
for awhile?

127
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,959
No, I'm fine.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,667
I'm just tired from working
with the Cairn.

129
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:31,667
It's making me emotional.

130
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:33,250
Are you sure?

131
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,041
Mm-hmm. Go on.

132
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:37,709
I'll see you later.

133
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,875
Go on.

134
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,291
Maques.

135
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,000
I must... apologize...
for yesterday.

136
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,083
You don't have to.

137
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,583
My words...
they were... confused.

138
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,166
It wasn't your fault.

139
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,458
Please.

140
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,166
My mother misled you.

141
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,625
Not in everything.

142
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:24,792
She has...

143
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,417
an image of you

144
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,291
in her mind.

145
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,583
She shared it with me.

146
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,333
You are even
more beautiful.

147
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,041
The way my people
communicate...

148
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,625
it is... direct.

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,542
Nothing is hidden.

150
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,583
Yes?

151
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:59,625
Your mother is the first
to learn our telepathy.

152
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,000
You mean you've never
had telepathy

153
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,750
with someone
who wasn't Cairn?

154
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:05,834
No.

155
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,417
To communicate
with her is...

156
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,166
very different.

157
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,500
In what way?

158
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,542
Always, there is
a part of her that...

159
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,375
um...

160
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:28,083
a part of her
that is... dark.

161
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,250
Dark?

162
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:39,208
A part of her that...
cannot be seen.

163
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:42,959
Do you understand?

164
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,625
I'm not sure.

165
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,000
Have you asked my mother
about this?

166
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,333
Um...
she called it...

167
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:55,792
a moment.

168
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,583
Um... privacy.

169
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,458
Of course.

170
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,542
You said among the Cairn
nothing is hidden.

171
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:12,208
We value honesty,
but we don't always share

172
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,125
everything we're thinking
and feeling.

173
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:19,375
This is... privacy?

174
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,250
Yes.

175
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,500
It is... normal?

176
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:25,750
For us, yes.

177
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,208
If this
is your way...

178
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,959
I am relieved.

179
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,667
It<i> is</i> our way.

180
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,667
I will leave now.

181
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,250
I'm glad you
stopped by.

182
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,542
I'm glad to
have stopped also.

183
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,375
I was all set for another
round of arguing

184
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,667
when all of a sudden,
she just fell apart.

185
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:07,875
She's under
a lot of stress.

186
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,000
She's preparing the Cairn

187
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,542
to meet with
the Federation Council.

188
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,458
It's more than that.

189
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sensing some very
erratic emotions from her.

190
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,000
Even the clothes she's
wearing are unusual.

191
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,417
They're so subdued.

192
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,583
Maybe you just need

193
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,125
to sit and talk with her
for a minute.

194
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,667
LWAXANA:
Commander!

195
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:27,375
Take your hands
off her!

196
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,792
Mrs. Troi...
Don't you "Mrs. Troi" me!

197
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:29,917
Mother...

198
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,417
Why don't you leave
her alone?

199
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,041
If it weren't for you,
she'd be married by now!

200
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,625
That's enough.

201
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:37,250
Now, I am warning you--
stay away from my daughter!

202
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,792
You're coming
with me.

203
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,875
Oh, I don't know
what got into me.

204
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:50,041
Oh... please, tell Will
how sorry I am.

205
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,583
You're fine

206
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,834
but you're psilosynine
levels are a little low.

207
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,208
Psilo... hmm?

208
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,375
It's a neurotransmitter
involved in telepathy.

209
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,417
It's been depleted

210
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,208
by your work
with the Cairn.

211
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,667
You're going to
have to try to avoid

212
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:04,750
telepathic communication
for a while.

213
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:05,792
I can't.

214
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:06,959
Why?

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,667
We only have
three days left

216
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:09,792
and, uh...

217
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,583
oh, the Cairn have
so much to learn.

218
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,792
Lwaxana, I'm sorry

219
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,041
but you're going to have
to take some time and rest.

220
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,583
Maybe I can help
with the Cairn.

221
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,667
No, you're only
half Betazoid, dear.

222
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,709
And you have no experience
with their form of telepathy.

223
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,625
Then I won't use
telepathy.

224
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,041
We'll work verbally.

225
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,583
I suppose
we could do that.

226
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,083
And if they don't
understand something

227
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,208
I'll explain it to them
telepathically.

228
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,458
No, you'll work
verbally, too.

229
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,917
The point is for you
to get some rest, Mother.

230
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,417
Besides, it'll
do them good

231
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,166
to have to figure
things out with words.

232
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:56,875
I suppose you're right.

233
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,458
TROI:
This is the ship's
arboretum.

234
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,041
"Arbor" means tree.

235
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,250
Very good, Hedril.

236
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,417
This is where people
come to relax...

237
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,375
enjoy themselves
in a natural setting.

238
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,792
"Flowers of all hue

239
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,583
and without thorn,
the rose."

240
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,792
It's an old earth poem
by John Milton.

241
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,667
Please.

242
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,750
What is a... poem?

243
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,417
Poetry is an art form
that uses words

244
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,875
put together
in new and unexpected ways

245
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,834
sometimes in rhyme.

246
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,500
Milton was speculating
that in heaven

247
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,917
roses wouldn't have thorns.

248
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,625
Heaven?

249
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,166
Oh.

250
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,792
Oh, uh...

251
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:50,875
heaven is...

252
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,875
Well, it's, um...

253
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,000
How can
I put it?

254
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,583
Yes, I see.

255
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,667
Thank you.

256
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:01,125
"Heaven."

257
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,208
Mother, you're supposed
to be avoiding telepathy.

258
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm only trying
to help, dear.

259
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,834
You don't look well.

260
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,333
I'm just tired.

261
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,000
Maybe I'll sit down.

262
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:21,583
Don't worry.
She'll be fine.

263
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,875
This is something
I think you'll
find interesting.

264
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,417
It's a jewel plant
from Folnar III.

265
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,542
The plant secretes
a resin...

266
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,917
(<i> Hedril laughing</i> )

267
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,000
...which is collected
within the blossom.

268
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,542
By the time
the bloom has faded

269
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,166
the resin has hardened into
a rare and beautiful gem.

270
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,166
Mother!

271
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,083
Mother...
Troi to Sick Bay.

272
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,667
Medical emergency
in the arboretum.

273
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:57,750
CRUSHER:
She's not responding
to cortical stimulation.

274
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,375
I'm not sure
what else I can do.

275
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,834
I don't understand.

276
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,709
She was fine
just yesterday.

277
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,792
It's so strange.

278
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:07,166
It's almost
as if her brain

279
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,750
has shut itself down.

280
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,542
Is there a
physiological cause?

281
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,458
I'm running
a subneural scan.

282
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
As far as I can see
there's no tissue damage

283
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,166
no neurochemical imbalance

284
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,375
no sign of infection,
nothing.

285
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,000
Yet her neural activity
is practically nonexistent.

286
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,667
The only exception
is in the paracortex.

287
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:26,417
Activity there
is almost off the scale.

288
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,709
The paracortex is
the Betazoid telepathic lobe.

289
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,250
She communicated with
Maques telepathically

290
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,709
just before she fell.

291
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,250
Might there be
some side effects

292
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,542
of Cairn telepathy of which
we're unaware?

293
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,750
It's a possibility.

294
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,208
I think it's time

295
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,000
that you and I had
a talk with Maques.

296
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,542
I am very...

297
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,500
apologetic

298
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:59,375
for what has happened
to your mother.

299
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,583
Maques, is it possible

300
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,375
that your telepathic
communications

301
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,834
with Mrs. Troi
harmed her in some way?

302
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,417
No.

303
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,875
I tried to...
to explain before.

304
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,417
Bad thoughts--
they hurt her.

305
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,458
TROI:
What thoughts?

306
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,583
Take your time.

307
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,208
Inside her.

308
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,125
The... dark place.

309
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:29,583
I don't understand.

310
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,417
She is...
um...

311
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,959
What are the words?

312
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,333
I don't
have the words.

313
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,333
(<i> gasps</i> )

314
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,667
Counselor?

315
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:04,583
Stop it.

316
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,625
It's all right.

317
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:11,834
I'm fine.

318
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,000
He was just trying

319
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,917
to communicate with me
telepathically.

320
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,917
Do you understand now?

321
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,458
I'm not sure.

322
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,625
He communicated
so much to me

323
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:30,583
that, at first, it was
just a jumble of images.

324
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,792
Have you been able
to sort any of it out?

325
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,375
I think so.

326
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,458
During his telepathic
contact with my mother

327
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,667
Maques sensed what he
calls "a dark place."

328
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,667
He tried to tell
me about it before

329
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,291
in my office, and
I misunderstood.

330
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,166
I thought he was
talking about

331
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,166
thoughts my mother
was keeping private

332
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,834
but what he meant
was that there

333
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,667
was something happening
in her metaconscious mind.

334
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:57,375
Metaconscious?

335
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,166
It's part of
the Betazoid psyche.

336
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,417
It's a kind of filtering
mechanism

337
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,792
that protects us
from psychic trauma.

338
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,000
Is Maques suggesting

339
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,583
that your mother's
metaconscious

340
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,250
has been somehow damaged?

341
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,834
He feels that whatever
is wrong with her

342
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,709
is centered there.

343
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,291
If he's right,
it may mean

344
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,041
that she's suffered
some kind of trauma

345
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,709
that her metaconscious
just can't tolerate.

346
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,083
Has your mother
mentioned anything

347
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,542
that happened to
her lately?

348
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,500
Something that might have
been traumatic for her?

349
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,834
No, nothing.

350
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,750
Maques could be wrong
about this.

351
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,625
There's still a chance
that a subneural scan

352
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,917
might be able to pinpoint
a physiological cause

353
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,291
for your mother's condition

354
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,667
something that
I might be able to treat.

355
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:38,875
The results won't be in
until morning.

356
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,750
Maybe we should all
try and get some rest.

357
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,583
I'd like to
stay here with her.

358
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,125
I'm going to try
and contact her

359
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,375
telepathically.

360
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,125
All right.

361
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,291
TROI:
<i>Mother?</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

362
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,583

00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,917
<i>Please.</i>

364
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,875
LWAXANA (<i> weakly</i> ):
<i>Help me...</i>

365
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,250
<i>Mother?</i>

366
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,750
<i>Help... me.</i>

367
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,333
<i>How?</i>

368
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,709
<i>How can I help you?</i>

369
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,959
Tell me, Mother.

370
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,250
Please.

371
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:54,375
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

372
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:13,625
Computer, lights.

373
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,583
What are you doing?

374
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,875
Maques, what were you
doing in Sick Bay?

375
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,917
Helping.

376
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,500
Trying...
to help Lwaxana.

377
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:33,208
How? What were you
trying to do?

378
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,709
I was...

379
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,500
She was...

380
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,667
You, Deanna.

381
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:42,125
Maybe you.

382
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,125
Yes?

383
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,250
You must...

384
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,667
How can I explain?

385
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:50,166
Tell me telepathically.

386
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,625
Maques believes

387
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:15,333
my mother's psyche has
collapsed in on itself--

388
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,709
that for some reason

389
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,500
she has retreated
into her metaconscious mind.

390
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,458
Was he trying to contact
her telepathically?

391
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,041
Yes. He was able
to access images

392
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,291
being generated
by her metaconscious

393
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,333
but he couldn't make
any sense of them.

394
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,000
I did not...
understand.

395
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,125
He saw faces
he didn't recognize

396
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,041
events he couldn't
interpret.

397
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,542
If we could decipher
these images

398
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,917
we might be
able to determine

399
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,417
whether or not your
mother's condition

400
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,041
was induced by
a traumatic event.

401
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,542
Maques feels he can provide
a telepathic bridge

402
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,709
that would allow me to access
my mother's metaconscious.

403
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,000
If he can,
I might be able

404
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,667
to find out
what happened to her.

405
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,875
And if you succeed,
can you use that
information

406
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,458
to help your mother?

407
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,667
I'm not sure

408
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:58,291
but I do know
that there's a part of her

409
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,041
that wants to be helped.

410
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,125
When I tried to contact
her telepathically

411
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,083
I heard a voice
calling out to me.

412
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,792
If your mother's psyche
has collapsed in on itself

413
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:09,625
could accessing her mind
pose any danger to you?

414
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:12,583
There's no way to know.

415
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,166
I'd like to try.

416
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,291
I'll be monitoring her
throughout

417
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,750
the entire procedure.

418
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,375
If anything
goes wrong

419
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,250
Maques can break
the telepathic link.

420
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,333
Your mother, part of her
is very frightened.

421
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,750
She may...
resist you.

422
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,458
I understand.

can you hear me?

Captain?

431
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,333
Deanna, Dr. Crusher
has become concerned

432
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,417
that your paracortical
readings have become erratic.

433
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,667
Are you talking to me
from Sick Bay?

434
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,750
Yes. I want you to sever your
connection to your mother.

435
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,291
Why don't you
ask Maques to do it?

436
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,542
I'm asking you.

437
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,959
That is an order,
Counselor.

438
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:40,834
You're not

451
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,959
Look at you.

452
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,041
You've become
a beautiful woman.

453
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,041
Don't do this.

454
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,166
I'm sorry I had to go away
when you were so little.

455
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,208
I didn't want to.

456
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,333
You're not my father.

457
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,917
You're part of
my mother's mind.

458
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,333
What is this place?

459
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:01,417
This is our house near
Lake El-Nar on Betazed.

460
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,542
We used to live here.

461
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:08,417
Deanna, let's not
waste this chance.

462
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,792
I want to hear
everything about you.

463
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,667
Did I live here?

464
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:16,125
For a while,
when you were a baby.

465
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,542
You were such
a beautiful baby.

466
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,709
Your mother and I
loved you so much.

467
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,542
I don't
remember these toys.

468
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,041
I bet you don't
remember me

469
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,250
singing you to sleep at
night either, but I did.

470
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:36,875
I do remember.

471
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:40,875
I always felt safe
when you sang to me.

472
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:46,083
There was one song you
always asked me to sing.

473
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,041
You couldn't fall asleep
unless you heard it.

474
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:51,750
"Down in the Valley."

475
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:52,834
Yes.

00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,417
keep me from
finding something.

482
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,083
Your mother doesn't
want to see you, Deanna.

483
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,208
I have to help her.

484
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,709
If you want to
help her, leave.

485
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,625
Let her have peace.

486
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:25,333
She called out
to me.

487
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,375
She does
want me to help.

488
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,875
Stay with me--
just a little while.

489
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,542
Deanna, it's been so long.

490
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
We'll never have
this chance again.

491
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,250
Good-bye, Daddy.

492
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:57,208
(<i> liquid gurgling</i> )

493
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,542
Hedril.

494
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,250
Mother.

495
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,709
Get away from here!

496
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,834
No!

497
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,375
Hedril, I asked your father
to bring you here

498
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,250
because I wanted to talk
to you about something.

499
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:43,417
You know that Lwaxana
is sick, don't you?

500
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:46,667
Yes.
Is it my fault?

501
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:49,583
No, not at all.

502
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:53,166
But I believe that she's
been thinking about you.

503
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,333
Do you know why?

504
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,083
I make her sad.

505
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,041
Why do you
say that?

506
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,875
Because it's true.

507
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,083
Do you have any idea

508
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,792
why Hedril would
make my mother sad?

509
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:09,291
No.

510
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,709
Well, thank you for
coming to talk to us.

511
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,166
I'll see you later,
all right?

512
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:20,208
Counselor, I hope your
mother gets better.

513
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:22,542
Thank you, Hedril.

514
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:23,709
So do I.

515
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:33,458
I just don't understand
how she fits into all this.

516
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,041
And I haven't found
a physiological cause

517
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,291
for what's happened
to your mother--

518
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,417
which makes me feel
that Maques was right

519
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:40,750
when he said your mother's
condition

520
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:43,709
was precipitated
by a traumatic event.

521
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,542
Could this event
have involved Hedril?

522
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:47,542
I don't think so.

523
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:48,834
My mother never
mentioned her.

524
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,166
Does your mother keep
personal logs or a journal?

525
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,875
Yes, she does.

526
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:56,875
I'll contact
Mr. Homn on Betazed

527
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:59,667
and ask him to transmit
a copy as soon as possible.

528
00:29:59,709 --> 00:30:01,291
There may be some
clues there.

529
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,625
Perhaps we are
being too literal.

530
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,458
I have recently
learned in my study
of dream analysis

531
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,709
that people who
appear in a dream

532
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,417
can sometimes represent
different aspects

533
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:11,750
of the person
who is dreaming.

534
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:12,917
That's right!

535
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:15,250
A child might
represent vulnerability.

536
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:18,000
Hedril may depict some fragile
part of my mother.

537
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:20,875
The part
that she's protecting.

538
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:24,000
You said that everything
you encountered

539
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,291
when you were in her mind

540
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,709
was a barrier
of one kind or another.

541
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,625
Yes-- you, the wolf,
my father...

542
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,625
It was as though
she were

543
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,166
summoning all
her defenses to keep me away.

544
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:39,083
But keep me away
from what?

545
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,250
What is she protecting?

546
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,583
(<i> sighs</i> )

547
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:32,291
(<i> door chimes</i> )

548
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,375
Come in.

549
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,417
Counselor.

550
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:42,166
Hello, Captain.

551
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,375
I've just come
from Sick Bay.

552
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:46,166
Dr. Crusher feels

553
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,583
that your mother's
condition is worsening.

554
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:51,250
Her neural foundations
are getting weaker.

555
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,166
Have you had
any luck here?

556
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,959
No, nothing.

557
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,959
I've gone through
all her belongings.

558
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,625
I've read her journal for
the last five years.

559
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:08,750
And, other than the fact
that I'm not married yet

560
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:10,500
nothing bad seems to have
happened to her.

561
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,667
Is this your father?

562
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:15,917
Yes.

563
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,208
He had a kind face.

564
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:23,917
I remember when he died

565
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,583
my mother had to go
through all his things

566
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:27,917
and pack them away.

567
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,083
I was seven.

568
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:32,750
I remember thinking
how mad he'd be

569
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:34,917
when he came home
and saw what she'd done.

570
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:39,375
I didn't understand
he wasn't coming back.

571
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,417
Deanna, your mother might
still come out of this.

572
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:48,500
If we can't figure out
what's wrong with her, Captain

573
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:49,583
I don't think she will.

574
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:54,583
But I don't know
what else to do.

575
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,875
I've talked with Mr. Homn,
who's known her for years.

576
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,458
I've checked her
medical records.

577
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,417
I've made inquiries to
the government on Betazed.

578
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:07,542
I've contacted her
closest friends.

579
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:12,125
If she's been through some
kind of psychic trauma

580
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,250
there's just
no evidence of it.

581
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,834
You say that you've
reviewed her journals

582
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,250
for the past five years.

583
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:18,792
Maybe we should
go further back.

584
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,083
That's a lot to review.

585
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,166
My mother's kept
a journal

586
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,834
since before
she was married.

587
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,291
Then let's start
at the beginning.

588
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

589
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,709
First entry seems to be
stardate 30620.1.

590
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,291
That's the year
they were married.

591
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:42,208
Hmm. That's odd.

592
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:45,000
There's a seven-year gap.

593
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,542
It starts about a year
after the wedding.

594
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:52,792
If I'm not mistaken,
it ends

595
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:55,083
a few months
after your birth.

596
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,583
My mother's so diligent
about her journal.

597
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,625
Why would she have stopped
making entries for so long?

598
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,500
She didn't.

599
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,250
The files were
deleted...

600
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:05,875
by your mother

601
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:07,583
almost
30 years ago.

602
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,041
I don't understand
any of this.

603
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:20,583
Captain, I have to go back
inside my mother's mind.

604
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,125
It's the only way we're ever
going to get any answers.

605
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,417
Thank you.

606
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:37,000
Deanna, you understand

607
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,792
that if your paracortical
readings get too high again

608
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:42,041
I'm going to tell Maques
to sever the connection?

609
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,291
I know.

612

Who is Hedril?

613
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:40,667
Wait!

614
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:41,917
I want to talk to you.

No.

623
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,417
I want to help you.

624
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,375
Why did you delete
parts of your journal?

625
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,166
Did something
happen to you

626
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,083
you don't want me
to know about?

627

Leave me alone,
please.

628
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:15,500
Who's Hedril, Mother?

629
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:16,750
Why is she here?

630
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,834
Is Hedril me, when
I was a little girl?

631
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,041
No.

632
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,375
Oh, no.

00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:25,917
I'd never let anything
happen to you, never.

Did you let something
happen to someone?

635

Was it here,
at El-Nar?

636

You were just a baby.

00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,959
Tell me.

What happened next?

You have
to let it go.

How can I?

a terrible tragedy--

that can happen

but it was an accident.

And what you're doing
isn't fair to Kestra.

was good
and joyous about her

not mourn it.
