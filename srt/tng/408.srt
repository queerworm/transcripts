<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44286.5.</i>

2
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:07,709
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is conducting</i>
<i>a security survey</i>

3
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:10,500
<i>of the Onias Sector</i>
<i>near the Neutral Zone.</i>

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,875
<i>Despite our proximity</i>
<i>to Romulan territory</i>

5
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,500
<i>the mission has been quiet</i>
<i>and uneventful.</i>

6
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:20,834
(<i> playing "Misty" poorly</i> )

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,875
(<i> chuckling</i> )

8
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,208
All right, Commander,
you've got until

9
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,667
your next birthday
to get that right.

10
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,417
Some things
improve with age.

11
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:31,750
Maybe your trombone playing
will be one of them.

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,917
It's candle time,
birthday boy.

13
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,250
Whoo!
All right.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,875
So, what did you
wish for, Will?

15
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,250
Music lessons.

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,875
(<i> all laughing</i> )

17
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:49,166
Mr. Data, we must hurry

18
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,959
or we'll miss
Commander Riker's party.

19
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:53,834
Sir, I find it interesting

20
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:55,458
how much importance
humans place

21
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,458
on celebrating the day
of their birth--

22
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,000
a day they cannot
possibly remember.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,875
Captain, I am detecting
some unusual fluctuations

24
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,417
in subspace frequencies.

25
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,917
We'd better take a look
at it, Mr. Data.

26
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,291
It appears
we are being probed, sir.

27
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,834
The source?

28
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,792
DATA:
The third planet
of the Alpha Onias system.

29
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:21,834
Our reports list it

30
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,792
as presently uninhabited.

31
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,834
Perhaps reports
were incorrect, sir.

32
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:29,834
Or maybe the rumors
of a secret Romulan base

33
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,625
in this sector are true.

34
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:34,959
Picard to Commander Riker.

35
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,542
I apologize for interrupting
your celebration

36
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:39,250
but I'm going to need
an away team.

37
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,083
Would you report
to the Bridge, please?

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Although Alpha Onias III
is a Class-M planet

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,083
our survey teams
have listed it as

40
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,041
"barren and inhospitable."

41
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,083
Any life signs?

42
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,375
No, sir.

43
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,375
But we have traced
residual energy readings

44
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,917
to a cavern two kilometers
beneath the surface.

45
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,667
WORF:
Romulans.

46
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,125
It is possible.

47
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,291
I suppose you'll just
have to go down there

48
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,417
and find out.

49
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:15,250
Geordi, Worf,
you're with me.

50
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,250
Number One?

51
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,041
Happy birthday.

52
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,625
I'm detecting high levels
of volcanic gases--

53
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,125
sulfur dioxide,

54
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,834
methane, hydrogen sulfide.

55
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,208
Toxic?

56
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,542
Uh, we're okay for now,
but I wouldn't

57
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,625
want to spend
my vacation here.

58
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,667
What about energy readings?

59
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,208
Magnetic clutter
is increasing.

60
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,834
I cannot make an
accurate determination.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,458
Same here, Commander.

62
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,291
I'm getting a lot
of confusing readings here.

63
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,250

Picard to Riker,
please acknowledge.

64
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,375
Riker here.

65
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,166
We're having trouble
reading you.

66
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,166
And we're having similar
difficulties reading you.

67
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,333
I'm advising you
and your away team

68
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,750
to transport up at once.

69
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,041
That's good advice,
Commander.

70
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,750
We've got a sudden build-up
of gases here,

71
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,000
especially methane.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,250
(<i> coughs</i> )
Transporter Room

73
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,208
take us up.

74
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,542
(<i> alarm beeps</i> )

75
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:26,917
I can't get
a solid lock on you, sir.

76
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:28,583
There's too much interference.

77
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,709
I'm trying again.

78
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,500
(<i> all coughing</i> )

79
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,000

what's happening?

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,083
Report!

81
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,125

That's good.

Confused.

What is going on here?

109
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,041
Sit.

110
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,375
Please.

111
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,250
What is the last thing
that you remember clearly?

112
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,583
Alpha Onias III.

113
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,792
The<i> Enterprise</i>
had been probed.

114
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:03,458
Geordi, Worf and I
transported down

115
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,625
to track the source.

116
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,208
But all you found there
was toxic gas.

117
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,583
They barely had time
to get the three of you out.

118
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,083
Will, that happened
16 years ago.

119
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,250
That's not possible.

120
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,291
With an Altarian virus,
anything is possible.

121
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,458
In fact, we've been
expecting this.

122
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,041
Could you be more specific?

123
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,750
That day on Onias III,
you were infected

124
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,834
with a strain of
Altarian encephalitis--

125
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:43,125
a retrovirus that
incorporates its DNA

126
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,333
directly into
the cells of its host.

127
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,125
It can lie dormant
for many years

128
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,333
and then suddenly
become active again

129
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,709
as it did in your case
ten days ago.

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,750
You have been in a coma,
delirious.

131
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,750
Your fever finally
broke this morning.

132
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,834
But what happened to my memory?

133
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:06,959
Let me show you a scan
of your brain tissue.

134
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,709
When the encephalitis
became active

135
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:17,458
it caused widespread
synapse degradation

136
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,125
interrupting the
consolidation of
your memory patterns.

137
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,417
Doctor.

138
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:30,291
Will, this virus
inevitably causes

139
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,125
memory loss back
to the moment

140
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,083
of the original infection.

141
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,458
In your case,
all the way back

142
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,917
to Alpha Onias III.

143
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:38,959
I don't believe this.

144
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,083
Is this a dream?

145
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,625
Feel my hand.

146
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,625
It is flesh and bone.

147
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,166
This is not a dream.

148
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,542
And you are, in fact,
Captain William T. Riker

149
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,333
in command
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

150
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,500
The<i> Enterprise.</i>

151
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,792
For how long?

152
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,750
Nine years.

153
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,333
If I've lost
my memory,

154
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,083
how do I get it back?

155
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,583
Memories are formed
by association.

156
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,917
Smells, sounds

157
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,458
and images
from the present

158
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,875
could possibly
trigger them.

159
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,125
Like a song reminds you
of an old friend.

160
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,250
Exactly.

161
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,709
In associational therapy

162
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:20,417
we expose the patient
to familiar surroundings.

163
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:22,959
This could stimulate the brain's
neural synapses

164
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,166
into regenerating.

165
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,583
Well, then let's get started.

166
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,625
There's nothing more familiar
than the<i> Enterprise.</i>

167
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,041
Maybe that'll bring back
some of my...

168
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,667
Will.

169
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,667
I said your memory<i> could</i> return.

170
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:37,750
In many of these cases,
the damage is permanent.

171
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,208
RIKER:
What about Geordi and Worf?

172
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,375
Were they infected, too?

173
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,542
Thankfully, no.

174
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,208
Geordi appears
to have been immune

175
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,583
and the Klingons don't seem
to be affected by the virus.

176
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,875
Speaking of Klingons.

177
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,583
There have been
quite a few changes

178
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,083
on the<i> Enterprise</i> during
the last 16 years.

179
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,208
Deck eight.

180
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,041
Belay that order.

181
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,166
We should begin
the associational

182
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,750
therapy in
your quarters.

183
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,333
Personal recollections
are always the most vivid.

184
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,417
My life was
on the Main Bridge.

185
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:14,291
Always has been.

186
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,750
If anything's going
to jog my memory...

187
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,959
Main Bridge.

188
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,834
COMPUTER:
Repeat command.

189
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:23,792
I said, Main Bridge.

190
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:25,041
The computer's been
slow all morning.

191
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,542
A processing
attenuator is down.

192
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,834
Commander La Forge has
been running a level-1

193
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:31,041
diagnostic on it to isolate the
problem.

194
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,041
Geordi.

195
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,667
Oh, it's good to see you
up and about again, sir.

196
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,709
Your eyes--
what happened to your VISOR?

197
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:49,291
My VISOR?

198
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,667
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

199
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,542
Dr. Crusher told us
that you might not remember.

200
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:53,834
I haven't needed a VISOR

201
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:55,959
since I got these cloned
implants, Captain.

202
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,083
Captain.

203
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,500
Welcome back, Captain.

204
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,709
We were not expecting
to see you

205
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,041
on the Bridge so soon.

206
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,125
Commander Data,
you are my First Officer?

207
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,750
Do you remember, sir?

208
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:23,500
Data, I haven't
remembered a day

209
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,417
for the last 16 years.

210
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,583
Captain, warbird uncloaking.

211
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,083
DATA:
On screen.

212
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,166
RIKER:
Shields up.

213
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,667
Red Alert.

214
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:39,500
Captain, we were expecting
the<i> Decius.</i>

215
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,250
There is no cause
for alarm.

216
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,834
Cancel Red Alert.

217
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,792
Clearly, I need to be briefed.

218
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:53,458
Captain, the<i> Decius</i>
is hailing us.

219
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,583
The Admiral wishes
to speak to you.

220
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,083
On screen.

221
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,875
Will.

222
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,959
Admiral Picard.

223
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,333
Deanna.

224
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,750
How are you feeling?

225
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,291
I've been better.

226
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,291
Not surprising,
Altarian viruses

227
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,458
can be a nasty business.

228
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,917
That's an understatement.

229
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,625
We'll discuss this
I can't even...

230
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,667
after we've transported over.

231
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,041
Picard out.

232
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,792
(<i> murmuring</i> )

233
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,750
Transporter Room Six.

234
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,875
How are you holding up?

235
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:41,041
I could get used to the idea
of a Ferengi ensign

236
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:44,250
but<i> Admiral</i> Picard
aboard a Romulan warbird?

237
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,417
What is that all about?

238
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,750
I think I should leave
all the explanations

239
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,500
to the Admiral.

240
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,458
Whenever you're
ready, Chief.

241
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,333
Captain Riker

242
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,792
it's good to see
you've recovered.

243
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:11,458
I'm not exactly sure
you'd call it
a recovery, sir.

244
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,458
Then there has been
some memory loss?

245
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,500
How much?

246
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,166
Everything
after Alpha Onias III.

247
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,417
To lose 16 years...

248
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,959
...it's almost beyond belief.

249
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:31,041
I have trouble
believing it myself.

250
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,542
It's so overwhelming to have
so much of your life missing.

251
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,000
And it couldn't have happened
at a worse time.

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,208
A few more days of relatively
simple negotiation

253
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,667
and the treaty will be signed.

254
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:42,000
What negotiations?
What treaty?

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,625
Sorry.

256
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,333
I'll start at the beginning...

257
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,041
which is four years ago.

258
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,125
A Romulan battle cruiser

259
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,917
strayed into
Federation space.

260
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,750
Its warp coils
had collapsed.

261
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,834
Life support was failing.

262
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,291
TROI:
You saved them, Will.

263
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,709
You and the<i> Enterprise.</i>

264
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:02,500
The Romulans
were... impressed

265
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,083
to say the least.

266
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,542
After years of distrust
and conflict

267
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,792
they started to talk.

268
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:12,125
You were our key spokesman

269
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,000
in securing the alliance
with the Romulans.

270
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,792
How far have
these negotiations progressed?

271
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:18,375
The preliminaries are over.

272
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,375
All we need do now is escort
the Romulan Ambassador

273
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,625
to the final session.

274
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,667
Where you will complete
the negotiations

275
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,000
and sign the treaty.

276
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,000
Captain...

277
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,291
Admiral

278
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,000
I am in no condition
to negotiate with the Romulans

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,500
or with anyone else.

280
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,667
Will, you're sound
of mind and body.

281
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,291
If you are properly briefed

282
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,959
you'll still be able
to fulfill your duty.

283
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,291
With a 16-year gap in my head?

284
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,291
We do need<i> you.</i>

285
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,333
Sir... I'm not fit

286
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,625
to resume command.

287
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,458
I appreciate your candor

288
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,875
but despite your condition,
there is no one better equipped

289
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,291
to deal with the Romulans
than you.

290
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,166
When do we leave?

291
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,083
As soon as the Ambassador
transports over from the<i> Decius.</i>

292
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,166
We will get through this...

293
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,417
as we have many times before.

294
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,834
I hope so.

295
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:33,291
Let me take you
to your quarters.

296
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,792
Good idea.

297
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:37,000
I've had enough surprises
for one day.

298
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,041
Anything familiar?

299
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,458
(<i> trombone playing</i>
<i>"Three Blind Mice" badly</i> )

300
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,041
Hi, Dad.

301
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:11,667
...and then Mr. Greenburg
asked about the Fornax Disaster

302
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:14,458
and I knew the<i> Enterprise</i>
saved all the colonists

303
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,834
but I didn't know...

304
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:20,625
Ah, here it is.

305
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,834
But I didn't know
the exact stardate

306
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,500
of when their sun went nova.

307
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,417
So if you tell it to me,
I'll write it down

308
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:31,041
and that way
I won't forget.

309
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:39,208
You don't remember me, do you?

310
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,250
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,709
TROI:
I need to talk to
your father, Jean-Luc.

312
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:47,875
Would you mind
leaving us alone

313
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,208
just for a moment?

314
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,375
Why didn't you warn me?

315
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,458
Beverly hoped that
meeting him like this

316
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,291
might make an impact--
help you remember.

317
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,875
Well, it made an impact,
all right.

318
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,583
Give it time.

319
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,375
Jean-Luc.

320
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,709
Yes.

321
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,750
The Admiral was very pleased
when you chose that name.

322
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,667
He's a wonderful boy.

323
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,458
Deanna...

324
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,542
who's his mother?

325
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,917
She died two years ago.

326
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,000
A shuttle accident.

327
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,041
I'm sorry, Will.

328
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,583
I have no recollection
of her at all.

329
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,041
What was she like?

330
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:17,083
Min was beautiful

331
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,375
of course.

332
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,458
Strong,

333
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,792
intelligent, patient.

334
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:26,542
Well, she was married to me.

335
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:28,125
She had to be patient.

336
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:32,125
She was
an excellent Captain's wife

337
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,291
and a very good
ship's counselor.

338
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,166
She took over after I left.

339
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,792
I can't imagine
you leaving the<i> Enterprise.</i>

340
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,417
Admiral Picard
offered me a position

341
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,417
at Starfleet Command.

342
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,917
It was a tremendous opportunity.

343
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,959
I couldn't refuse.

344
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:59,625
But what's important
right now,

345
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,875
today

346
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:04,166
is that you have a son
who needs you.

347
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,458
Spend time with him.

348
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,834
You may find part
of what you've lost.

349
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,125
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

350
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,959
(<i> trombone playing</i>
<i>off-key scale</i> )

351
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,083
Pretty bad, huh?

352
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,375
I've heard better.

353
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,709
I've been practicing
but I...

354
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,291
I still
can't get a good tone.

355
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,917
You're putting too much
pressure on the mouthpiece.

356
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,125
Relax the embouchure.

357
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,208
Don't use any muscles
you don't need.

358
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,542
Show me again.

359
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,542
Left hand, right hand.

360
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:57,375
(<i> playing scale</i> )

361
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:01,458
(<i> playing "Misty"</i> )

362
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,000
(<i> plays flat note</i> )

363
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,125
(<i> chuckles</i> )

364
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,542
16 years, you'd think
I'd be able to hit that note.

365
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,667
Come on, Dad.

366
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,083
You always make
that mistake.

367
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,542
Computer, summarize
service record

368
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:23,291
Riker, William T., Captain.

369
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,959
Begin with the Fornax Disaster.

370
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,375
Please restate question.

371
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,041
Service record,
Riker, William T.

372
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,208
(<i> strained beeping</i> )

373
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,166
Damn it.

374
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,291
Dad?

375
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,792
Computer lag.

376
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:41,250
I can't believe Geordi's
still running his diagnostic.

377
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,750
Is, um, that
what you wanted?

378
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,792
Picard to Captain Riker.

379
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:50,250
The Romulan Ambassador

380
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,583
is ready to transport
over from the<i> Decius.</i>

381
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,291
On my way.

382
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,417
I've got to go.

383
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:57,000
Sure.

384
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,083
Dad?

385
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,333
Everything's going to be fine.

386
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,792
Thanks.
Bye.

387
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,375
Troi tells me
you met Jean-Luc.

388
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,625
How is my namesake
holding up to all this?

389
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,375
Better than I am.

390
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,709
We did our best
to prepare him.

391
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,500
I'm trying to catch up
with all this.

392
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,875
I've still got
a long way to go--

393
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,208
a<i> long</i> way.

394
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,834
Just follow my lead
with the Ambassador.

395
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,041
You'll be fine.

396
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,458
The<i> Decius</i> reports

397
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,417
the Ambassador is
waiting to transport.

398
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:29,166
Beam him aboard.

399
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,625
Admiral Picard,
Captain Riker.

400
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,250
It's good
to see you again.

401
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,667
Ambassador Tomalak

402
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,709
welcome aboard
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

403
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:45,875
Thank you, Admiral.

404
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,583
It is an honor
to be the first Romulan

405
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,500
to freely walk
about a Federation starship.

406
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,458
<i>Ambassador</i> Tomalak?

407
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,709
At Nelvana III,
he threatened

408
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,583
to take the hull
of the<i> Enterprise</i> home

409
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,083
as a war trophy.

410
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,083
That was a long time ago.

411
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:09,709
Many things have changed,
including Tomalak.

412
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,417
TOMALAK:
As soon as we arrive
at your Outpost 23

413
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,333
the final negotiations
should go quickly.

414
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,792
I agree, Ambassador.

415
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:20,583
All of the difficult issues
have been resolved.

416
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,083
After much debate.

417
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,834
Your Captain Riker
is the kind of negotiator

418
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,959
even the Ferengi
should avoid.

419
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,291
But we have come
to an agreement

420
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,542
both sides
are happy with.

421
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,667
Largely thanks
to Captain Riker.

422
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,542
And we are grateful,
Captain.

423
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:36,333
The new alliance
will greatly benefit my people.

424
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,333
As I hope it will
benefit mine.

425
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,291
Oh, it will,
Captain, it will.

426
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:49,709
Main Bridge.

427
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:51,583
The virus you
contracted, Captain--

428
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,917
have you fully recovered?

429
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:55,583
I assure you, Captain
Riker is quite well.

430
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,792
He is looking
forward to attending

431
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,959
the final negotiations as
planned.

432
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,709
Excellent.

433
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:04,709
The signing of this treaty
is an historic occasion.

434
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:07,709
You, of all people,
deserve to be there.

435
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:10,125
Thank you... Ambassador.

436
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,709
So this is the Bridge
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

437
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,542
And this, I assume
is your tactical position?

438
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:25,667
Impressive.

439
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,375
RIKER:
Excuse me.

440
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,542
Admiral, Deanna

441
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:29,875
I need a moment
with you.

442
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,208
Commander Data,
if you would

443
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,625
accompany the Ambassador
on his... tour?

444
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,667
Certainly, sir.

445
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,000
Excuse us, Ambassador.

446
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,750
Ambassador, you may find
this of interest.

447
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,250
These newly
refined sensors

448
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,750
are capable of pinpointing
power emissions

449
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,583
of a cloaked warbird
even at warp.

450
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,959
You say you trust Tomalak?

451
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:53,125
I trust the process

452
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,500
we have built
with the Romulans

453
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,625
over the past four years.

454
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,041
They have nothing
to gain by betrayal.

455
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,667
Are you sure?

456
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,166
You've always said it's
a chess game with the Romulans--

457
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:04,834
move, countermove,
guile and deceit.

458
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:08,000
I sense no such dishonesty
in Tomalak.

459
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,583
His desire for peace
is sincere.

460
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,625
He wants this alliance.

461
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,000
There's no cause
for concern.

462
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,792
No cause for concern?

463
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:20,166
We're talking about revealing
the location of Outpost 23--

464
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:23,333
the key to all of our defenses
in the Neutral Zone.

465
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:27,250
I'm sorry, Will.
Your information is out of date.

466
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,709
The strategic importance
of Outpost 23 is minimal.

467
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:33,959
Has been for years.

468
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,458
Dr. Crusher to Riker.

469
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,709
Are you there, Captain?

470
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:37,750
What is it, Doctor?

471
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,166
Your son has been injured.

472
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,750
He's been taken to Sick Bay.

473
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,417
You'd better come down here
right away.

474
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,000
Dad.

475
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,208
Are you all right?

476
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,333
I'm fine.

477
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:54,375
What happened?

478
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,208
It's broken

479
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,792
but it's going to be all
right in just a minute.

480
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,542
Now, let's go easy
on this arm

481
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,750
for a little while, okay?

482
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,667
How did this happen?

483
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,959
I was in the gym...

484
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,208
playing parrises squares.

485
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,917
Parrises squares?

486
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:13,166
I fell off the ramp.

487
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,250
At your age, you could
break your neck!

488
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,417
I'm sorry.

489
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,291
I didn't mean to.

490
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,917
Continue the
compression attenuator

491
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:21,917
for another two minutes.

492
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:23,083
Yes, Doctor.

493
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,917
Can I talk to you
for a moment?

494
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,291
I'll be right back.

495
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,875
Will, how old were you

496
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:34,709
when you first started
playing parrises squares?

497
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:37,959
All right. I was probably
a little younger than he is.

498
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:41,166
It's just that, for
all practical purposes

499
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,166
this is my first day
as a father

500
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,291
and he almost kills himself.

501
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,375
He didn't almost
kill himself.

502
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,959
He just broke his wrist.

503
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,917
Just like a lot
of other boys his age

504
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,250
when they fall.

505
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:53,625
You're right.

506
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,875
It's difficult.

507
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,250
Difficult for you.

508
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,333
What about for Jean-Luc?

509
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,000
Can you imagine
how he feels?

510
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,750
You've lost 16 years.

511
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,083
Jean-Luc has lost
a lot more than that.

512
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:09,500
First, his mother...

513
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,917
and now, his father.

514
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,375
Good as new, Captain.

515
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:19,542
You can take
him home.

516
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:21,500
Thanks.

517
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,750
How's the arm?

518
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,792
It's fine.

519
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,000
Dad, I'm really sorry.

520
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,458
I mean, I know you have
more important

521
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:29,917
things to do...

522
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,375
There is nothing more
important than this, son.

523
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,959
Captain.

524
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:41,875
Deck eight.

525
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,208
Halt.

526
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,417
I know how hard
this is for you.

527
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:48,417
It's okay, Dad.

528
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:50,000
No, okay is not
good enough.

529
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,959
When I was your age

530
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:55,458
my own father
wasn't there for me

531
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:57,417
and I really needed him.

532
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:59,709
I've often wondered
what kind of father I'd be.

533
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,542
I never felt quite ready.

534
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,166
The idea even scared me
a little.

535
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,542
Scared?

536
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:10,417
You?

537
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,792
Yeah.

538
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,667
But I guess I got over it--
you're here.

539
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:18,125
Resume.

540
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,667
It's important to me

541
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:25,291
that I don't
let you down, Jean-Luc.

542
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,417
You never have, Dad.

543
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,000
You've always
been there for me.

544
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,792
I'll have to take
your word for that

545
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:35,625
because I don't
remember any of it--

546
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:39,291
your first step,
your first tooth, nothing.

547
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,875
And I want to remember.

548
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:54,917
I guess there's
only one thing we can do.

549
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:57,166
We've got to build
some new memories.

550
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,583
(<i> door opens</i> )

551
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:02,125
I'm not sure it's still
in the memory banks

552
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:03,792
but I used to have
a great fishing program

553
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:04,875
on the holodeck.

554
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,125
The Curtis Creek program?

555
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,500
You know it.

556
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,291
Sure, we've gone
to Curtis Creek
lots of times.

557
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:12,083
Would you like
to go again?
You bet.

558
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:13,875
Well, as soon as
these negotiations
are out of the way

559
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,375
you and I are
going fishing.

560
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,709
Great.

561
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,166
...and then Mom tried
to net the fish

562
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,000
and she fell
in the creek, too.

563
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,542
And then you tried
to pull us both out

564
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:26,542
and you fell in.

565
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:28,583
I'm not sure
I want to remember that.

566
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,000
Mom really liked
Curtis Creek.

567
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,333
We went there
for picnics

568
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,375
and stuff lots of times.

569
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,375
What was she like?

570
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:43,166
She was great.

571
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:44,500
I think of her a lot.

572
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,208
I better go change.

573
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,709

RIKER:
Damn!

580
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:44,875
What's wrong, Dad?

581
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:47,291
The computer still
isn't working properly.

582
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,709
I can't bring up a
visual of your mother.

583
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:51,875
But I know Mom's pictures
are in there.

584
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,917
Did you give a stardate?

585
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,250

591
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,959
Minuet.

592
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,542
Mom was beautiful,
wasn't she?

593
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:39,291
Yes.

594
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:40,709
(<i> console beeping</i> )

595
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,250
What's wrong, Dad?

596
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,667
La Forge to Riker.

597
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:46,000
Riker here.

598
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,500
Captain, please come
to the Bridge.

599
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,875
On my way.

600
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,083
What's the problem?

601
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,375
I've had to shut down
the warp engines, Captain.

602
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,834
Why?

603
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:59,917
Antimatter containment
fields are fluctuating.

604
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,291
It's nothing to worry
about though.

605
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:02,667
We're on the edge
of the Neutral Zone

606
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:04,709
at impulse power,
and you're not concerned?

607
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:06,709
I'll have the engines
back on line in no time.

608
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:09,750
Like you tracked
down that faulty
processing accelerator?

609
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,083
I'm running
a level-1 diagnostic.

610
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,250
For 30 hours?

611
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,208
It would never
take you more than four.

612
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:19,125
You're incapable of that level
of incompetence, Mr. La Forge.

613
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:23,041
Worf, where did you get
that scar?

614
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:24,709
In combat.

615
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:26,500
What battle?

616
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,875
When?

617
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,583
Which sector?

618
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:31,750
Which unit?

619
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,166
Mr. Data, if we
left immediately

620
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:36,750
when would we arrive
at Outpost 23?

621
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:40,000
At warp one
three days, four hours...

622
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,417
What about
at warp seven?

623
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,750
At warp eight?

624
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,667
At warp nine?
What's the matter, Data?

625
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:47,792
What happened to
those millions

626
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:50,041
of calculations
per second?

627
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,250
Pardon me, sir.

628
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,125
I am experiencing
subspace interference

629
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,041
which limits my abilities.

630
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,208
I can't operate as quickly as...

631
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:57,250
What did you say?

632
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,542
I said I cannot operate...

633
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,000
No, that's not what you said.

634
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,208
You said, "I can't."

635
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:02,667
You used a contraction,
didn't you?

636
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,500
Sir, I can explain
if you would just give me...

637
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,792
No, you can't.
Don't even try.

638
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,208
Captain, perhaps
it would be best

639
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,333
if we
discussed this...

640
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,625
Shut up!

641
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:15,583
I beg your pardon?

642
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,417
I said shut up

643
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:19,792
as in close your mouth
and stop talking.

644
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:23,041
Will, I sense
how upset you are.

645
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,625
You're angry
and impatient...

646
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,917
Deanna, back off.

647
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:30,709
Well, would anyone else

648
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:34,834
like to speak up
or shall we end this charade?

649
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,375
As you wish, Commander Riker.

650
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,667
The charade is over.

651
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:05,583
The<i> Enterprise,</i> my son--

652
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,750
you created it all.

653
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,875
With the help
of our neural scanners

654
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:10,917
and what you would
call a holodeck.

655
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,625
Now, please tell me.

656
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,375
How did you discover
the truth?

657
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,208
The future
we created for you

658
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:19,583
should have been
convincing.

659
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:20,917
It wasn't.

660
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:23,709
There was a computer
time lag, for one thing.

661
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:25,208
Unavoidable.

662
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,333
Our scanners have
a limited response time

663
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:30,750
so whenever you strayed
from our... expectations...

664
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,917
But surely, that was
not enough to...

665
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:36,834
To smash your
house of cards?

666
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:39,834
No, it was
the visual record

667
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:42,583
of my "wife," Minuet.

668
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,709
Bad move.

669
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:47,750
But we chose someone from
your past who is still alive

670
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,792
a woman you were
extremely attracted to.

671
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:51,583
Your mistake, Tomalak.

672
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:55,125
Minuet was nothing more than
a computer-generated fantasy

673
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,959
I once experienced
on another holodeck.

674
00:33:57,959 --> 00:34:00,792
Impossible.

675
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:03,667
In your mind, that woman
exists physically.

676
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,083
Your feelings toward her
remain quite passionate.

677
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,000
She was part of a
very special program.

678
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,458
(<i> sighs</i> )

679
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:17,208
So much effort,
so little accomplished.

680
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,875
If it was Outpost 23
you were after

681
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,500
why didn't you use
your neural scanners

682
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,083
to probe my mind?

683
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,291
Our scanners
are calibrated

684
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,000
for Romulan
brain patterns.

685
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,417
When it comes to human brains,
they are less efficient.

686
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:31,959
There were gaps
in the information

687
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:33,250
we gathered
from your memory.

688
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,542
Gaps?

689
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,667
From what I saw, I find
that hard to believe.

690
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:42,959
You recreated
the<i> Enterprise--</i>

691
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,208
the crew,

692
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:48,000
every nuance,
smell, sound--

693
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
with perfect accuracy.

694
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,166
I didn't see any gaps.

695
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:55,709
I don't buy it, Tomalak.

696
00:34:57,709 --> 00:35:00,083
We are wasting time.

697
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:04,792
Bring him!

698
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:09,208
(<i> door opens</i> )

699
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,959
When you and your colleagues
transported to this planet

700
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:15,208
you were less than
a kilometer from this base.

701
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,709
Your capture was
a simple matter.

702
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:18,500
My colleagues,
where are they?

703
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,583
We allowed them to
transport safely back
to the<i> Enterprise</i>

704
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,208
but your signal
was diverted.

705
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,333
They won't stop
looking for me, Tomalak.

706
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,750
They already have.

707
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,667
Please, say hello to your son.

708
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,583
Jean-Luc?

709
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:39,959
That is not his name,
of course

710
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,875
nor have you ever
really met him.

711
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:45,208
We merely used his image
to augment your program.

712
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,917
What have you
done to him?

713
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,375
While I am gone,
please give

714
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,667
careful thought
to your situation.

715
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,375
What's your name?

716
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,250
Whoa!

717
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,375
If we're going
to get out of here

718
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:16,792
you're going to have
to trust me.

719
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,709
Easy. I'm not
going to hurt you.

720
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,125
Who are you?

721
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,208
How did you get here?

722
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:30,834
My name is Will.

723
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,291
Ethan.

724
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:40,458
They brought me here
with my parents.

725
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:43,333
We were at a research
station at Miridian VI.

726
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,583
Miridian VI?

727
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,125
On the edge
of the Neutral Zone.

728
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,500
I thought
that was uninhabited.

729
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,750
The station was
set up last year.

730
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,250
Then the Romulans came.

731
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:59,125
It's odd that
the<i> Enterprise</i> 
wasn't advised.

732
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:04,625
Where are
your parents now?

733
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,458
They took them away.

734
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,959
Do you know why the Romulans
are keeping you here?

735
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:12,875
No.

736
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,166
I just want to get away.

737
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:19,208
I'll get us
out of here, Ethan.

738
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,875
How?

739
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:24,000
Even if we
do get away

740
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,834
they'll find us.

741
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:28,083
They found me
when I escaped before.

742
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,333
You escaped?

743
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,458
Yes.

744
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:33,208
I hid in a secret place
for weeks.

745
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,625
They caught me when
I came out to find food.

746
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,333
I want that information,
Commander.

747
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:45,583
I want the location
of Outpost 23.

748
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:48,250
Very well, I have
been given permission

749
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,917
to use whatever means
are necessary.

750
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,166
Ethan, no!

751
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,458
Stop him!

752
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:56,750
(<i> grunts</i> )

753
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,000
That secret
hiding place of yours?

754
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,792
This way!

755
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:11,000
In here!

756
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,250
(<i> scanner beeping</i> )

757
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:55,000
Their sensors
should have picked us up.

758
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,250
No, they can't.

759
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,458
I heard them.

760
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:59,000
There's something
in these rocks.

761
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,083
Heavy metals?

762
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,625
Right.

763
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,375
The Romulans forgot
all about this storeroom

764
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,166
when they rebuilt their tunnels.

765
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,166
Here, we can use these.

766
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:17,750
Help me.

767
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:30,041
After I escaped
last time

768
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,583
I mapped out
all their tunnels.

769
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,208
Supply depot.
Mm-hmm.

770
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,500
Communications

771
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,125
living quarters
and shuttle bay.

772
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,166
How many guards
in the shuttle bay?

773
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,500
Only two or three.

774
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:49,041
If we stole a shuttlecraft,
that would get us nowhere

775
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:51,166
because the Romulans
could follow their own ship

776
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,709
too easily.

777
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:56,458
But if we broke into

778
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,792
their communications system

779
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:01,542
we could send a message
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

780
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:02,875
Can't do that.

781
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:05,125
The transmitter
is on a voice-activated

782
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:06,542
security system only.

783
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,542
Do you know whose voice
activates it?

784
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:10,583
Only Ambassador Tomalak.

785
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,667
Who?

786
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,000
Tomalak.

787
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,375
<i>Ambassador</i> Tomalak?

788
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,583
Tomalak is a Romulan Captain.

789
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,417
The only time
he was ever called Ambassador

790
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:25,208
was in a holodeck fantasy.

791
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,792
How do you
know about that?

792
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,500
You, uh... you
told me about him.

793
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,583
Who are you?

794
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:35,250
What is your part
in all this?

795
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,458
(<i> clattering, distant voices</i> )

796
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,041
They've found us!

797
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:42,542
But you said the sensors
didn't work in these tunnels.

798
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:43,959
Uh, they must
have fixed them.

799
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:45,291
We've got to go.

800
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:46,750
Where are we going
to go, Ethan?

801
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,709
The shuttle bay.

802
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:48,709
There's still time.

803
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,500
No, I've had enough.

804
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:54,500
Commander, surrender
your weapon.

805
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,041
No more games.

806
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:00,792
No more fantasies.

807
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,208
I'm not going to play anymore.

808
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:15,667
It was never the Romulans.

809
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:17,208
It was you all along, wasn't it?

810
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,834
There is no question
about it, sir.

811
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:28,166
It is his signal.

812
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,542
Picard to Commander Riker,
do you read me?

813
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:33,333
Riker to Picard, I'm here.

814
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:34,417
Are you all right?

815
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:35,709
Yes, sir, I'm all right.

816
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:37,166
What about Geordi and Worf?

817
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:39,417
We beamed them up an hour ago.
They're fine.

818
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:41,458
But we lost you
in mid-transport.

819
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:42,625
Where have you been?

820
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,875
What is going on down there?

821
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:45,500
I'm not sure yet, sir.

822
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,875
But I think I'm
about to find out.

823
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,792
Stand by.

824
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,375
What shall I call you?

825
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:06,667
Ethan? Jean-Luc?

826
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,959
Doesn't matter.

827
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,709
This room, it's more
than a holodeck, isn't it?

828
00:42:12,709 --> 00:42:14,083
Much more.

829
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:16,709
The neural scanners
read my mind.

830
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:18,750
Give me anything I want--

831
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,125
just like they tried
to give you everything
you wanted.

832
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,041
Everything<i> I</i> wanted?!

833
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,959
<i>You</i> probed the<i> Enterprise.</i>

834
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,125
You lured us here so you
could play games with me.

835
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,709
<i>I</i> didn't want
that, you did.

836
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:30,667
Why?

837
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,834
My world was invaded.

838
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:35,625
My people, killed.

839
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:36,834
My mother brought me here

840
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:39,750
so our enemies
would never find me.

841
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:47,709
They found her, didn't they?

842
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,917
She knew that they
would never stop

843
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:56,000
looking for her...

844
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,542
so she made sure
I would be safe.

845

(<i> whirring pulses</i> )

846
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:10,875
She left the scanners
to protect me--

847
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:13,291
to give me
anything I wanted.

848
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,125
Anything?

849
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,709
Then why did you kidnap me?

850
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:18,041
I wanted you to stay.

851
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:21,625
It's been so long.

00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:33,458
I'm sorry.
