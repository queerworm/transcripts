00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:05,417
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46682.4.</i>

2
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:08,458
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is docked</i>
<i>at the Remmler Array,</i>

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,291
<i>where it will undergo</i>
<i>a routine procedure</i>

4
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,750
<i>to eliminate accumulated</i>
<i>baryon particles.</i>

5
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:16,917
<i>In preparation for the sweep,</i>
<i>we are evacuating the ship.</i>

6
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:20,667
Attention, personnel
on decks 14 and 15.

7
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:23,333
Your transporter room
assignment has been changed.

8
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,125
Report
to transporter room three.

9
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:29,375
Captain, we're still
behind schedule on
decks seven and eight.

10
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:31,875
Shall I tell Arkaria Base
there'll be a delay?

11
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:34,792
No. Open up the transporters
on Cargo Bay Two

12
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,333
and divert everyone
from deck seven to there.

13
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,333
That should put us
back on track.
Right.

14
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,875
All beta shift
engineering personnel

15
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,542
are requested to report
to main engineering...

16
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,750
Captain, the Arkaria Base
does not have

17
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:47,625
the medical storage units
I requested.

18
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:49,417
I have seven
living tissue samples

19
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,625
that won't survive
the baryon sweep

20
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:51,709
any more than
you and I would.

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,000
I've tried to
reason with them.

22
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,667
All right, uh, have
Commander La Forge

23
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:57,583
transport a stasis unit
from the astrophysics lab.

24
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,083
You should be able
to convert it to
store tissue samples.

25
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,875
Thank you, Captain.

26
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:06,125
All science personnel,
please check in with
your section chief

27
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,041
for a station-side
duty assignment.

28
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,375
Captain. I'm heading
to deck seven.

29
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:12,208
I've put the auto-shutdown
sequence on hold

30
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,500
until we get back
on schedule.

31
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:15,208
Oh, I think we can
resume the sequence.

32
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,250
Counselor Troi is
taking care of the
situation on deck seven.

33
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,542
Aye, sir.

34
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:21,792
Captain.

35
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,291
Bridge.

36
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:32,500
It has been quite
a day, has it not?

37
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,458
Yes, it has.

38
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,542
However, a change
of routine is often
invigorating

39
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:44,792
and can be a welcome
diversion after
a long assignment.

40
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,000
Exactly.

41
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:54,083
I understand that Arkaria
has some very interesting
weather patterns.

42
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,667
Mr. Data,
are you all right?

43
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,667
Yes, sir.
I am attempting to fill

44
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:02,542
a silent moment with
nonrelevant conversation.

45
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:08,000
Ah. Small talk.
Yes, sir.

46
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:12,500
I have found that humans
often use "small talk"
during awkward moments.

47
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:16,583
Therefore, I have
written a new subroutine
for that purpose.

48
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,458
How did I do?

49
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,709
Perhaps it was a little...
<i>too</i> nonrelevant,

50
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,458
but if you really are
interested in small talk,

51
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,166
then you should keep your
eye on Commander Hutchinson

52
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,083
at the reception
this afternoon.

53
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,166
He's a master.

54
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,834
Hmm. Thank you,
sir. I will.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,625
LA FORGE:
Captain.
WORF:
Captain.

56
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:46,291
(<i> both talking</i> )

57
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,250
After you, sir.
No, after you.

58
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,083
No, sir. I believe
you spoke first.

59
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,959
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
we're running of time.
Mr. Worf?

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,834
The computer needs
your authorization

61
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,542
to disable command functions
during the baryon sweep.

62
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,500
Are we ready,
Commander La Forge?

63
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:01,583
Almost. I've requested two
additional field diverters,

64
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,959
one for the computer core,
one for the bridge.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,959
They haven't been
installed yet.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,333
Additional units?

67
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,041
Yes, sir. We've logged,
in five years,

68
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,166
more warp hours than
most ships do in ten,

69
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,041
so our baryon particle
levels are high.

70
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,375
I'm a little concerned
that when the Remmler Array

71
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:16,709
starts to sweep the ship,

72
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,583
it'll have to use
a stronger beam than normal

73
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,125
in order to get rid
of all the radiation.

74
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,834
And that might overload
the field converters

75
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,166
protecting our key systems.

76
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,291
How long until the
new ones are in place?

77
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,500
I'd say about 20 minutes.

78
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,709
Very well.

79
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,208
Computer, disable
all command functions
in 30 minutes.

80
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,000
Authorization: Picard
gamma-six-zero-seven-three.

81
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,917
Authorization
acknowledged.

82
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,959
Captain.
Incoming message.

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's the station
administrator, Mr. Orton.

84
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,500
In my ready room,
Mr. Worf.

85
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,000
And, Captain, request
permission to be excused

86
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:53,166
from Commander Hutchinson's
reception.

87
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,500
Permission granted.

88
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:57,041
I wish I could
excuse myself as well.

89
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,500
Captain, permission...

90
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,083
Mr. La Forge,
I cannot excuse

91
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,083
my entire senior staff.

92
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,875
Mr. Worf beat you to it.

93
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,166
Go ahead, Mr. Orton.

94
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,333
Captain, if you're
on schedule, I'd
like to confirm

95
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,291
that we'll begin
the baryon sweep
at 1500 hours--

96
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,291
approximately
one hour from now.
Confirmed.

97
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,250
Commander Hutchinson
also wanted me to make sure

98
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,375
that you'll be able to attend
his reception this afternoon.

99
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,750
Tell him I'm
looking forward to it.

100
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:38,959
He'll be delighted
to hear that.

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,208
Arkaria base out.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,291
(<i> sighs</i> )

103
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,333
Tell Arkaria Base we're
almost finished here.

104
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,125
MAN:
We're going to need
two more conduits.

105
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,709
WOMAN:
I need to run a diagnostic
on the diverter.

106
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,041
Get the diverter aligned
so we can begin
the isolation procedure.

107
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,125
Where's the ODN
interface?

108
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:22,500
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

109
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:26,750
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

110
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:28,625
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

111
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:32,166
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

112
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:36,583
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

113
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:41,500
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

114
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,291
(<i> soft music playing</i> )

115
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,750
RIKER:
Your Remmler Array
is considered...

116
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:48,166
MAN 1:
Here you are.

117
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,417
MAN 2:
That's nice to hear.

118
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,875
RIKER:
What are these?

119
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,500
MAN 2:
Briskian cheese pastries.

120
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:54,333
TROI:
Geordi, would you get me
some more fruit salad?

121
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:58,041
Beverly, lovely as ever.

122
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,125
How do you manage it?

123
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,166
It's good
to see you again.

124
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,125
It's been far too long.

125
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,375
What is it, four years?

126
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:04,250
Now, I want to hear
about everything

127
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,750
that happened after you
left Starfleet medical.

128
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:09,166
And I have so much
to tell<i> you.</i>

129
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,959
Oh, that must be
Commander Riker.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Excuse me.

131
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,667
Of course.

132
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,500
Pardon me.

133
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,208
You must be Will Riker.

134
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,458
I must be.

135
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,834
Calvin Hutchinson.
Call me Hutch.

136
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,166
Calvin-- awful name.
I've never forgiven
my parents.

137
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,917
Soon as I saw you,
I knew you had to be

138
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,625
the<i> Enterprise's</i>
first officer.

139
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:35,959
Oh?
Oh, of course.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,041
Your reputation
precedes you--

141
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,333
flashing blue eyes,
square jaw--

142
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,959
quite the ladies' man,
I hear.

143
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,083
Now, don't be
modest, Will.

144
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,125
Oh, may I
call you "Will"?

145
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,250
Uh, sure.

146
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,208
I also hear that
you're a musician.

147
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,542
I certainly hope you'll
play something for us.

148
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,250
It's not often
we get to entertain

149
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,208
the command crew
of the flagship.

150
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,458
Oh, and speaking
of command.

151
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,458
Hello, Captain Picard.

152
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,625
Commander.

153
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,125
I was just telling
your first officer

154
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,792
what a real pleasure
it is to have
all of you here.

155
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:08,875
So how are you, anyway?

156
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:10,166
Very well.
Thank you.

157
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,709
What have
you been up to?

158
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,291
It is very good
to see you both again.

159
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,667
Beverly...

160
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:18,625
may I call
you "Beverly"?

161
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:22,959
Beverly, have you noticed
that the mean temperature
here on Arkaria

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,959
is slightly higher
than normal for
human comfort levels?

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,083
I have found that humans
prefer a body temperature
of 21 degrees Celsius

164
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,750
in order to operate
most efficiently.

165
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:36,291
However, there<i> are</i>
several cultures

166
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,458
who actually prefer that
their body temperature

167
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,875
is identical to the
temperature of the room
in which they are standing.

168
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:42,959
(<i> chuckling</i> )

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,625
The Sheliak,
for example...

170
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,959
I am telling you,
you have never seen
anything like this.

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,875
There were thousands
of these creatures.

172
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:52,000
The whole northern sky
turned dark.

173
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,875
Oh, uh, Geordi...
Deanna.

174
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:56,834
I don't think you
have met our host.

175
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,875
This is Lieutenant
Commander Geordi La Forge.

176
00:09:58,917 --> 00:09:59,917
Hello.
Hi.

177
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:01,166
Counselor Deanna Troi.

178
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,375
This is
Commander Hutchinson.

179
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,208
Oh, please,
call me Hutch.
Hello.

180
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,875
I was just telling
your captain here

181
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:08,458
about some of the more
fascinating sights
here in Arkaria.

182
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,834
Either of you interested
in ornithology?

183
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,583
Uh, well...
The mating habits

184
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,917
of the Arkarian horn fowl
are quite interesting.

185
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,125
If the weather were better,
we could take horses

186
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,959
to the southern
promontory and visit
the nesting grounds.

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,041
Horses?
Yes.

188
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,375
We have a network of trails
through the plains.

189
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:29,166
Unfortunately, it's not
very pleasant right now--
cold, muddy.

190
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,166
Not a soul
for kilometers.

191
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,625
Sounds perfect.

192
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,667
Mr. La Forge, how long
before the baryon sweep

193
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,959
begins on the<i> Enterprise?</i> 
About 25 minutes, sir.

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,083
Then I have enough time
to go back to the ship
and get my saddle.

195
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,417
TROI:
Your saddle?

196
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,583
Yes. A saddle is
a very personal thing.

197
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:49,583
It has to be, uh,
broken in, used, cared for.

198
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,959
You keep a saddle
onboard the<i> Enterprise?</i>

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,750
Oh, yes, yes.

200
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,875
I never know
when I will have
the opportunity to ride.

201
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:57,875
I see.
It's perfectly normal.

202
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:01,208
You know, most
serious riders do have
their own saddles.

203
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,583
Of course.
Absolutely.

204
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,750
Well, if you
will excuse me.

205
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,709
Amazing man.

206
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,125
You know, he reminds me
of another officer

207
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,333
I knew years ago--
a Captain Edwell.

208
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,792
Now,<i> he</i> was fascinating.
Born on Gaspar VII,

209
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,291
but you wouldn't know it
from the way he looked.

210
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:27,083
COMPUTER:
Auto-shutdown sequence
in progress.

211
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,291
Defensive systems
off-line.

212
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,458
Baryon sweep begins
in eight minutes.

213
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,250
MAN:
What are you doing?

214
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:55,709
Someone left this ODN
junction box open.

215
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,834
I thought your crew
was supposed to be
off the ship

216
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,667
once the field diverters
were in place.

217
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:02,875
The diverters
have to be synchronized.

218
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:05,875
I was laser bonding
a backup link.

219
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:08,333
I see.

220
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,291
Well, I better
let you finish up

221
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,166
so that you
can get off the ship.

222
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,875
Excuse me a minute.

223
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,583
Auto-shutdown sequence
in progress.

224
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:37,375
Primary power off-line
in one minute.

225
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,875
WOMAN:
We still need to bypass

226
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,291
the magnetic
containment conduit.

227
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,083
MAN:
That should be down
on deck 30.

228
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,709
Well, then get Pomet
started on it right away.

229
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:58,667
Primary power off-line
in 30 seconds.

230
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,750
Final warning.

231
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:11,458
Primary power off-line
in ten seconds.

232
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:48,667
Hmm... yes.
I find it fascinating

233
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:52,500
that your family chose
to drop the prefix "Pel"
from your surname.

234
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,083
It was my understanding
that "Pel Orton"

235
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,166
is a more noble appellation
than simply "Orton."

236
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,083
Yes.
Hmm.

237
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,959
Perhaps the recent
Arkarian trend toward

238
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,083
a more egalitarian society
is partly responsible, huh?

239
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,917
Perhaps.

240
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,291
The crew of the<i> Magellan</i>

241
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,542
actually put on
a talent show here.

242
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:16,458
Captain Conklin
did a poetry reading,
if you can imagine that.

243
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,792
I'm trying to.
Did I ever tell you

244
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,250
how I happened
to be stationed here?

245
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,625
It's a fascinating story.

246
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:23,041
I was serving on
Admiral Mitchell's staff

247
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,834
on Starbase 97--
awful place, by the way.

248
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,875
Have you met
our Commander Data?
Hmm?

249
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:31,166
...as a matter of fact,
I find it oddly amusing.

250
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,375
(<i> laughs loudly</i> )

251
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:33,834
No, I don't think so.

252
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,375
Come on,
I'll introduce you.

253
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,417
DATA:
There are several
cultures in this sector

254
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,250
with extremely similar
etymological histories.
For example...

255
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,375
Mr. Data, I don't know
if you've had a chance meet

256
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:44,875
our host,
Commander Hutchinson.

257
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,333
"Call me Hutch."
"Call me Hutch."

258
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,125
Lieutenant Commander Data,
our second officer.

259
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,208
A pleasure.

260
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,709
The pleasure
is mine... Hutch.

261
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,125
I've been meaning
to compliment you

262
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,500
on your choice
of colors here.

263
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:56,583
Oh, you really
think so, hmm?

264
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,375
Well, it wasn't easy
making a final decision,
let me tell you.

265
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,583
I can well imagine.
The light in this room

266
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,083
would make color selection
exceptionally problematic.

267
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,250
Precisely.

268
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,667
(<i> both laughing</i> )

269
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:08,625
Thank you.

270
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:09,959
You're welcome.

271
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,709
I'm not sure which one
to feel sorry for.

272
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,417
Mr. Orton?

273
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,625
You'll excuse me,
Commander?

274
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,291
Geordi, what happened
to the captain?

275
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,875
Oh, he went back
to the ship to
get his saddle.

276
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:23,208
His saddle?

277
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,458
Any serious rider
would have his own saddle.

278
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh.

279
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,875
He probably went
straight to the stables.

280
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:30,709
I bet he's ten kilometers
from here already.

281
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,583
Lucky him.

282
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,375
Thank you.

283
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,166
Kelsey to Devor.

284
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,083
Kelsey to Devor.

285
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,291
Devor, this is Kelsey.
Reply.

286
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,125
Devor, do you read me?

287
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,250
Kelsey to Kiros.
This is Kiros.

288
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,041
KELSEY:
Devor isn't responding.

289
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,875
There must be
too much interference
from the baryon sweep.

290
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:32,291
Go find him and see
if he finished

291
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,125
bypassing the regulator
on deck seven.

292
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,125
Then meet us
in main engineering.

293
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,583
Understood.

294
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,250
Hey.

295
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,375
Hey.

296
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,417
Who are you?

297
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:51,583
What are you doing
on my ship?

298
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:56,125
The baryon sweep
uses a high-frequency
plasma field.

299
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,041
Your phaser won't work.

300
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:03,333
You're probably
right, but I'd like
to bet this will.

301
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,917
A laser welder
can be deadly.

302
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,542
Now, what's going on
in main engineering?

303
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,083
I suggest
that you cooperate.

304
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,709
You're Starfleet.
You won't kill me.

305
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,458
You sure?

306
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,041
(<i> hissing</i> )
(<i> groans</i> )

307
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,875
It seems you're right.

308
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,625
(<i> laughter</i> )

309
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,500
Yes, but
Tyrellian laser-art

310
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:14,083
is very similar in both
form and composition.

311
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,291
Well, of course.

312
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,500
You know, funny you
should mention that.

313
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:17,792
I used to be stationed
on Tyrellia.

314
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:18,875
Really?
Yes.

315
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:20,291
Did you know there are
currently

316
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,333
five Tyrellians serving
aboard the<i> Enterprise?</i>

317
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,667
That's fascinating.
Not too many people
know this, but Tyrellia

318
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:29,583
is only one of three
known inhabited planets
without a magnetic pole.

319
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,458
I was aware of that,
but are<i> you</i> aware

320
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,834
that Tyrellia is one
of seven known planets

321
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,375
with no atmosphere
whatsoever?

322
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,458
Really?
Mm.

323
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,041
They're still at it.

324
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,333
Nonstop.
I have to admit,

325
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,875
it has a sort of
strange fascination.

326
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:46,542
How long can two people
talk about nothing?

327
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,333
Is something wrong?

328
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,250
Uh, I don't know.
I was just getting some

329
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,083
very strange energy readings
from your table here.

330
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,959
Well, I'm sure
it's nothing serious.

331
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,750
Perhaps the heating
element underneath the
table is malfunctioning.

332
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,417
Maybe I should take
a look at it for you.

333
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,166
I'm sure we can
handle this,

334
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,625
whatever
it is, Commander.

335
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,667
There's no need
to concern yourself.

336
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:20,542
LA FORGE:
Well, maybe I should
look at the element.

337
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,709
I mean, in case...

338
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,375
It's all right.
Please, don't worry.

339
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:26,709
What's that all about?

340
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,291
ORTON:
I assure you, Commander
La Forge, it's all right.

341
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,583
We'll look into it.

342
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,917
You don't have
to concern yourself.

343
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,709
Orton, now!

344
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,917
(<i> grunts</i> )

345
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,417
What is going on?!

346
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,125
(<i> groans, Troi gasps</i> )

347
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,291
Stay right where you are.

348
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:16,583
Reduce the plasma pressure
to 0.6 percent nominal.

349
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,917
Zero point six.

350
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:21,500
How does
the conduit look?

351
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,166
It's clear.

352
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,458
All right.
The main plasma flow

353
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,959
has been shunted to
the aft conduit.

354
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,750
We're ready here.

355
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:35,709
Okay, that should
do it, I think.

356
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:39,583
Be sure, Neil.

357
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,125
Uh, yes.

358
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,125
Yeah, that does it.

359
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,375
Um, all right.

360
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:49,375
Transfer 500 milligrams
from the reserve system
to the engine core.

361
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,000
Perfect.

362
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,542
Adequate. Disable
the containment overrides

363
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,250
and get the interlocks
off the magnetic seal.

364
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:06,333
Pomet, prepare
the transport assembly.

365
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,083
Keep watching
that power flow.

366
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,917
It might...

367
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,250
Keep working.

368
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:25,291
Where'd he come from?

369
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,875
Found him on deck seven.

370
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,333
Who are you?

371
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,458
My name is Mot.

372
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,917
I'm, uh,
I'm the barber.

373
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,542
Barber? What the hell
are you doing here?

374
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,291
Everyone was supposed
to be evacuated
to the surface.

375
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:44,333
Yes, I know, um...
but I wanted to go riding,
but I didn't have my saddle.

376
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,834
So, I went back...
Your saddle?

377
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:49,500
Yes, that's right.
It's on deck seven.

378
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,083
I left it in
the corridor.

379
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,750
And then the power went out,
and I got lost, and...

380
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,083
All right, all right,
shut up.
I didn't know...

381
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,709
Just shut up!

382
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,917
Any sign of Devor?

383
00:21:58,959 --> 00:21:59,917
No.

384
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,625
(<i> sighs</i> )

385
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,375
Satler.

386
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:05,000
Get down here,
and, uh...

387
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,041
keep an eye
on our barber.

388
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,083
All right, go see if
you can find Devor.

389
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,291
Make sure
nothing's wrong.

390
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,875
Sit down.

391
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,583
All right.

392
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,542
Look, just don't point
that thing at me.

393
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:26,959
Just do what I
tell you, and you
won't have to worry.

394
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,291
How long
until you're ready?

395
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,208
40, maybe 50 minutes.

396
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,959
The baryon sweep
hits this compartment
in 30 minutes.

397
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,667
The field diverter
will protect us.

398
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,709
It is not us
I'm worried about--
it's that storage unit.

399
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,834
I want the trilithium
resin in there and secured
before the sweep gets here.

400
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,583
I don't want to take
any chances.

401
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,709
Understood.

402
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:25,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

403
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:28,583
They haven't tried
to communicate
with the outside.

404
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,750
No demands, no
political statements...

405
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:34,583
no theft.
They must want<i> something.</i>

406
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,083
Orton is not as calm
as he looks.

407
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,625
He's very agitated
and nervous,

408
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,375
as if something's
gone wrong.

409
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:44,333
It is possible
that Geordi upset
their timetable

410
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,959
when he saw the
hidden weapons.

411
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,250
Orton may be
improvising.

412
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,875
Maybe he didn't plan to
take us hostage so early

413
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:52,458
and now he doesn't
know what to do.

414
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,667
If they do not
have a plan for
this contingency,

415
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,750
we may have
the initiative.

416
00:23:56,792 --> 00:24:00,500
Maybe, but we need to
figure out how to use it.

417
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,959
How is he?

418
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,959
There's no
permanent damage.

419
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,458
I've adjusted the
optical transducer
in his visor

420
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,041
to block out
some of the pain
receptors in his brain.

421
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,500
It's only
partially effective.

422
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:16,291
I need to get him
to a medical facility.

423
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,834
I doubt if they'll
agree to that.

424
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:23,750
But maybe if we tell
them Geordi's dying,

425
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:26,667
they would give us access
to a medical kit.

426
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:30,375
We might be able to
use some of the tools
to make a weapon.

427
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:33,917
Perhaps we can use
the visor as a weapon.

428
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,333
If the optical transducer
were modified,

429
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,417
we might be able
to generate
a hypersonic pulse.

430
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,250
A hypersonic pulse
would overload

431
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,500
the audio receptors
of everyone in this room.

432
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,875
It would cause
immediate unconsciousness.

433
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:52,625
Can you make the adjustment
on the visor yourself?

434
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:55,208
It will look suspicious
if you're both working on it.

435
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,834
CRUSHER:
I'll try.

436
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:00,792
I might need Geordi
to help me through
some of it.

437
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,041
RIKER:
All right.

438
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,041
Be as casual
as you can.

439
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,875
Let me know when
you're ready.

440
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:26,125
Ready.

441
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,583
All right, begin
draining the trilithium

442
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,417
at 100 milligrams
per minute.

443
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:11,041
(<i> alarm wailing</i> )

Neil, get over here!

445
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:15,583
Put that down!
Protect it.

(<i> Satler screaming</i> )

448
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,875
The primary inducer
is completely fused.

449
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:05,917
There's no way to fix it.
Without the diverter,

450
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,000
we don't have any protection
from the baryon sweep.

451
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:12,083
I know that.
How long before the
baryon sweep gets here?

452
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,000
About 12 minutes.

453
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,959
We should go
to Ten-Forward.

454
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,417
That's the last place
on the ship

455
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:20,166
that'll be swept
by the baryon field.

456
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,750
All right.
We're leaving.

457
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:26,250
But we're taking
the trilithium with us.

458
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:27,583
What?!

459
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,041
Do you know how
volatile trilithium is?

460
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:34,041
We can't just start hauling
it through the ship.

461
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:39,291
I'll... I'll try to
make some modifications.

462
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,166
Satler's dead.

463
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:51,834
He ran into
the baryon sweep.

464
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,291
What about Mot?

465
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,000
I don't know, but I
don't think he's a barber.

466
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:59,709
I found this
in the Jefferies tube.

Kelsey to Kiros.

469
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:33,500
This is Kiros.

470
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:35,250
We have a problem.

471
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:38,125
There's a Starfleet
officer still aboard.

472
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:40,458
He's killed Satler
and he may have
killed Devor.

473
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,083
He also destroyed the
diverter in engineering,

474
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:46,083
so we have to leave here
before the baryon sweep
enters this section.

475
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,083
What about
the trilithium resin?

476
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:50,125
We're taking it with us
to Ten-Forward.

477
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,709
There should be
enough time before...

478
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,291
Kelsey, don't be a fool.

479
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,458
You know better than to try
to move trilithium resin.

480
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,333
Mr. Mot, or should I
call you "Lieutenant"?

481
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:02,041
"Lieutenant Commander,"
perhaps?

482
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,000
You can call me
whatever you wish,

483
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:07,417
but moving trilithium
resin requires very
specific equipment.

484
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,000
You can't just
improvise something.

485
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,417
I wouldn't need
to improvise

486
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:12,500
if you hadn't damaged
our field diverter.

487
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:15,208
But if you're so concerned
about the trilithium,

488
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,291
I suggest you stop
interfering with us before
you set off an explosion

489
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:22,166
that would destroy
the<i> Enterprise</i> and you.

490
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,166
I would rather
destroy the ship
than allow that resin

491
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:26,917
to fall into the hands
of terrorists.

492
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,667
What makes you think
I'm a terrorist?

493
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:34,959
Trilithium resin is a
highly toxic waste product
produced by our engines.

494
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,667
It's only possible use
could be as a weapon.

495
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:42,083
You might be right,
Mr. Mot,

496
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:45,375
but we've been planning
for this for a long time,

497
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:48,250
and I doubt you'll really
be able to stop us...

(<i> no audio</i> )

499
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,709
...or even slow us down.

500
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:02,125
There.

501
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:05,166
300 milligrams
of trilithium.

502
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:10,166
I'm, uh, using
a dynamic stabilizer
to act as a control rod.

503
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,875
There.

504
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:15,000
That should keep
the resin stable
enough for transport.

Come on!

Three more decks.

Then we take

the way to Ten-Forward.

What's wrong?

513

We have to find
another way up.

The rungs are cut.

That wasn't very
clever, Mr. Mot.

If you knew where
we were, you should
have attacked us.

517
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,291
Now we'll just take
another route--

00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,625
one you might not
be able to predict.

519
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:16,875
There are only so many
ways to Ten-Forward.

520
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:19,083
Ten-forward is the
logical place to be

521
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,959
if you want to stay ahead
of the baryon sweep.

522
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,500
That sweep is just
as big a threat to you
as it is to us.

523
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:27,709
In fact, if I
were you, Mr. Mot,

524
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,834
I'd be trying to find
another way off this ship.

525
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:37,709
I plan on leaving
the same way you do--
on your ship.

526
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,625
What ship?
Come on, Kelsey.

527
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,625
If you've been
planning this so long,
you must have a way

528
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:46,959
of getting off
the<i> Enterprise</i> and
leaving this system.

529
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,417
I think you have
a ship coming for you.

530
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:52,041
I plan to be on it.

531
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,041
It's a small ship, Mot.

532
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:57,250
I don't think there's
going to be room
for both of us.

533
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,750
I'm sorry to hear that.

534
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,083
I'll send your regrets.

535
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,792
How is he, Doctor?

536
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:31,375
He's in a lot of
pain, but I think
he should be fine.

537
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:34,291
He needs some water.
Is that all right?

538
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,166
(<i> speaking softly</i> ):
We're almost ready.

539
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:52,375
When we set the
visor to emit the
hypersonic pulse,

540
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:53,959
there'll be a
short burst of light.

541
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,291
We need a distraction.

542
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:12,500
They need a distraction.

543
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:14,041
How long?

544
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:15,959
Just a few seconds.

545
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,166
I think I can distract
Orton for a few seconds.

546
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:22,583
I don't think Orton's
in a talking mood, Will.

547
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,709
You just have to know
how to talk<i> to</i> him.

548
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:36,250
Orton, I think we need
to discuss this situation.

549
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,917
There is nothing
to discuss.

550
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,458
Sit down.

551
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,458
There is a lot
to discuss.

552
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,625
Can't we be reasonable?

553
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:44,458
I am not interested
in hearing

554
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,625
your hostage negotiation
tactics, Commander.

555
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:50,667
Well, it can't hurt you
to listen, can it?

556
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:54,667
All right.
Thank you.

557
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:58,667
Now, the first thing
I think we need to
discuss is this.

558
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:00,166
(<i> grunts</i> )

559
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,375
(<i> grunts</i> )

560
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:45,500
(<i> grunts in pain</i> )

561
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:03,834
KIROS:
Hold it.

562
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,625
Put your weapon down.

563
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,041
Kelsey, this is Kiros.

564
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,834
I'm on deck ten.
I have Mot.

565
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:24,834
Is he alive?
Yes.

566
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:28,458
Good. Meet us
at intersection 41.

567
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,583
Understood.

568
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:34,083
This way.

569
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:54,583
(<i> panting</i> )

570
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:59,291
Give me the trilithium.

571
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,583
How much farther
do we have to go?

572
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,417
Not far.

573
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:08,166
With all the modifications
you've made to this unit,

574
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,917
are we going to have
any problems removing
the trilithium?

575
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:14,709
No. Just remove
the control rod.

576
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,583
Drain the unit.

577
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,500
There shouldn't
be any problem.

578
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:21,709
That's all
I wanted to know.

579
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:31,458
Well, not as clever
as you thought.

580
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,709
Where's Pomet?

581
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,417
He shot him with
some kind of an arrow.

582
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:38,417
He's not dead.
Well, he will be soon.

583
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,792
The sweep's nearly here,
and we don't have time
to go back for him.

584
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:42,291
What about Neil?

585
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,917
The sweep got him.

586
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:45,709
Let's go.

587
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,667
I thought you were just
going to talk to him.

588
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,291
I did. He just didn't
like what I had to say.

589
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,041
(<i> beeping</i> )
Mm.

590
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:18,250
That was a perimeter
warning from the
Remmler Array.

591
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:20,291
A small ship
is approaching.

592
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,875
I believe Mr. Orton
has dropped his
defense shields.

593
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,792
This must be the sign
they were waiting for.

594
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:29,041
Mr. Data, you will be
the only one unaffected
by the hypersonic burst.

595
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,500
As soon as everyone
else is unconscious,

596
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:36,417
I need you to get to
that computer panel and
stop that ship somehow.

597
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:38,583
I will try, sir.

598
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,000
Now.

599
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,542
(<i> high-pitched humming</i> )

600
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:03,834
Kelsey, perhaps we
can work out a deal.

601
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,834
You're the only one
who needs a deal, Mot.

602
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:10,458
My name isn't Mot.
It's Jean-Luc Picard.

603
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,375
Captain Picard.
This is all beginning
to make sense.

604
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,583
Leave the trilithium here
and take me with you.

605
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,500
You can use me as
a hostage instead
of threatening...

606
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:21,041
I am not a
terrorist, Captain,

607
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:22,917
nor do I have
a political agenda,

608
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:25,542
although I know
some people who
do have agendas,

609
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:29,583
and they are very
interested in this
little container.

610
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:34,083
Profit. This is
all about profit.

611
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,709
I prefer to think
of it as commerce.

612
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:49,375
Open the door.

613
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:07,875
Now go through...
slowly.

614
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,834
(<i> yelling</i> )

615
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,125
(<i> both grunting</i> )

616
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,792
(<i> beeping</i> )

617
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:08,750
Well, Picard, I guess

618
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:12,166
I'll be the one to
send your regrets.

619
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:21,625
Picard to Arkaria Base.

620
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:24,667
Deactivate
the baryon sweep.

621
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:34,083
Arkaria Base,
this is Captain Picard
onboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

622
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:37,083
Deactivate
the baryon sweep.

623
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,959
Arkaria Base,
this is Captain Picard.

624
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,333
Deactivate the baryon
sweep immediately!

625
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:07,333
Data to Captain Picard.
Do you read me, sir?

626
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:08,875
Picard here.

627
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:11,166
Are you all right,
Captain?

628
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:13,250
Yes, Mr. Data.

629
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:15,375
Sir, an unidentified
scout ship

630
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,000
has just beamed someone
off the<i> Enterprise.</i>

631
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:19,375
Do you know
anything about it?

632
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:25,667
I know they won't
get very far.

633
00:42:56,917 --> 00:43:01,333
Hold still.
You have a nasty
little cut here.

634
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:02,750
Any luck?

635
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:04,417
I'm sorry, Captain.

636
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,667
I don't know what could
have happened to it.

637
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,959
Hold still. I can't
heal this cleanly

638
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,458
if you don't
stop fidgeting.

639
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,083
I've had three security
teams search deck seven.

640
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:14,166
They couldn't find
anything.

641
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:15,667
There.

642
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,458
I found it.

643
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:27,083
Someone put it in
a maintenance locker.

644
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:28,834
Thank you.

645
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:31,792
Captain, you keep
a saddle on board?

646
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:33,959
RIKER:
Mr. Worf, I'm
surprised at you.

647
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,834
Anyone who is
an experienced rider

648
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,458
naturally has
his own saddle.

649
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,333
TROI:
It's perfectly normal.

650
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:42,291
Actually,
it came in handy.

651
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:46,500
I only wish I had
had the opportunity
to use it on a horse.

652
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,792
Of course.
