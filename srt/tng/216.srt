1
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,875
Hot chocolate, please.

2
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:13,458
(<i> chuckling</i> )

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,709
We, uh, we don't
ordinarily say "please"

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,875
to food dispensers
around here.

5
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:21,583
Well, since it's listed as
intelligent circuitry, why not?

6
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,542
After all, working with so much
artificial intelligence

7
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,542
can be dehumanizing, right?

8
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:30,166
So why not combat that tendency
with a little simple courtesy?

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,542
Ah, thank you.

10
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,000
For someone who just arrived,

11
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,500
you certainly aren't shy
with your opinions.

12
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:36,750
Have I been
talking too much?

13
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:38,208
No.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,333
Oh, I do tend to have a bit
of a motor mouth,

15
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,333
especially
when I'm excited.

16
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,625
You don't know how
exciting it is

17
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,333
to have gotten this assignment.

18
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,625
Everyone in class, I mean
everyone wants the<i> Enterprise.</i>

19
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,291
I mean it would have been
all right to spend some time

20
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,500
on Reina 6, do phase work
with antimatter.

21
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:54,959
That's my specialty.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,250
I know.

23
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,375
That's why you got
this assignment.

24
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:00,709
I did it again.

25
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,750
It's just that...

26
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:03,709
I know, you're excited.

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,041
Look, Sonya...
Yes?

28
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,792
I don't think
you want to be around

29
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,750
these control stations with
that hot chocolate. Do you?

30
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:12,458
Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't even
have this in engineering.

31
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,583
It's just we were talking.

32
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,625
I forgot I had it
in my hand.

33
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,500
Um... I'm going to go
finish it over here.

34
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,208
Lieutenant LaForge,

35
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,542
this is not going to
happen again.

36
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, no, oh, I'm sorry,
oh, captain.

37
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,709
Actually,
it's my fault, sir.

38
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,875
Picard:
Indeed.

39
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,375
Oh, I wasn't looking.

40
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:36,917
It's all over you.

41
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,083
Yes, ensign,
it's all over me.

42
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,583
At least let me, sir.

43
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,917
Ensign, uh, ensign...?

44
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,208
Oh, Ensign Sonya Gomez.

45
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,542
Ensign Gomez is a recent
Academy graduate, captain.

46
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,083
She just transferred over
at Starbase 173.

47
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,917
Is that so?

48
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,917
Well, Ensign Sonya Gomez,

49
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,500
I think it will be simpler
if I simply change my uniform.

50
00:01:57,542 --> 00:02:01,542
Captain, I must accept
full responsibility for this...

51
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, chief engineer.

52
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,125
I think I understand.

53
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,166
I just want to say, sir,

54
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,041
that I'm very excited
about this assignment,

55
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,709
and I promise to serve
you and my ship...

56
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,250
<i>your</i> ship, this ship

57
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,667
to the best of my ability.

58
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:19,875
Yes, ensign,
I'm sure that you will.

59
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:21,375
Carry on.

60
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,125
Oh, my.

61
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,542
First impressions, right?

62
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,667
Isn't that what they say,
first impressions

63
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,125
are the most important?

64
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,542
I'll give you this,

65
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,625
it's a meeting the captain
won't soon forget.

66
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,667
Oh.

67
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,208
Deck 9, officers' quarters.

68
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,041
Crewman, what is going on?

69
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,959
man:
Welcome Picard
to shuttlecraft 6.

70
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,834
Q.

71
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,667
There, there,
haven't we been careless?

72
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,500
A little cleaning service
I'm only too happy to provide.

73
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:13,583
We agreed you would never
trouble my ship again.

74
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,709
I always keep
my arrangements, sir.

75
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,959
Look...

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,750
we're nowhere near
your vessel.

77
00:03:56,041 --> 00:04:00,542
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

78
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,875
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

79
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,417
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

80
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:10,583
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

81
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:15,083
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

82
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,542
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

83
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,583
I read your graduating thesis.

84
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:22,291
Now, I wouldn't have requested
you if you weren't the best.

85
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,291
Where are we going?

86
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,458
Ten forward.

87
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,083
We're going to forget
about work.

88
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,333
We are going sit, talk,
relax, look at the stars.

89
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,959
<i>You</i> need to learn
how to slow down.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,917
Oh no. No, no, no,
I can't do that.

91
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,375
You know, you're awfully young

92
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:36,875
to be so driven.

93
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes, I am.

94
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,041
I had to be.

95
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,291
I had to be the best

96
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,792
because only the best
get to be here.

97
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,834
Geordi...

98
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,250
lieutenant...

99
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,542
That's okay.

100
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:51,083
Go on.

101
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,583
Whatever is out here,

102
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,792
we're going to be
the first humans to see it.

103
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,667
And I want to be a part of that.

104
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,750
I want to
understand it.

105
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,333
Sonya, relax.

106
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,291
You're here.

107
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,709
You've made it.

108
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,750
But you won't last long
banging into walls.

109
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,750
It'll be there for
you, believe me.

110
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,417
Okay.

111
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,792
Look, I promise I won't let
anything exciting slip past

112
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:14,625
without letting
you know, okay?

113
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,291
Okay.
Okay.

114
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,208
Bridge, this is ten forward.

115
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,667
Guinan, I don't remember you
ever calling the bridge before.

116
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,750
Is everything all right?

117
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,083
How do you mean?

118
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:33,208
Is there anything
unusual happening?

119
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,125
No, Guinan, nothing out
of the ordinary.

120
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,375
Why do you ask?

121
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:39,834
I'm not sure.

122
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,250
It's just a feeling.

123
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,542
I've had it a couple
of times before.

124
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,417
It's probably nothing.

125
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,709
Forget that I called.

126
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,125
Ten forward out.

127
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,208
The locator beam
won't help.

128
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,208
They'll never think
to look for you this far away.

129
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,083
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is Picard.

130
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:11,083
Stop this foolishness, Q.

131
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,375
Return me to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

132
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,166
I suggest you change
your attitude.

133
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,166
Petulance does not become you.

134
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,041
We have business, Picard.

135
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,542
Keeping me a prisoner here

136
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,750
will not compel me
to discuss anything with you.

137
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,417
It will in time.

138
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,625
I appreciate your advice,
lieutenant.

139
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:33,291
And I'll take it
to heart...

140
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,542
Guinan.

141
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,750
Can I get you something?

142
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,041
We're fine.

143
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,041
Is everything all right?

144
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,542
I don't know.

145
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,542
I um, I think I'll go
check out engineering.

146
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,166
I'll go with you.

147
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,250
Where's the captain?

148
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,583
In his quarters.

149
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,542
Captain, this is
Counselor Troi.

150
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:08,625
Computer, locate
Captain Picard.

151
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:11,583
computer:
The captain is not on the ship.

152
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,959
Worf:
Commander,

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,709
there's a shuttle
missing from bay 2.

154
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,959
All stop.

155
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,417
Answering all stop, sir.

156
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,917
I've hailed the shuttle
on all frequencies.

157
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,250
No response.

158
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,417
Data:
Sensors indicate
no shuttle

159
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,667
or other ships
in this sector.

160
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:39,750
I think we can assume
the captain's

161
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,542
aboard that shuttle.

162
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,667
How could he get to the
shuttlebay and leave
the<i> Enterprise</i>

163
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,291
without us knowing?
That's not possible.

164
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,125
Take it easy, Wes.
We're going to find him.

165
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,333
I want to begin
a methodical search.

166
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,458
Worf, set sensors
on maximum scan.

167
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,917
Data, use our present location
as the center.

168
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,125
Plot a search pattern
from these coordinates

169
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,083
to cover the most area
in the least time.

170
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,083
Search pattern
has been input, sir.

171
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,625
Engage, Mr. Crusher.

172
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:14,125
<i>First officer's log,</i>
<i>stardate 42761.3.</i>

173
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,917
<i>We have not been able</i>
<i>to determine why or how</i>

174
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,166
<i>Captain Picard left</i>
<i>the Enterprise.</i>

175
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,458
<i>We can't even be certain</i>
<i>he is in the missing shuttle</i>

176

00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,709
We have covered the area
in a spherical pattern

181
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,083
which a vessel
without warp drive

182
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,000
could traverse
in the time allotted.

183
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,291
Widen the area.

184
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:44,959
Do we stay out here
years, decades?

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,083
I'm ageless, Picard.

186
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,250
You are not.

187
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:58,375
The<i> Enterprise</i> will continue
with Riker as captain.

188
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:00,875
You are an impossibly
stubborn human.

189
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,834
Return me to my ship.

190
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,875
If I return you to your ship,

191
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,458
will you agree to give
my request a full hearing?

192
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,583
You're right, Picard.

193
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,750
This is the proper venue
for our discussion.

194
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:34,083
Commander, my status board
indicates the shuttle

195
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,875
is back in bay 2.

196
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:38,000
Computer, locate Captain Picard.

197
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,250
computer:
Captain Picard
is in ten forward.

198
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,750
I knew it was you.

199
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,583
You!

200
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,333
Picard, if you had half
the sense you pretend to have,

201
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,917
you would get her
off your ship immediately.

202
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,959
And if you like,
I'd be more than pleased

203
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,500
to expedite her departure.

204
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,417
You know him?

205
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,750
We have had some dealings.

206
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:19,375
Those dealings were
two centuries ago.

207
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,667
This creature is not
what she appears to be.

208
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,041
She's an imp.

209
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:26,166
And where she goes,
trouble always follows.

210
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,417
You're speaking of yourself,
Q, not Guinan.

211
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,750
Guinan?

212
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,083
Is that your name now?

213
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,041
Guinan is not
the issue here-- you are.

214
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,375
We had a agreement that you
would stop meddling with us.

215
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,500
Q:
And so I have.

216
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:38,709
What do you want, Q?

217
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,458
You state your business.
Get on with it.

218
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I agree, captain.

219
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,333
Enough about this creature.

220
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,500
She's diverting us

221
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:47,417
from the purpose
of my being here.

222
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,792
Which is?

223
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:55,417
Ah, the redoubtable
Commander Riker

224
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,208
and micro-brain.

225
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,291
Growl for me.

226
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,750
Let me know
you still care.

227
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,125
Worf.

228
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,834
My purpose is
to join you.

229
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,041
To join us as what?

230
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,208
As a member of the crew.

231
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,083
Willing and able,
ready to serve.

232
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,542
This ship is already home

233
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,917
for the indigent,
the unwanted, the unworthy.

234
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,333
Why not for a homeless entity?

235
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,041
Homeless?
Yes.

236
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,542
The other members of the Q
continuum kicked you out?

237
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,208
Guinan:
Not all the Q
are alike.

238
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,625
Some are almost respectable.

239
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,458
Ready and willing,
able to serve.

240
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,500
What would you do?

241
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,208
Would you start
as an ordinary crewman?

242
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,458
Hmm?

243
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,083
What task is too menial
for an entity?

244
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,583
Sir, do you mock me?

245
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,709
Not at all, that's
the last thing I would do.

246
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,667
<i>You</i> by definition are
part of our charter.

247
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:51,041
Our mission is to seek out
new and different life-forms.

248
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,083
And you certainly qualify
as one of the most unique

249
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,208
I've ever encountered.

250
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,375
To learn about you is
frankly provocative,

251
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,542
but you're next of
kin to chaos.

252
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,500
Captain, at least allow me
to present my argument.

253
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,041
Worf.

254
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,709
After our last encounter,

255
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,792
I was asked to leave
the Q continuum.

256
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,709
Since then,
I've been wandering vaguely.

257
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,959
Bored, really.

258
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,792
My existence
without purpose.

259
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,917
Then I remembered all
the good times I had with you.

260
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,875
The good times?
The first time we met you,

261
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,291
you put us on trial for
the crimes of humanity.

262
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,417
Of which you were exonerated.
The next time we saw you,

263
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,917
you asked<i> me</i> to join
the Q continuum.

264
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:35,000
A big mistake that you
didn't accept my offer.

265
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:39,125
More and more
I realize that here,<i> here</i> is
where I want to be.

266
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,375
Think of
the advantages.

267
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:45,041
Now, I neither expect nor
require any special treatment.

268
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,625
And if necessary,
although I can't imagine why,

269
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,125
I will renounce my powers

270
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,500
and become as weak and as
incompetent as all of you.

271
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,667
No.

272
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:03,959
No?

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,125
Oh, captain, in fairness,
let me try.

274
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,750
I deserve at least that much.

275
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,291
In fairness?
You disrupt this ship,

276
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,959
you kidnap the captain.

277
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,709
I add a little excitement,
a little spice to your lives,

278
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,291
and all you do
is complain.

279
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,750
Where's your adventurous spirit,
your imagination?

280
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,333
Think, Picard, think.

281
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,083
Think of the
possibilities.

282
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,041
Simply speaking,
we don't trust you.

283
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:28,834
Oh, well, you may not trust me,
but you do need me.

284
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,542
You're not prepared
for what awaits you.

285
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:34,000
How can we be prepared
for that which we do not know?

286
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,625
But I do know that we are
ready to encounter it.

287
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:38,709
Really?

288
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,917
Yes, absolutely.

289
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,041
That's why we're out here.

290
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,166
Oh, the arrogance.

291
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,417
They don't have a clue
as to what's out here.

292
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,125
They will learn,
adapt.

293
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,250
That is their
greatest advantage.

294
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,208
They are moving faster than
expected, further than they
should.

295
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,208
By whose calculations?

296
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,125
You judge yourselves

297
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,625
against the pitiful adversaries
you've encountered so far.

298
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,542
The Romulans, the Klingons--
they're nothing

299
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,709
compared to what's waiting.

300
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,083
Picard,

301
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,709
you are about to move
into areas of the galaxy

302
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,500
containing wonders
more incredible

303
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:16,375
than you can
possibly imagine

304
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:19,792
and terrors to freeze
your soul.

305
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,959
I offer myself as a guide

306
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,625
only to be rejected
out of hand.

307
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:27,458
We'll just have to do
the best we can without you.

308
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,375
What justifies
that smugness?

309
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:32,583
Not smugness,
not arrogance.

310
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:36,208
But we are resolute,
we are determined,

311
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,500
and your help is
not required.

312
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,291
We'll just have to see
how ready you are.

313
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,583
Q!

314
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,417
Bridge, this is the captain.

315
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,667
All stop.

316
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:06,291
Wesley:
Answering all stop, sir.

317
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,458
Status?

318
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,709
According to these
coordinates,

319
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,041
we have traveled
7,000 light years

320
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,166
and are located
near the system J-25.

321
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,083
Travel time
to the nearest starbase?

322
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,583
Data:
At maximum warp,
in two years,

323
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,375
7 months, 3 days, 18 hours,

324
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:23,542
we would reach Starbase 185.

325
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,959
Why?

326
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,750
Why? Why, to give you
a taste of your future,

327
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:32,125
a preview of things to come.

328
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,542
<i>Con permiso, capitan.</i>

329
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:38,625
The hall is rented,
the orchestra engaged.

330
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:41,166
It's now time to see
if you can dance.

331
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,709
Guinan, your people have been
in this part of the galaxy.

332
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,917
Yes.

333
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:55,667
What can you tell us?

334
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:01,458
Only that if I were you,
I'd start back now.

335
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:13,208
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>stardate 42761.9.</i>

336
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,000
<i>Despite Guinan's warning,</i>
<i>I feel compelled to investigate</i>

337
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,291
<i>this unexplored sector</i>
<i>of the galaxy</i>

338
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,709
<i>before heading back.</i>

339
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,875
Worf:
Captain, the sixth planet
in the system is class M.

340
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:27,709
There is a series of roads
on this planet

341
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,458
which indicates a highly
industrialized civilization.

342
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,375
But where there
should be cities,

343
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:35,375
there are only great rips
in the surface.

344
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:37,625
It is though some
great force just scooped

345
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:41,125
all the machine elements off
the face of the planet.

346
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,667
It is identical to
what happened to the outposts

347
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,041
along the Neutral Zone.

348
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,834
Worf:
Captain.

349
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,208
We are being probed.

350
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,959
What is the source
of the probe?

351
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,041
A ship.

352
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,709
It is on an intercept course.

353
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,500
On screen.

354
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,458
Picard:
Magnify.

355
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:05,500
Riker:
Full scan.

356
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,083
Go to yellow alert.

357
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,542
Worf:
Going to yellow alert.

358
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,875
Riker:
Keep the shields down.

359
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,375
We don't want
to appear provocative.

360
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,792
Worf:
Aye, sir.

361
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:17,208
Mr. Data,
what can you tell us?

362
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,250
The ship is strangely
generalized in design.

363
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,000
There is no specific bridge,

364
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,208
no command center.

365
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,417
There is no engineering section.

366
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:31,875
I can identify
no living quarters.

367
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,125
Life signs?

368
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,166
Data:
There is no
indication of life.

369
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,291
Lieutenant Worf

370
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,917
what is its
alert status?

371
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:43,333
I detect no shields,
no weapons of any known design.

372
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,291
Hailing frequencies.
Open.

373
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:49,750
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the U.S.S.<i> Enterprise.</i>

374
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,000
No response.

375
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,417
This is Captain Picard

376
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,667
representing the United
Federation of Planets.

377
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:00,000
Guinan.

378
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,667
Activate your viewscreen.

379
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:04,000
I would like you to monitor
what's going on up here.

380
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,583
We may need your input.

381
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,792
I'm here, captain.

382
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,625
Guinan:
Viewscreen's activated.

383
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,125
I have the other ship.

384
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,458
You're familiar
with this life-form?

385
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,083
Yes.

386
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,291
My people encountered
them a century ago.

387
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,834
They destroyed our cities,

388
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,834
scattered my people
throughout the galaxy.

389
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,959
They're called the Borg.

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,542
Protect yourself, captain,
or they'll destroy you.

391
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,417
Shields up.

392
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,792
Aye, sir.

393
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:44,000
Riker:
All decks stand by.

394
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,834
Security, report
to main engineering.

395
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,291
We have an intruder.

396
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,417
Lieutenant?

397
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,667
Status?

398
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:41,792
It seemed to make a visual
survey of the engine core, sir.

399
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,291
Then it moved in here.

400
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,959
Interesting,
isn't it?

401
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,709
Not a he,
not a she.

402
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,792
Not like anything
you've ever seen.

403
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:56,000
An enhanced
humanoid.

404
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,375
What is it you want?

405
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,542
We mean you no harm.

406
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,542
Do you understand me?

407
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,125
Understand you?

408
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,625
You're nothing to him.

409
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,208
He's not interested
in your life-form.

410
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,834
He's just a scout,
the first of many.

411
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,542
He's here to analyze
your technology.

412
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,542
He may attempt to gain
control of the ship.

413
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,792
I wouldn't let him.

414
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,709
Stop.

415
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,542
I cannot allow you to interfere
with the operation of this ship.

416
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,250
Mr. Worf.

417
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,667
Ensign.

418
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,417
(<i> groans</i> )

419
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,417
Mister Worf.

420
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,458
Use whatever means
to neutralize the invader.

421
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,750
Because her people had contact
with the Borg,

422
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:15,250
I've requested Guinan to
participate in this conference.

423
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:18,417
You are aware of what occurred
just now in main engineering?

424
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,291
Yes.

425
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,083
What happened between
your people and the Borg?

426
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:26,834
I wasn't there personally.

427
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:32,291
But from what I'm told,

428
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:35,709
they swarmed
through our system,

429
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,583
and when they left...

430
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:43,417
there was little or nothing
left of my people.

431
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:47,041
Guinan, if they were
that aggressive, why
didn't the Borg attack?

432
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,208
They could have,
but they didn't.

433
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,000
They don't do that individually.
That's not their way.

434
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:55,250
When they decide to come,
they're gonna come in force.

435
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,875
They don't do
anything piecemeal.

436
00:24:57,917 --> 00:24:59,709
Then the initial encounter
was solely

437
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,166
for the purpose
of gathering information?

438
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,875
Yes.

439
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,291
How do we reason with them,

440
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,667
let them know
that we're not a threat?

441
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,375
You don't.

442
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:14,583
At least, I've never known
anyone who did.

443
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,250
Worf:
Captain, we are being hailed.

444
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,000
On screen.

445
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,583
This is Captain
Jean-Luc Picard of the U.S.--

446
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:31,333
Borg:
We have analyzed your
defensive capabilities

447
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,750
as being unable
to withstand us.

448
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:36,417
If you defend yourselves,
you will be punished.

449
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,208
Hmm.

450
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,125
Counselor?

451
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,500
We're not dealing
with an individual mind.

452
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,709
They don't have
a single leader.

453
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,709
It's the collective
minds of all of them.

454
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,542
That would have definite
advantages.

455
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,959
Yes, a single leader
can make mistakes

456
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,458
which is far less likely
in the combined whole.

457
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,583
Q:
Picard?

458
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,625
Phew, Picard, are you
sure you don't want me

459
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,083
as a member of your crew?

460
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,667
Worf:
Captain, the Borg have
locked on to us

461
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:13,583
with some form
of tractor beam.

462
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,041
We're on our way.

463
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,000
Report, lieutenant.

464
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,709
Worf:
That beam is draining
our shields.

465
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,417
Riker:
If they pull down our shields,
we're helpless.

466
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:31,667
Warp 8, any heading.

467
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:33,375
Engage.

468
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:35,542
Captain, the beam is
holding us here.

469
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,083
Increase the power.

470
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,375
Shields weakening.

471
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:39,959
Shields will be down
in 18 seconds.

472
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,125
Locate the exact source
of that tractor beam.

473
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,208
Lock on phasers.

474
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,250
Phasers locked on target.

475
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,542
Fire.

476
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,875
They still have us.

477
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:54,000
Shields are down, sir.

478
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:10,250
A type of laser beam is
slicing into the saucer section.

479
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,750
They're carving us up
like a roast.

480
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,000
With whatever force necessary,
terminate that beam.

481
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,750
Fire when ready.

482
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,834
Again, Mr. Worf.

483
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,875
Tractor beam
is released, sir.

484
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:42,750
Force field is maintaining
our hull integrity.

485
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:43,834
Damage report?

486
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,125
Worf:
Coming in, sir.

487
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:52,250
Sections 27, 28, 29
on decks 4, 5, and 6 destroyed.

488
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:54,041
Casualties?

489
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,917
18 were in that section
and are missing.

490
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:07,291
What is the condition
of the alien ship?

491
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:11,083
They have sustained damage
to 20% of their vessel.

492
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,500
Life supports minimal.

493
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,542
Conference.

494
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,667
I can't get
the shields up.

495
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:30,083
Divert power
from anywhere you need it.

496
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,250
Anywhere except
for life support.

497
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:32,917
No, no, it wouldn't help.

498
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:35,375
The circuits that control
the shields, they've be fused.

499
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:37,625
If you can't reprogram,
then re-route.

500
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:44,625
18 people...
dead just like that.

501
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:47,250
I know, just put it out
of your head.

502
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:49,208
No, I can't.
I keep seeing them.

503
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,125
Sonya, stop it.
We'll have time to grieve later.

504
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,709
Now, right now, let's just get
these shields operative.

505
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,000
Hmm?

506
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:58,291
Right. Right.
Of course.

507
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:07,667
Guinan, how much more can you
tell us about these creatures?

508
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:09,208
Bits and pieces.

509
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,500
Anything would help.

510
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:18,166
They're made up of organic
and artificial life

511
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:23,125
which has been developing
for thousands of centuries.

512
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:26,834
Q:
The Borg is
the ultimate user.

513
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:31,083
They're unlike any threat
your Federation has ever faced.

514
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:35,000
They're not interested
in political conquest,

515
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:38,250
wealth, or power
as you know it.

516
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:42,208
They're simply interested
in your ship-- its technology.

517
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,208
They've identified it
as something they can consume.

518
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,625
You brought us here,
you exposed us to it,

519
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:51,542
and you cost us
the lives of our shipmates.

520
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,792
Oh, please.

521
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,417
Number One.

522
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:01,125
18 of our people have died.

523
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,000
Please, tell us
this is one of your illusions.

524
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:09,959
Oh, no, this is as real
as your so-called life gets.

525
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,834
Geordi:
This is Lieutenant LaForge,
captain.

526
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,709
We have been able to restore
power to the shields.

527
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,458
Very good.

528
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,417
Worf:
Captain, I have the casualty
list coming on screen.

529
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,750
Cancel.
We'll deal with that later.

530
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,208
Sir, if we're going to have any
further dealings with the Borg

531
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,208
now or in the future,

532
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,166
I think we should find out
all we can about them.

533
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:35,500
Visit their ship?

534
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,166
In my opinion,
that's the only choice.

535
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:41,750
Assemble a minimal away team.

536
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:42,917
Guinan:
What?

537
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:47,166
Mr. Worf,
Transporter room 3.

538
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,333
Data.

539
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:50,500
I wouldn't go there
if I were you.

540
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,417
I don't know Guinan,
they paid us a visit.

541
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,583
It seems only fair that
we return the courtesy.

542
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,709
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

543
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,417
<i>We have been attacked</i>
<i>without provocation</i>

544
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:09,750
<i>by an alien race</i>
<i>which Guinan calls the Borg.</i>

545
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:12,291
<i>It appears that we have</i>
<i>neutralized their vessel.</i>

546
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,333
<i>Commander Riker is leading</i>
<i>an away team</i>

547
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:17,291
<i>in an attempt</i>
<i>to learn more about them.</i>

548
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,250
There are
no life sign readings.

549
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:21,875
I've laid in
coordinates

550
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,583
that should set you down in
the least damaged section

551
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,917
of the Borg ship.

552
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,709
Set phasers on stun.

553
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,000
Be ready to increase power
in case we need it.

554
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,667
Energize.

555
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:57,000
I wonder why they
don't react to us

556
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,959
or why the<i> Enterprise</i>
didn't read any life signs,

557
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,250
especially with this
many of them.

558
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,000
Perhaps because this ship
was being scanned

559
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:05,417
for individual
life signs.

560
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:06,583
Apparently when
they are in these slots,

561
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,041
they become
a part of the whole

562
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,834
and no longer read
as separate life-forms.

563
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:36,333
Captain.

564
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:37,333
Go ahead, Number One.

565
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,667
Our readings were incorrect.

566
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,166
The Borg crew survived.

567
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,709
They appear to be
in some kind of stasis.

568
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,875
Picard:
Explain.

569
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:46,792
There are slots along
the wall,

570
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:49,166
kind of like compartments,
there are two Borg in each one.

571
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:52,875
Captain, I would theorize
that the Borg are somehow

572
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,166
interconnected
through these slots,

573
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:55,917
and they are working
collectively.

574
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,875
We're going to try to access
their main computer.

575
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,583
Commander.

576
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,041
I believe each
slot is designed

577
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,917
for a specific Borg.

578
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:17,417
Here is where the
connection is made.

579
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:19,625
Like a juggernaut.

580
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:21,583
It could begin moving
at any moment.

581
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,208
The technology required
to achieve

582
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,083
this biological
and artificial interface

583
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,542
is far beyond
our capabilities.

584
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,041
There are many advantages.

585
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,125
Speed being
the most obvious.

586
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,792
This ship literally
just thinks what it wants,

587
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:35,208
and then it happens.

588
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,041
Fascinating.

589
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:53,917
They either don't see us

590
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,667
or don't see us
as a threat.

591
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,583
Transporter chief.

592
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:38,583
O'Brien here, captain.

593
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:41,083
Picard:
If your fix on the away team
wavers in the slightest,

594
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,625
beam them back immediately.

595
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:44,041
Count on it, sir.

596
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:11,750
Captain,
this is incredible.

597
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:14,542
We've entered what appears
to be the Borg nursery.

598
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:15,834
Picard:
Describe it.

599
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,333
From the look of it,
the Borg are born

600
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,125
as a biological life-form.

601
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,583
It seems...

602
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:43,083
that almost immediately
after birth,

603
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,375
they begin
artificial implants.

604
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:50,667
Apparently the Borg have
developed the technology

605
00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:52,542
to link artificial intelligence
directly

606
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,250
into the humanoid brain.

607
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,208
Astounding.

608
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:06,500
Commander.

609
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,750
What is it?

610
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:16,166
The ship appears
to be regenerating.

611
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:17,667
Perhaps this explains
why they have not

612
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,542
taken notice
of our presence.

613
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:21,333
Their collective effort
is being directed

614
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,000
into repairing this vessel.

615
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,458
Captain.

616
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,458
The Borg seem to be using
their combined power

617
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,458
to repair the ship.

618
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,125
Transporter chief,
beam the away team

619
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,583
directly to the bridge.

620
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,333
Picard:
Let's get the hell
out of here, warp 8.

621
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:39,959
Now, Mr. Crusher, engage.

622
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:52,083
Captain, the Borg
are in pursuit.

623
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,083
On screen.

624
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,291
Picard:
Magnify.

625
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,041
Riker:
Increase to ten
to the third power.

626
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,625
It's continuing
to regenerate.

627
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:11,500
Let's see
if we can out run them.

628
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,583
Mr. LaForge, I want maximum warp

629
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:15,166
for as long as we can hold it.

630
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,542
Yes, sir.

631
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,875
We are now passing warp 8.5.

632
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:26,417
Eight point eight.

633
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,083
Warp 9.

634
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,583
Arm the photon torpedoes.

635
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:30,917
Let's see if we can
slow them down.

636
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,375
Torpedoes armed.

637
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,583
Fire.

638
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:44,709
They had no effect.

639
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,250
Geordi:
Bridge, this is engineering.

640
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:49,417
We are now at warp 9.65.

641
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:51,542
The Borg are
still gaining.

642
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:53,792
They will follow
this ship

643
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,709
until you exhaust
your fuel.

644
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,959
They will wear down
your defenses.

645
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,458
Then you will be theirs.

646
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,625
Admit it, Picard.
You're out of your league.

647
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:04,000
You should have stayed
where you belonged.

648
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:10,709
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

649
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,333
<i>We are unable</i>
<i>to maintain the gap</i>

650
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,542
<i>between the</i> Enterprise

651
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,542
<i>and the Borg ship.</i>

652
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,834
Geordi:
Engineering to bridge.

653
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,375
Go ahead.

654
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:20,625
You've got
all we can give you.

655
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,834
I understand,
Mr. LaForge.

656
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,375
Captain, the enemy vessel
is firing on us.

657
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:34,041
There are no reports
of any damage to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

658
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:37,291
Captain, the target
was not the ship.

659
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,792
The weapon was designed
to drain the shields.

660
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:41,917
Confirmed.
Shield effectiveness

661
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:43,875
has been reduced 12%.

662
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:47,083
Captain, the Borg
ship is closing.

663
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,375
They're firing again.

664
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,583
Shields have been
reduced 41%.

665
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,792
Another hit,
and we will be defenseless.

666
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:00,750
Arm the photon torpedoes.

667
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:02,667
Torpedoes armed.

668
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:04,125
Fire the photons.

669
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:14,417
The Borg ship was not damaged.

670
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,458
You can't outrun them.
You can't destroy them.

671
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,125
If you damage them, the essence
of what they are remains.

672
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,083
They regenerate
and keep coming.

673
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,375
Eventually you
will weaken.

674
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:24,375
Your reserves
will be gone.

675
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:26,458
They are relentless.

676
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:28,750
The Borg ship is firing.

677
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,875
We have lost
shields again.

678
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:46,750
Captain, we've just lost
the warp engines.

679
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:49,834
Q:
Where's your stubbornness
now, Picard, your arrogance?

680
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:51,500
Do you still profess
to be prepared

681
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:53,709
for what awaits you?

682
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,250
The Borg ship is re-establishing
its tractor beam.

683
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,250
Lock on photon torpedoes.

684
00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:00,208
Worf:
Yes, sir.

685
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,083
Without our shields,
at this range

686
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:03,875
there is a high degree
of probability

687
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,375
that a photon detonation

688
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:06,917
could destroy
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

689
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:13,333
Prepare to fire.

690
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,250
I'll be leaving now.

691
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:18,750
Q:
You thought you could
handle it, so handle it.

692
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:20,709
Q.

693
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,750
End this.

694
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:23,417
<i>Moi?</i>

695
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:24,834
What makes you think
I'm either inclined

696
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:27,834
or capable
to terminate this encounter?

697
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:32,875
If we all die here, now,

698
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:34,458
you will not be able
to gloat.

699
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,750
You wanted to frighten us.

700
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:40,875
We are frightened.

701
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:44,125
You wanted to show us
that we were inadequate.

702
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:48,458
For the moment, I grant that.

703
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,375
You wanted me to say
I need you.

704
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:55,000
I<i> need</i> you.

705
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,542
Position?

706
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:20,583
Zero seven zero
mark six three, sir.

707
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,208
Back where we started.

708
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,417
That was
a difficult admission.

709
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:34,500
Another man would have been
humiliated to say those words.

710
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,375
Another man would have rather
died than ask for help.

711
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,083
I understand what
you've done here, Q.

712
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,959
But I think the lesson
could have been learned

713
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,417
without the loss
of 18 members of my crew.

714
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:49,125
If you can't take
a little bloody nose,

715
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:52,166
maybe you ought to go back home
and crawl under your bed.

716
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,000
It's not safe out here.

717
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,375
It's wondrous with treasures

718
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:59,458
to satiate desires
both subtle and gross.

719
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:02,709
But it's not for the timid.

720
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:12,375
Mr. Crusher,

721
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:15,750
set course
for the nearest starbase.

722
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:19,625
Course laid in
for Starbase 83, sir.

723
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,000
Engage.

724
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,583
Q set a series
of events into motion

725
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:42,041
bringing your contact
with the Borg

726
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:44,625
much sooner than
it should have come.

727
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:47,542
Now, perhaps
when you're ready,

728
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:48,667
it might be possible
to establish

729
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:50,750
a relationship with them.

730
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:54,625
But for now,
for right now,

731
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:58,500
you're just
raw material to them.

732
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,208
Since they're aware
of your existence...

733
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:09,000
They will be coming.

734
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:13,083
You can bet on it.

735
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:32,125
Maybe Q did the right thing
for the wrong reason.

736
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:33,542
How so?

737
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:37,125
Well, perhaps
what we most needed

738
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:40,291
was a kick
in our complacency,

739
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:43,333
to prepare us
for what lies ahead.
