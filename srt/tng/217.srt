1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:04,875
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42779.1.</i>

2
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:07,166
<i>We are en route</i>
<i>to the Epsilon IX sector</i>

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:10,709
<i>for an astronomical survey</i>
<i>of a new pulsar cluster.</i>

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,792
<i>In the meantime, Ensign Crusher</i>

5
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:17,542
<i>will be diverting to Starbase</i>
<i>515 for Starfleet exams.</i>

6
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,750
This just came in for
you from Starfleet.

7
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,500
Testing parameters?

8
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:23,125
Do not be apprehensive, Wes.

9
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,959
I found the Academy
examinations

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,250
quite elementary.

11
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,500
You would.

12
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:28,709
Your earlier test results
were good enough

13
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,000
to get you
Academy credit

14
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,250
for your work here.
I don't think you have

15
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,792
anything
to worry about.

16
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:34,625
Those Academy cadets
can be extremely competitive.

17
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,667
But you have
the practical
experience, Wes.

18
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:38,792
Commander Riker
is correct.

19
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:41,417
While the information imparted
to cadets at the Academy

20
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,834
is unquestionably vital

21
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,583
for prospective
Starfleet officers

22
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,333
it, nonetheless, requires
a significant period

23
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,208
of supplementary
systems training

24
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,875
and situational
disciplines.

25
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,208
Didn't I just say that?

26
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,208
Yes, sir

27
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,458
but not quite as perspicuously.

28
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,917
I will not have you
telling me what course to set.

29
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:03,750
As Chief Medical Officer,
I am ordering you to report

30
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:06,000
to Starbase 515 immediately.

31
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,291
Oh, please, I feel fine.

32
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,542
The truth is you've ignored this
far too long.

33
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,625
This ship has a mission
to carry out.

34
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:16,166
An astronomical
survey

35
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,208
to be conducted by the science
officers, I believe.

36
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,709
And I was looking forward

37
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,333
to seeing the Epsilon Pulsar
Cluster for myself.

38
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,542
Then we'll perform
the procedure right here.

39
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,750
Absolutely not.

40
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:34,041
My staff and I are fully capable
of giving you the replacement.

41
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,583
That's not the point.

42
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,375
It would be...

43
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,291
it would be
inappropriate for you

44
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,875
to carry out the procedure.

45
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:46,583
Captain Picard, I had no idea.

46
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,583
You do have an ego, don't you?

47
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,375
Meaning?

48
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:54,291
You're concerned
about your image.

49
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,500
Don't worry.

50
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:59,792
If you get yourself
down to Starbase 515

51
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:02,083
your image will be safe with me.

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,166
Captain, excuse me.

53
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,709
Ensign.

54
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,500
I understand you're leaving
for Starbase 515.

55
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,500
Yes, sir. I was just
going to Shuttle Bay 2.

56
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,500
Good.
I have business there.

57
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:25,542
I shall accompany you.

58
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,709
You will?

59
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,250
I mean, yes, sir.

60
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,208
Prepare the shuttle
for immediate departure.

61
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,750
Aye, sir.

62
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,583
Something I can
take care of for you

63
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,834
on Starbase 515?

64
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,542
Hardly, Number One.

65
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,667
But you'll miss the
Epsilon Pulsar survey.

66
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:41,834
I'm well aware of that fact.

67
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,834
You have the Bridge.

68
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,959
Carry on.

69
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,542
(<i> door chime</i> )

70
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,792
Come.

71
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,208
Yes, what is it, Number One?

72
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,709
Is something wrong?

73
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,375
This trip to Starbase 515
is rather unexpected.

74
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,333
Ensign Crusher and I
will rendezvous with you

75
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,333
on your return
from the Epsilon
Pulsar Cluster.

76
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:11,208
Forgive my saying
so, sir, but you're
being rather enigmatic.

77
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,125
Consider it
Captain's privilege.

78
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,083
As First Officer, I have
complete security clearance.

79
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,500
This has nothing to do with
ship's business, Number One.

80
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:22,000
Suffice it to say, it is
strictly a matter of...

81
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,625
image.

82
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,875
Relax, Wes, you'll
do fine on your exams.

83
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:28,125
Yeah.

84
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,667
It's not my exams
I'm worried about.

85
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,750
It's Captain Picard.

86
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:31,750
Why?

87
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,041
He's not taking the exams.

88
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,667
It's just
the two of us

89
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,208
in a shuttlecraft
for six hours.

90
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,291
What am I going to talk
to Captain Picard about

91
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,667
for six hours?

92
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,709
Oh, archaeology, semantics,
literature, art.

93
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,208
You could learn a lot
from Captain Picard.

94
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,542
LA FORGE:
Ah, Captain Picard.

95
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,583
Nice day for a little trip.

96
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,542
(<i> warning Klaxon sounds</i> )

97
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,000
Shuttle number 2
is ready for departure.

98
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,125
DATA:
The<i> Enterprise</i>
is at impulse speed

99
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,250
and you are cleared for takeoff.

100
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:43,083
RIKER:
Data, wasn't the Captain
looking forward to this mission

101
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,417
to the Epsilon
Pulsar Cluster?

102
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,750
So he said.

103
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:46,917
Then what would make
him change his mind?

104
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,208
Why would he leave
the ship now?

105
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,625
Commander.

106
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,000
Receiving a Mayday
on all frequencies.

107
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,000
Source?

108
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,375
Rhomboid Dronegar sector 006.

109
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:57,500
Detail?

110
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:00,583
Ship, unidentified, distress.

111
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,792
Nothing more.

112
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,208
Set course for Rhomboid
Dronegar 006, warp 7.

113
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,166
Sir, Rhomboid
Dronegar sector
would put us

114
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,291
at considerable distance
from Captain Picard.

115
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,333
I know, Data.

116
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,125
I know.

117
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:39,959
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,917
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

119
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,792
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

120
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:49,750
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

121
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:54,333
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

122
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:58,792
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

123
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,792
Entering Rhomboid
Dronegar sector 006.

124
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,417
I have a ship on target path.

125
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,625
Slow to impulse speed.

126
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:07,625
HELM:
Aye, sir.

127
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:08,750
Viewer.

128
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,959
Deploy shields, sir?

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,959
Hold fast.

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,959
Data?

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,208
Basic early design

132
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,417
capable
of sub-light travel only.

133
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,667
Sir, we are
being hailed.

134
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,208
On screen.

135
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,291
I'm First Officer William Riker
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

136
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,500
We're responding
to your distress signal.

137
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,166
Uh-huh.

138
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,333
What is your problem?

139
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,500
We are far from home.

140
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:39,333
Aren't we all?

141
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,959
But you sent out a Mayday.

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,917
Uh-huh.

143
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,917
Do you need help?

144
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,250
We are Pakleds.

145
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:51,083
Our ship is the<i> Mondor.</i>

146
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,166
It is broken.

147
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,083
We are far from home.

148
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,667
We need help.

149
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:02,667
Let me guess, their rubber band
broke, right?

150
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,625
Sensors indicate
engineering problems.

151
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:08,000
They're experiencing total
guidance system failure

152
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,000
with less than 24
hours reserve power.

153
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,208
Maybe I can help.

154
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,542
What brings you
so far from home?

155
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,834
We look for things.

156
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,458
What were you looking for?

157
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,417
Things we need.

158
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,083
Can you be more specific?

159
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,709
Things that make us go.

160
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,458
We need help.

161
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,959
What is the nature
of your mission?

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We look for things.

163
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,875
Did you hear an echo?

164
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,625
Commander, from the
looks of their ship

165
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:39,709
I can have them up
and running in no time.

166
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,166
You sure?
Yeah, no problem.

167
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,709
Very well.

168
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,709
Our Chief Engineer

169
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,834
will beam over to help you.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,333
Close.

171
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,083
Commander.

172
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,583
Do we truly need to send our
Chief Engineer over to them?

173
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,250
Obviously, they
need our help.

174
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,625
Why do we not simply give them
the information they need

175
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,542
to make
their own repairs?

176
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,417
Do you honestly get the
impression they could

177
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,417
handle our technical
specifications?

178
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,500
We do not know anything
about them.

179
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,458
Acknowledged, Mr. Worf.

180
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,291
We have an obligation
to render aid.

181
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,542
Report to the Transporter Room
with all necessary gear.

182
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,875
Aye, sir.

183
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,208
We need more information.

184
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,750
Do you have
anything else on them?

185
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:28,125
They are
a relatively benign species.

186
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,208
Don't they seem a little slow?

187
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,000
They may merely have
poorly-developed

188
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,667
language skills.

189
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:35,291
What about weapons?

190
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,500
Scanners show limited armaments.

191
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:42,083
I think we can relax, Mr. Worf.

192
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,083
They can't even move their ship
without our help.

193
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,917
We certainly have them outmanned
and outgunned.

194
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,458
ETA 1330 hours, sir.

195
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,834
It's not exactly warp speed.

196
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:10,834
More like a late 22nd century
interplanetary journey.

197
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,792
Sir?

198
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:15,834
You should read
more history, Ensign.

199
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,208
Yes, sir.

200
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,834
Complete waste of time.

201
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,208
Pardon?

202
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,166
I shouldn't be taking
this trip at all.

203
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,291
I should be back
on board the<i> Enterprise.</i>

204
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,000
Why are you coming
with me to Starbase 515, sir?

205
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,625
Well, it's certainly
not my idea.

206
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,750
I'm sorry, Ensign.

207
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:46,458
I didn't mean to
take it out on you.

208
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
I just hate the prospect

209
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:51,917
of another damned
cardiac replacement.

210
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,291
Cardiac replacement?

211
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,291
I didn't know.

212
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,208
Well, now you do.

213
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,417
A parthenogenetic implant?

214
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:07,583
What else would it be?

215
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:12,667
My heart was... injured

216
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:15,291
and a replacement
was necessary.

217
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,583
That would have been it

218
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,667
except that the
replacement is faulty.

219
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:23,834
Why would anyone use
a faulty replacement?

220
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,959
Just pilot the shuttle, Ensign.

221
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,667
Whoa, wait a minute,
wait a minute, it's okay.

222
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,583
I'm here to help.

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,417
We are far from home.

224
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,166
Uh-huh.

225
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,333
Who's, uh, who's
in charge of engineering?

226
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,333
My friend.

227
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,000
His name is Reginod.

228
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,792
Think I could meet him?

229
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:13,917
He is Reginod.

230
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,041
Yes, I think
you mentioned that.

231
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,959
We look for things.

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,750
So I've heard.

233
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:21,917
Can you make
our ship go?

234
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,333
Yes, I think so.

235
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:29,458
We look for things
to make us go.

236
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,792
Fellows, why don't you
just show me

237
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,583
where your guidance
system is, okay?

238
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,208
Excuse me.

239
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,542
He is smart.

240
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,750
Commander...

241
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:00,834
Lieutenant La Forge
is on an alien ship?

242
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,041
Yes, we're rendering assistance
to some curious throwbacks.

243
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,625
How they ever mastered
the rudiments

244
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,000
of space travel is
a genuine curiosity.

245
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:10,291
Commander, those aliens...
what they feel

246
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,208
is not helplessness.

247
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,083
Lieutenant La Forge
is in great danger.

248
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:18,959
He's in danger.

249
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,583
Great danger.

250
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,041
Can you be more specific,
Counselor?

251
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,792
It's not our help
they want.

252
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,291
Well, our help is all
they're going to get.

253
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,542
They can't force us
into anything, can they?

254
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,542
You think
they're weak.

255
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,875
Look at them.

256
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,500
They're certainly
not Jarada or Romulan.

257
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,417
Our Betazoid Counselor
is often aware of things

258
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,250
beyond our
perceptive abilities.

259
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:06,750
Van Doren's technique
has been perfected to 2.4%.

260
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:08,625
Sir?

261
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,583
The cardiac replacement
procedure.

262
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:15,500
It has a very low
mortality rate-- 2.4%.

263
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:18,208
Those are pretty good odds.

264
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm just not overly thrilled
at the prospect

265
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:25,208
of having my innards becoming
the subject of Starfleet gossip.

266
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,583
Of course not, sir.

267
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:34,000
Why didn't you just have Dr.
Pulaski perform the operation?

268
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:38,458
I'm sure you could have
trusted her to keep it quiet.

269
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,792
Let's say I have
personal reasons

270
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:43,375
and leave it
at that, shall we?

271
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,792
The power needs to be rerouted
through this venturi chamber

272
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:57,125
before it can be channeled
to the engine's coils.

273
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,542
(<i> sighs</i> )

274
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,417
It is broken.

275
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,834
Yeah, but not for long.

276
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,458
See, we are going
to reconfigure

277
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,083
these separators
here and over here.

278
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,333
Lieutenant La Forge,
this is Commander Riker.

279
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,333
Come in.

280
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,500
Yes, Commander, go ahead.

281
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,250
Are you all right?

282
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,959
Sure, why do you ask?

283
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,750
Counselor Troi has expressed
misgivings about your absence

284
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:23,834
from the<i> Enterprise.</i>

285
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,375
(<i> laughing</i> )

286
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:27,625
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

287
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,542
Understood.

288
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,959
As soon as you
complete the repairs

289
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,500
I want you back here.
Yes, sir.

290
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:36,041
I should be done
here momentarily.

291
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,709
See, like that.

292
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,834
There.

293
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,041
Your guidance is
now up and running.

294
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,917
Oh, no.
Main power failure?

295
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,667
Will our ship go now?

296
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,917
Well, your guidance
is operational

297
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,792
but you're not
going anywhere.

298
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:13,458
Not with main
power failure.

299
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,583
It is broken.

300
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,709
Can you make it go?

301
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,166
Commander Riker.

302
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,709
I have a problem.

303
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,750
On screen.

304
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:27,583
It looks like this
is going to take

305
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,583
a little bit
longer than I anticipated.

306
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,667
I guess you would have preferred

307
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:49,375
Commander Riker
as a traveling companion.

308
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,417
What?

309
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,709
It's okay.

310
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,250
You're not too comfortable
with me.

311
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,458
I understand.

312
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,291
Ensign...

313
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,166
Wesley, that's not true.

314
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,667
You're a fine young man.

315
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,166
You don't have to say that, sir.

316
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,625
It's pretty obvious
how you feel.

317
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:13,792
Is it?

318
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,166
How so?

319
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,041
Everyone knows.

320
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,875
You don't like kids.

321
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,125
That's too bad.

322
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,500
You might have made
a good father.

323
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Thank you.

324
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,709
Didn't you ever wish
you had kids of your own?

325
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,375
Wishing for a thing
does not make it so.

326
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:10,542
We send him over there
for one set of repairs

327
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,083
and now they need him for more.

328
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,333
Apparently their ship
is quite fragile.

329
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,458
This is Riker
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

330
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,583
Almost got it, Commander.

331
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,417
We look for things.

332
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,959
Apparently, your ship is in need
of more than minor repair.

333
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,750
Things to make it go.

334
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:33,166
We will use our tractor beam
to tow you to the nearest base.

335
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,375
He can make it go.

336
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:37,125
Yes, but we need
our Chief Engineer

337
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,166
back on board our ship.

338
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,458
He is smart.

339
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,875
All done, Commander.

340
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:51,083
Prepare to beam over.

341
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,542
Yes, sir.

342
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,250
You are good.

343
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,667
We aim to please.

344
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,125
We need you.

345
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,375
I'm flattered.

346
00:18:58,417 --> 00:18:59,834
Look, fellas,
I hate to repair and run

347
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,000
but if you'll excuse me.

348
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,709
One to beam aboard.

349
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,375
Hey, don't.

350
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,041
Transporter Room,
beam La Forge back immediately.

351
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,166
TRANSPORTER CHIEF:
Negative response, sir.

352
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,500
Try again.

353
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,041
Negative response.

354
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,166
The Pakled ship
has a shield up, sir.

355
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,542
A shield? What kind?

356
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,500
It appears to be
beyond their technology.

357
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,750
Similar to Romulan shields.

358
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:26,834
Do not interfere
with our transporter beam.

359
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,792
Drop your shields!

360
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,625
Status?

361
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:37,125
Viewer transmission
terminated and blocked.

362
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:49,417
Hail on all frequencies.

363
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,333
Running frequency search.

364
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,417
Negative, sir.

365
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,375
They're ignoring us.

366
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,875
DATA:
Apparently so.

367
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:57,959
Shields up.

368
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,166
Shields up.

369
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,583
Sensors at maximum sensitivity.

370
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,250
Sensors at maximum.

371
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,208
Phasers ready, sir.

372
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,375
Would you care
for some coffee, Ensign?

373
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:19,083
No, thank you, sir.

374
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,500
How about
a sandwich?

375
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,250
I don't think so, sir.

376
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,083
Oh, come on,
it's been hours.

377
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,583
You must be hungry.

378
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,709
Thank you, sir.

379
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:46,625
Here.

380
00:20:57,792 --> 00:20:59,792
Were you ever married?

381
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,250
Never had the time.

382
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,166
Don't you ever get lonely?

383
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,792
For ambitious Starfleet officers

384
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:13,500
there are
certain costs involved.

385
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,250
One must be cautious of
long-term commitments, Wesley.

386
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,000
No problem.

387
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,750
Where women are concerned,
I am in complete control.

388
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:28,125
Really? Hmm.

389
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,000
I always rather had
to work at that.

390
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,667
Have you always been
so disciplined?

391
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:39,500
Good Lord, no.

392
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:42,250
If I was, I wouldn't
have this problem.

393
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,542
I don't understand.

394
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,041
Well...

395
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:53,458
I was a young Starfleet officer

396
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,917
not many years older
than you are now.

397
00:21:56,959 --> 00:22:02,667
Top of my Academy class,
green as hell.

398
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:05,917
And oh, so cocky.

399
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:08,041
Too cocky, as it turned out.

400
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,542
What happened?

401
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,125
Several friends and I
were on leave

402
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,875
at Farspace Starbase Earhart.
It was little more

403
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,333
than a galactic outpost
in those days.

404
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,583
Was this before the Klingons
joined the Federation?

405
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,625
That's right.

406
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,250
Well, my mates and I

407
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:30,625
were at the Bonestell
Recreation Facility

408
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,375
which was
something

409
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,834
of a dead-rough crossroads
at the time

410
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:40,959
filled with an assorted bunch
of galactic riffraff

411
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,959
when...

412
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,333
a trio of Nausicaans came in.

413
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,041
They were clearly spoiling
for a confrontation

414
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,750
with a group of fresh-faced
Starfleet officers

415
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:54,834
such as ourselves.

416
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,458
Well, everyone
in the group had
the good sense

417
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,959
to give these
Nausicaans

418
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,125
a wide berth, stand off.

419
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:03,083
Everyone, that is, except me.

420
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,917
I stood toe-to-toe
with the worst of the three

421
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,959
and I told him
what I thought of him

422
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,542
his pals, his planet

423
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,917
and I possibly made
some passing reference

424
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:14,083
to his questionable parentage

425
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,542
and the next
thing I knew

426
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:20,500
all three of them were on me
and I was fighting for my life.

427
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:24,208
I was actually doing quite well
for a while, too.

428
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,083
You fought them and won?

429
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:30,750
I had this one Nausicaan down

430
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:33,792
in this somewhat devious
joint-lock

431
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:35,625
when, unbeknownst to me

432
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:40,625
one of his chums drew his weapon
and impaled me through the back.

433
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:44,333
Curious sensation actually.

434
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,000
Not much pain.

435
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,625
Shock, certainly

436
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:53,750
at the sight of serrated metal
sticking through my chest.

437
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,166
A certain giddy warmth.

438
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,083
In fact, I do
actually remember

439
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,709
that I laughed out loud.

440
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,083
Well, it pierced my heart,
of course.

441
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,917
Well, if we'd not been so near
to a medical facility

442
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:11,000
I would surely have died.

443
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,208
Really?

444
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,542
Then what happened?

445
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,542
Nothing.

446
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,917
I was no hero,
Wesley.

447
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:24,458
I was an undisciplined,
loud-mouthed

448
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:30,208
opinionated young man
who was way out of his league.

449
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,458
I learned a very hard,
very painful lesson that day

450
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
but I learned it well.

451
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,583
I hope you never have
to learn it the same way.

452
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:45,250
Care for another sandwich?

453
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,000
Please.

454
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,208
Come on, Data.

455
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,208
I am programming the com system

456
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,542
to scan
the interference patterns

457
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:09,625
but a full analysis
will take time.

458
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:17,458
Hey, you be careful
with that thing.

459
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,834
You want
to hurt us.

460
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:21,500
What?

461
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:23,542
I came here to help you.

462
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:24,834
We can make more.

463
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,375
PAKLED CAPTAIN:
Make more weapons.

464
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,834
Wait a minute.

465
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,083
You have a replicator?

466
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,750
It is not broken.

467
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,875
I didn't come here
to give you weapons.

468
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:41,417
You will make more.

469
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,250
(<i> sighs</i> )

470
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:50,166
Commander, a photon torpedo
may penetrate their shield.

471
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:53,083
Any hostile move on our part
could jeopardize Geordi.

472
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:56,208
Agreed, but what
do the Pakleds want?

473
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,041
Counselor?

474
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:01,417
They have what they want,
for now.

475
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,959
We're approaching
Starbase 515, sir.

476
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:16,291
At last.

477
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,291
Did you read that book
I gave you?

478
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,917
Some of it.

479
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,959
That's reassuring.

480
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,583
I just don't
have much time.

481
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:42,291
There's no
greater challenge

482
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,542
than the study
of philosophy.

483
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,333
But William James won't
be on my Starfleet exams.

484
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:50,750
The important things
never will be.

485
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:53,208
Anyone can be trained

486
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,500
in the mechanics
of piloting a starship.

487
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:58,667
But Starfleet Academy...

488
00:26:58,709 --> 00:26:59,959
It takes more.

489
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,291
Open your mind to the past--
art, history

490
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,792
philosophy--

491
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,375
and all this may mean something.

492
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,709
It's all deception.

493
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,500
Nothing the Pakleds
have said or done
has been sincere.

494
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:24,875
Intensified scan shows
their guidance system

495
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:28,667
to be perfectly intact,
as is their power generator.

496
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:31,333
Then what was Geordi repairing?

497
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:33,542
Apparently,
the putative malfunctions

498
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,875
were carefully programmed
into their ship's computer.

499
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:38,458
I didn't think the Pakleds
had that kind of technology.

500
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,125
They seem to have made
some technological
leaps forward, Commander.

501
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:44,667
Why would they go
through this charade
of needing our help?

502
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,291
For the sole purpose

503
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,458
of making Lieutenant
La Forge their prisoner.

504
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:58,083
<i>Captain's Personal Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42779.5.</i>

505
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:01,125
<i>We have arrived</i>
<i>at Starbase 515.</i>

506
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,959
<i>I'm still quite uneasy,</i>
<i>despite assurances</i>

507
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,834
<i>that this medical procedure</i>
<i>poses little risk.</i>

508
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:11,041
I hope you won't be
late for your exams.

509
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,458
Oh, I still have
some time, sir.

510
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:17,250
Why do I get
the distinct impression

511
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,250
that you're acting
like some kind of escort?

512
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:23,291
Dr. Pulaski asked me

513
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:27,417
to make sure that you
actually went inside.

514
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,291
That woman.

515
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,291
She would.

516
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,083
Sir?

517
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,000
Yes, what is it, Ensign?

518
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:37,041
I enjoyed
our trip together, sir.

519
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:40,417
So did I.

520
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:51,166
They are initiating
visual contact, sir.

521
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:53,291
Maybe now we'll find out
what they really want.

522
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:56,333
<i>Enterprise.</i>

523
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:59,750
We demand that you return
our crew member immediately.

524
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:01,291
Request denied.

525
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,291
Lower your shields.

526
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,375
Request denied.

527
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,750
Stop it!

528
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,834
What do you want?

529
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,458
You think we are not smart.

530
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,458
I think you need
to continue to develop.

531
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,834
We are smart.

532
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,583
Prove it.

533
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:27,375
Return our man to us.

534
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:29,000
You want him?

535
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:31,625
Yes, damn it.

536
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,959
Good.

537
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,542
We want all computer information
from your ship.

538
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,041
Now.

539
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,417
We've got a man held hostage
by alien forces

540
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,542
and all I have
are no-option options.

541
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,834
I need some input.

542
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,667
Is Geordi all right?

543
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:01,709
He's already been hit

544
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,500
by multiple phaser stuns.

545
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,542
He could need
medical attention.

546
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:08,000
Security team stands ready
to take the initiative, sir.

547
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,291
Data?

548
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,959
Our options have not changed.

549
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,166
We can either respond
to the Pakled demand or not.

550
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,875
We can either use force or not.

551
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,834
RIKER:
Allowing them access
to our computer

552
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:21,041
is a complete breach
of Starfleet security.

553
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,375
Then force it must be.

554
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,917
Don't worry about
a thing, Captain.

555
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,750
We've done this
a hundred times

556
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:40,834
and we're ready
when you are.

557
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,291
Just get on with it, Doctor.

558
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,000
I have work to do.

559
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:46,625
Activate sterile field.

560
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,333
Neural calipers.

561
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:02,667
This will be a secondary
cardiac procedure

562
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:03,917
with mid-line entry

563
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:06,667
and excision of the
early model unit.

564
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:10,291
I anticipate no complications,
as the patient

565
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:11,834
has had positive
primary results

566
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,792
and exhibits extraordinary
physical condition.

567
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:17,542
We'll all be home
in time for dinner.

568
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,375
Tissue mitigator.

569
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:23,875
(<i> instrument hums softly</i> )

570
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:27,208
There is limited information
available on the Pakled culture

571
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,291
but the eclectic range
of their equipment

572
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,417
suggests that their technology
was borrowed from others.

573
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,375
And now they have
become militant.

574
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:35,458
So it would seem.

575
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,959
Rationale?

576
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,792
They're unwilling to wait
for the timely evolution

577
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:43,166
of their species'
intellectual capacity.

578
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:47,500
They want instant knowledge,
instant power and gratification.

579
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:49,250
The more they get,
the more they want.

580
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:52,250
And the more aggressive
and dangerous they become.

581
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:54,291
I think it's time
we set some limits.

582
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,625
To what effect, sir?

583
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:58,417
We are faced
with an impossible conundrum.

584
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,792
Suppose we turn their impatience
and greed against them.

585
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:02,792
But how?

586
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,125
Perhaps Geordi should

587
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:05,291
give them something they want.

588
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,041
Something important.

589
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,250
Then we simply create the right
moment for him to take it away

590
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:12,250
and get him
the hell out of there.

591
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:14,667
Would you be suggesting a ruse
of some sort?

592
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:16,250
I would.

593
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:18,208
But what if we fail?

594
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,083
What'll happen
to Geordi then?

595
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,834
We have no other choice.

596
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,542
We have to try.

597
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:32,000
There's been some
capillary reaction here.

598
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:34,792
Let's proceed carefully.

599
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,375
We'll need sharper focus

600
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:38,291
on the thoracic
polychromatics

601
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:42,667
and verification
of myocardial enzyme balance.

602
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:50,125
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

603
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:54,542
Hey, let me talk to them.

604
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:57,041
I'll get you their
computer banks.

605
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,709
We want to be smart.

606
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,375
So open the hailing frequency.

607
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,083
They'll listen to me.

608
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,792
We are smart.

609
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:08,792
We need
their computer things.

610
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:10,834
Yes.

611
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,125
Yes.

612
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,709
Commander Riker?

613
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,375
Yes, Lieutenant.
We're here.

614
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:20,625
The Pakleds seem
pretty sincere.

615
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,458
We want what we want.

616
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,625
Our computer banks
are non-negotiable.

617
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,083
We want them.

618
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:30,041
Believe me, they're
nothing if not persistent.

619
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:33,291
We want to be nothing
if not persistent.

620
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:36,625
Nobody ever said
they were great
conversationalists.

621
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:39,125
Where did they
get their shields?

622
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,000
Yes, we like shields.

623
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:45,125
Well, from what I've
seen, half the systems
onboard the ship

624
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:48,166
have been stolen from the
Romulans, Klingons, Jarada--

625
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,083
just about anyone they've
ever come in contact with.

626
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,417
We like to be smart.

627
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,834
Confirmed, Lieutenant La Forge.

628
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:57,792
They steal technology.

629
00:33:57,834 --> 00:34:00,542
But they lack the ability
to use it properly.

630
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:04,709
You're an excellent Chief
Engineer, Lieutenant La Forge.

631
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,250
Thank you, sir.

632
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:08,166
And of course
your knowledge of phaser

633
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,709
and photon weaponry
is unmatched.

634
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,583
That's nice of
you to say, sir

635
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,625
but... it's really
Lieutenant Worf that...

636
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,250
Our missions
are always inherently dangerous

637
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,875
and any of us
could be called upon

638
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:21,000
to make the ultimate sacrifice

639
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,083
at any time.

640
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,166
Well, yes, sir, but...

641
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,959
Speaking of time

642
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,875
this may be your time.

643
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:31,375
I shall personally miss you.

644
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:33,917
DATA:
Good-bye, Geordi.

645
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:37,041
I shall miss you
at weapons systems analysis.

646
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,417
Uh-huh.

647
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:42,500
Uh... and I guess
you'll just have to arm

648
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:44,542
your photon torpedoes
without me.

649
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,875
As well as our hydrogen
collectors.

650
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:49,875
Fond farewell.

651
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:52,500
He knows about weapons.

652
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:54,709
You can make us strong.

653
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,834
Well, it's not something that
I really like to talk about.

654
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,709
WORF:
Any classified weapons knowledge

655
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,792
you share with your captors
will be considered treason.

656
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:03,583
But I may have no choice.

657
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,250
You will die without honor.

658
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:08,792
Thanks a lot, Worf.

659
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:12,208
You will never attain
the 24th level of awareness.

660
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,166
24, huh?

661
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,417
That's, uh...

662
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,000
That's quite a challenge.

663
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,375
Indeed.

664
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:22,208
24 is the gateway
to heroic salvation.

665
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,875
Do you think
he understands?

666
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,083
He'd better.

667
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,834
He's afraid.

668
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:34,458
We all are, Counselor.

669
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:41,542
You are smart.

670
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,083
Not smart enough.

671
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,041
I'm still here.

672
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,208
Make us strong.

673
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,208
I thought you wanted me
to help you go?

674
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,083
Why don't we work
on that guidance system, okay?

675
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,583
Make us strong.

676
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,667
Or die.

677
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

678
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:06,625
(<i> instrument beeps loudly</i> )

679
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,083
SURGEON:
It's not working.

680
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,917
Something's wrong.

681
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,500
The metabilation occlusions
aren't holding.

682
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:19,417
Damn it, I can't stop
the heterocyclic declination.

683
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:20,375
Fuse!

684
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:22,083
(<i> buzzing</i> )

685
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,792
Again!

686
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:26,000
(<i> buzzing</i> )

687
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:32,083
We need a biomolecular
physiologist in here.

688
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,834
This man is dying.

689
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,291
Right away, sir.

690
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,500
LA FORGE:
You've got to be kidding.

691
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:56,041
Make us strong.

692
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,709
Come on, there's not
enough juice in these

693
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,417
to blow off a passing asteroid.

694
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:02,458
Do it.
Make us strong.

695
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,625
I suppose we could increase
the anti-matter charges.

696
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:09,208
Yes. We like power.

697
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:11,667
Yeah.

698
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:13,375
PAKLED CAPTAIN:
Do not try to trick us.

699
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:16,041
We can tell.

700
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,959
Metabilation?

701
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,333
Negative.

702
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,583
Heterocyclics?

703
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:37,875
Failing.

704
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:40,917
And capillary integrity
too unpredictable

705
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,583
to attempt a resect.

706
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:44,709
You're unwilling
to make the attempt?

707
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:48,291
I'm not qualified.

708
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:51,333
I know someone who is.

709
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,250
Are you sure he can do it, sir?

710
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:00,834
I mean, Geordi's an engineer,
not a weapons specialist.

711
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,834
If anyone can improvise,
it's Geordi.

712
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,208
Well, what makes you think

713
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,083
the Pakleds even have
that kind gear on board?

714
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,375
Ongoing scanning

715
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:09,875
indicates progressive
weapons potential.

716
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:11,417
The timing will be crucial.

717
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,667
Geordi must correctly
interpret our intentions.

718
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,458
Geordi's up to speed.
I trust his instincts.

719
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,583
The Pakled did hear
our little fiction

720
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,458
about Geordi's
weapons knowledge.

721
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,333
Exactly, and since they
equate intelligence
with strength

722
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,583
they won't pass
up the chance to
use that knowledge.

723
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:25,792
Can you do it?

724
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:26,917
Count on it.

725
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:29,917
WORF:
Bridge to Commander Riker.

726
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,250
Go ahead, Bridge.

727
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:33,125
I am receiving
an emergency summons

728
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:35,041
from Starbase 515.

729
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:36,250
Captain Picard

730
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:38,625
is close to death.

731
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,083
Be ready.

732
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,041
We are strong.

733
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,208
You are armed
to the teeth.

734
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,083
Teeth are for chewing.

735
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,917
You have photon torpedo.

736
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:01,750
You are strong.

737
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:03,667
We are strong.

738
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:05,709
We have power.

739
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:13,750
Positive indication of armed
photon torpedoes, Commander.

740
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,250
Geordi did it.

741
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:17,542
Starbase requests
we proceed to base

742
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:18,542
at warp 9.

743
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:19,917
We've got to go.

744
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:21,709
Yes, the Captain needs our help.

745
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,750
We can't leave
Geordi behind.

746
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,875
I want the Pakleds on that
screen, and I want them now.

747
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:29,625
Forced spectrum
communication is
spotty at best, sir.

748
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,875
Do it.

749
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:33,917
This is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

750
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:37,166
Return our personnel
or face immediate reprisal.

751
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,834
We are strong now.

752
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,208
We have better weapons.

753
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,333
Are you prepared to use them?

754
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,000
We are a force now.

755
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:48,458
We will have respect, power.

756
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,792
We don't have time for this.

757
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:52,250
You want power?
Here's power.

758
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,208
Riker to Ensign Gomez.

759
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,875
Ready, Commander Riker.

760
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:58,041
Prepare firing sequence.

761
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:01,000
Start firing countdown from 24.

762
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,625
I can't believe it.

763
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,625
My friends, my people,
they're trying to kill us.

764
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:05,792
Kill<i> me!</i>

765
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:06,792
Believe it.

766
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:08,041
They are violent.

767
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:09,375
Okay, they want
to play rough--

768
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:10,458
that's fine with me.

769
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,750
Just let me check something.

770
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:16,583
Good, he is on
our side now.

771
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:19,959
RIKER:
Begin firing sequence.

772
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,375
COMPUTER:
Twenty-four.

773
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:22,709
Twenty-three.

774
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,125
Twenty-two.

775
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:26,750
Twenty-one.

776
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:27,792
Twenty.

777
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:29,125
Firing sequence
proceeding, sir.

778
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:30,125
Hold fast.

779
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:31,500
Eighteen.

780
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:33,542
Seventeen.

781
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:34,792
Sixteen.

782
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:35,875
Fifteen.

783
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:38,166
Don't do anything yet.

784
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:39,417
Thirteen.

785
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:40,667
What are you doing?

786
00:40:40,709 --> 00:40:42,291
Making sure your systems
are operative.

787
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:44,000
We will attack.

788
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,750
We are strong.

789
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:46,917
Nine.

790
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:48,458
Eight.

791
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,750
Seven.

792
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:52,041
Six.

793
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,625
Five.

794
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,125
We should attack now.

795
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,208
Just another second.
We can't afford a misfire here.

796
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,208
Two.

797
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,208
Hurry.

798
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,291
One.

799
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,917
Fire.

800
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:06,667
Now!

801
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,959
Oh, no,
it's too late.

802
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,417
We have fired.

803
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:12,917
They will be destroyed.

804
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:15,250
They used their
crimson force field.

805
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:17,291
It did not shoot.

806
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:21,750
No, the crimson force field
has disarmed us.

807
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:23,542
They are smart.

808
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:26,583
We are not strong.

809
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,250
RIKER:
Drop your shields.

810
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:31,250
Allow us to transport
Lieutenant La Forge immediately.

811
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,709
Shields are down, sir.

812
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,750
Transporter Room,
beam one to the Bridge.

813
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,458
Aye, sir.

814
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:52,291
Set heading
for Starbase 515, warp 9.

815
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:55,000
Blowing that hydrogen
exhaust through the
Bussard collector

816
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:56,375
sure put on a
nice light show.

817
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:58,000
Harmless but effective.

818
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,750
Were you able
to disable the photons?

819
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:00,875
Just in time.

820
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,583
That's why
you're still here.

821
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:15,041
ANESTHESIOLOGIST:
Deactivating neural calipers.

822
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:41,792
What in the hell
are you doing here?

823
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:45,959
Saving your life.

824
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:49,875
Oh, come on.

825
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:52,583
This is a routine procedure.

826
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,375
Quite commonplace.

827
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:56,000
True.

828
00:42:56,041 --> 00:43:00,375
But you are not
a commonplace man.

829
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:05,542
You'll be out of recovery
in four hours.

830
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,458
I didn't want you
involved in this.

831
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,792
You're welcome.

832
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:17,542
If you're here,
the entire crew must know.

833
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:20,542
You're still the Captain.

834
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,375
Invincible.

835
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:25,917
Huh. Thank you.

836
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:45,125
I beg your pardon.

837
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:48,083
Looks like things are
back to normal.

838
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,959
I'm pleased to report

839
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,125
that Ensign Crusher's
Starfleet exam results

840
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:53,709
permit him
to continue his studies

841
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,291
onboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

842
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:59,583
Furthermore, any rumors
of my brush with death

843
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:00,750
are greatly exaggerated.

844
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:02,125
Is that clear?

845
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,917
Yes, sir.

846
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:09,625
Then, Ensign Crusher, set course
for the Epsilon sector, warp 5.

847
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:11,834
Engage.
