00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:06,834
PICARD:
Commander Riker,
report to the Bridge.

2
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:08,083
On the way.

3
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,333
MAN:
Harry, Harry,
come back here!

4
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:14,709
(<i> grunts</i> )

5
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:16,625
What's your hurry, Harry?

6
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,041
Oops.
Sorry, Commander.

7
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,166
I was just...

8
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:23,583
Harry!

9
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,250
I'm sorry
if he bothered you.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,291
No bother,
Dr. Bernard.

11
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,083
I'm not
going back.

12
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,000
I hate that teacher,
and I hate calculus.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,208
Everyone needs
an understanding
of basic calculus--

14
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,667
whether they
like it or not.

15
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,166
Why?

16
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:49,041
(<i> console beeping</i> )

17
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,250
BEVERLY:
You're limping.

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,542
I had a small run-in
with an aspiring sprinter.

19
00:00:57,542 --> 00:00:58,500
Number One.

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,542
Problem, Captain?

21
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:00,667
More a curiosity.

22
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:01,959
For the past few hours

23
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,291
we've been tracking
faint energy readings

24
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,291
in an attempt
to locate its source.

25
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,625
It's like following
a trail of bread crumbs.

26
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,375
The path finally led us here
and then stopped--

27
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,959
which is what I knew
would interest you.

28
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,291
What's our position, Geordi?

29
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:18,625
The Epsilon
Mynos system, sir.

30
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,917
RIKER:
Thank you, Captain.
you're right.

31
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:21,583
I wouldn't miss this
for anything.

32
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,250
What's so interesting
about this system?

33
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,375
Aldea.

34
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,834
Tasha, I'm surprised you haven't
heard the stories of Aldea--

35
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,625
the wondrous,
mythical world

36
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,125
like Atlantis
of ancient Earth

37
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,166
or Neinman of Xerxes VII--

38
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:40,709
advanced culture, centuries old,
self-contained, peaceful

39
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,583
incredible technical
sophistication

40
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,875
providing the daily
needs of all the citizens

41
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,250
so that they could turn
themselves over

42
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,291
to art and culture.

43
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,625
Where's it
supposed to be?

44
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,834
That's the myth.

45
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:52,834
Somehow, as the legend goes

46
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:54,625
the Aldeans were
able to cloak

47
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,125
their planet
in darkness

48
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,125
and go unseen
by marauders

49
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,917
and other
hostile passersby

50
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,875
who might rob
and plunder.

51
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,458
YAR:
What a wonderful
fairy tale.

52
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,667
Scanners still show
nothing, sir.

53
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:08,959
Scanners may
show nothing, sir

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,166
but I'm sensing
something very strong--

55
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,792
thousands of minds.

56
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:16,375
From where?

57
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,792
Very close.

58
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:27,792
All stop
and hold this position.

59
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:29,583
Aye, sir.

60
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,375
All stop

61
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,667
and hold.

62
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:36,417
Anything?

63
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:38,375
Captain, I'm recording
a distortion

64
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,667
in Quadrant 1, mark, 9-0.

65
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,166
On screen.

66
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,083
(<i> screen beeps</i> )

67
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,375
Shields and
deflectors up.

68
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,000
Aye, sir.
(<i> console beeps</i> )

69
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,250
It's Aldea, Captain.

70
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,834
It has to be.

71
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:37,750
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

72
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,083
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

73
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,667
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

78
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:05,125
<i>Either by chance or intent</i>

79
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,333
<i>we've been led</i>

80
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,959
<i>which appeared out of nowhere</i>

81
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,125
<i>hidden behind a sophisticated</i>
<i>shielding device.</i>

82
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:16,417
Sensors indicate
that the shield is
electromagnetic--

83
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,750
a complicated light-
refracting mechanism.

84
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,834
A cloaking device.

85
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:21,917
Aye, sir.

86
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,125
It's got to be
pretty sophisticated

87
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,125
to hide
an entire planet.

88
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,333
We're being
scanned, sir.

89
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,333
Hmm. We'll let them know
our peaceful intention.

90
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,417
Open hailing frequencies,
Lieutenant Yar.

91
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:34,500
Frequencies open, sir.

92
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,166
I am Rashella.

93
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,375
Welcome to Aldea.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,583
I, uh...
(<i> clears throat</i> )

95
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,875
I am Jean-Luc Picard,
Captain of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

96
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,792
We come in peace.

97
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,667
We know.

98
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,458
We've heard stories about Aldea

99
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:58,333
but, frankly, I never
believed they could be true.

100
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,375
Our shield has confused
outsiders

101
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,792
for millennia, Captain.

102
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:06,667
That's a very long time
to have such technology.

103
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:09,333
Why do you reveal
yourselves to us now?

104
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,000
We are eager to meet in person
to discuss that

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,250
and other subjects
of mutual interest.

106
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,875
We're ready anytime.

107
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,250
Excellent.

108
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:23,000
(<i> screen beeps off,</i>
<i>alarm sounds</i> )

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,375
We mean no harm.

110
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,250
Our arrival seems
to have startled you.

111
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,000
It was a little sudden.

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm Radue--

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,834
First Appointee
to Aldea.

114
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,291
Welcome aboard.

115
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,000
Captain, they haven't been
through decontamination.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,166
PICARD:
Our medical doctor
is concerned

117
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,291
that you didn't
go through

118
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,667
the regular transporting
procedure.

119
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,458
You couldn't
transport us.

120
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,083
The only way through
our shield is our way, Captain.

121
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,834
Our cloaking
device may be off

122
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:55,291
but our shield
is operating.

123
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,083
We've brought you
small tokens of welcome.

124
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,667
And a personal
invitation

125
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,458
to a celebration
on Aldea.

126
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,208
That would be
delightful.

127
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,709
Number One,
assemble the away team.

128
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:06,959
We will prepare

129
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,041
for your arrival,
Commander Riker.

130
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,041
How do you know...?

131
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,667
...your name?

132
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:17,542
Well, we've been monitoring
your ship's communications.

133
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:19,375
We must now
return to Aldea.

134
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,542
Our eyes are very sensitive
to the bright light.

135
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,208
Rashella.

136
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,667
(<i> device beeping</i> )

137
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,208
Amazing!

138
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,208
To exist only
in that dream world of mythology

139
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,667
and then suddenly to be here,
right in front of us.

140
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,917
Now we know
who placed the bread crumbs.

141
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,542
We're not here by accident.

142
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,291
Counselor,
do you sense anything?

143
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:46,667
They want something from us--
something we value greatly--

144
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:50,667
so much, that they're afraid
we won't part with it.

145
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,291
(<i> communications beep</i> )

146
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,667
RADUE:
We're ready to receive you,
Commander Riker

147
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,959
and two of your colleagues.

148
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,750
Interesting choices.

149
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,208
I hope that Duana and I
know how

150
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,291
to greet you properly,
Commander.

151
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,291
How do they
cloak the planet?

152
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,917
The theory is simple--

153
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,667
the shield bends light rays
around the planet's contour--

154
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:25,792
similar to the Romulan
cloaking device

155
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,917
but the implementation
is quite difficult.

156
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,291
WORF:
Captain!

157
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,625
Data, what do you read?

158
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,291
Some sort of
scanning device, sir.

159
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,500
PICARD:
Don't touch him!

160
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,000
This beam is emanating
from Aldea.

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,959
Shields up. La Forge,
contact Commander Riker.

162
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:41,000
Worf, check all decks.

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,583
Shields inoperable, sir.

164
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,625
All decks being probed
in a methodical pattern, sir.

165
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,917
All decks, everywhere--
the entire ship?

166
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:47,208
DATA:
Aye, sir.

167
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,291
LA FORGE:
Can't reach the Commander--

168
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,458
we're being blocked.

169
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,041
Wesley, are you all right?

170
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,875
It was scary
at first

171
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,667
but I didn't really
feel anything.

172
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,166
WORF:
Sir, similar incidents,
all decks...

173
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,166
but only with the children.

174
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,250
Yes, we are an ancient
power, Commander

175
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,041
but we've suffered for it.

176
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,625
Our history is littered
with the deaths

177
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,250
of those Aldeans who wanted
more and more<i> things.</i>

178
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,792
Nothing was ever enough

179
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:25,500
so we've evolved a very
simple way of living--

180
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,041
for whatever is
taken, something
is given in return.

181
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,917
That seems
an equitable code.

182
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:33,500
Hmm, it's brought us peace.

183
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,125
Unfortunately, there are very
few of us left to enjoy it.

184
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,458
Why?

185
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,333
That is part of what
we wish to discuss.

186
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:47,417
We need help from the Federation
to rebuild our heritage.

187
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:51,000
We need a younger generation,
strong and healthy

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,959
following in
the Aldean traditions.

189
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,625
I don't understand.
How can the Federation

190
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,250
help influence<i> your</i> children
in<i> your</i> traditions?

191
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,667
Because we have no children,
Commander.

192
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,667
Rashella was the last child
born on this planet.

193
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,750
And your medical community
can do nothing?

194
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,834
They've tried, Dr. Crusher,
and failed.

195
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:21,000
Perhaps we can help.

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,417
Radue, exactly why
were we invited here?

197
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:25,959
We propose a trade:

198
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,542
one which would solve
our problem

199
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:29,917
and give something back
to the Federation.

200
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:33,208
And the nature
of this trade?

201
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,041
We need some of your children.

202
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,083
In payment, we will
give you information

203
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,208
that would take you
centuries to acquire.

204
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,333
That might be acceptable
to some other races

205
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:51,333
but, uh, humans are unusually
attached to their offspring.

206
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,834
Our children are not for sale
at any price.

207
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,250
RIKER:
We sympathize
with your situation

208
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,458
but what you ask
is not possible.

209
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,250
And that's your final answer?

210
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,542
That's my only answer.

211
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,625
Now, if there's
some other way

212
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,917
that we could
help you...

213
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,792
I'm sorry you are
so intransigent.

214
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:15,834
(<i> high-pitched tone</i> )

215
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,333
Still no response, sir.

216
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,959
(<i> beeping</i> )

217
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,166
Wesley!

218
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,375
They've taken my son.

219
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,000
Alexandra!

220
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,709
Alexandra!

221
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,250
(<i> plucking notes</i> )

222
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,250
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

223
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,333
Captain, saucer section reports
six more children are gone.

224
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,875
It's the children.

225
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,834
That's why we've
been brought here.

226
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,000
That's what they wanted.

227
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,375
And that's what
they have!

228
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,542
Status?

229
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:06,750
Aldean shields still up.

230
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,500
Hailing frequencies open;
no response.

231
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,875
Keep trying.

232
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,709
Counselor, you'll have
to gather the parents.

233
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:13,542
They'll need to speak
to you as well, Captain.

234
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:16,000
(<i> communications beep</i> )
RADUE:
Captain,

235
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,125
your children
are with us.

236
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:23,500
My word of honor--
no harm will ever come to them.

237
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,667
Harm has already
come to them.

238
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,542
Captain, let us begin
discussions

239
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:31,083
regarding appropriate
compensation.

240
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,083
Compensation?

241
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,208
You have stolen our children
away from...

242
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,250
away from their classrooms,
away from their bedrooms

243
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,792
and you talk about compensation!

244
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,500
You claim to be
a civilized world

245
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,291
and yet you've just committed
an act of utter barbarity!

246
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,750
Captain, we will continue
these discussions

247
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,375
when you've calmed down.

248
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,917
Wesley, I'm frightened.

249
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,834
I know you
are, Katie--

250
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,583
we all are--

251
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,125
but we're going
to be all right.

252
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,667
Everyone knows
where we are

253
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,208
and no one is
going to hurt you.

254
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,375
I promise.

255
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,000
(<i> door opens</i> )

256
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:21,667
Greetings

257
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,875
Wesley Crusher.

258
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,041
The Custodian indicated
that you would be the leader.

259
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,875
The Custodian?

260
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,375
Who is The Custodian?

261
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,417
The Custodian is not a person.

262
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:34,875
RASHELLA:
You have been
brought to Aldea

263
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,417
as our guests.

264
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:39,625
We'll provide anything
you need or want.

265
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,375
We want to go home.

266
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:46,875
Wesley, all of you have been
chosen because you are special.

267
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,875
Just ask for
anything you want

268
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,667
and you shall have it.

269
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,291
What's happened to Alexandra
and the other children, Captain?

270
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,333
How are you
getting them back?

271
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,917
Toya, sit down.

272
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,125
Don't give in
to fear.

273
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,917
Now, we all knew
what the risks were
when we signed on

274
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,166
and that's the
choice we made.

275
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,333
Now, Captain Picard will
do everything possible

276
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,959
to bring our
children back.

277
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,458
The Aldeans are anxious
to discuss compensation.

278
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,875
Compensation?

279
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,500
That will buy us time.

280
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,792
I've asked Dr. Crusher

281
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,875
to be involved
in these negotiations

282
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,917
as your representative.

283
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,458
Why were these specific
children taken?

284
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,792
We can't be sure.

285
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:47,000
We do know the Aldeans can't
have children of their own.

286
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,458
Then they won't
let them go easily.

287
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:54,166
I won't insult you by pretending
that any of this will be easy.

288
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,875
But I can tell you
that the<i> Enterprise</i>

289
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,083
will not leave them behind.

290
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,750
You can be assured of that.

291
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,875
Can we talk
with our children

292
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,000
give them some
reassurance

293
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,375
let them know
that we are here

294
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,500
and that they
will be safe?

295
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,542
I'll do my best
to arrange that.

296
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,959
The last time I saw him,
I yelled at him.

297
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,667
There you are!

298
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,458
I have you now!

299
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:42,583
Come in.

300
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,041
Don't be alarmed.

301
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,208
The other children have been
assigned to their units.

302
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,709
Units?

303
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:50,417
A unit is a group
where those of similar talents

304
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,417
and interests live together.

305
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:55,125
Do you mean
like a family?

306
00:15:55,125 --> 00:16:00,375
RADUE:
Yes, you could
call it that.

307
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,709
We already
have families.

308
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,125
Does Captain Picard
know you're doing this?

309
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,041
We keep nothing
from him.

310
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,625
We've been waiting
for you so long, Harry.

311
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,667
We are artists,
just like you.

312
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:22,166
We see within you the potential
of what you can be.

313
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,083
I'm not an artist.

314
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,667
You will be

315
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,667
and a great one.

316
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,417
This way, Harry.

317
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,250
Unit B, three, seven, five.

318
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,333
Katie.

319
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,041
I am honored.

320
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,458
Thank you.

321
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,625
Melian is the foremost
musician on Aldea.

322
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,250
Music speaks
its own language.

323
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,834
I know we'll have
much to learn

324
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:59,208
from each other.

325
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,291
Don't worry, Katie.

326
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,041
You'll be seeing
Wesley soon.

327
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:09,709
What about me?

328
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,500
Don't I get
a say in this?

329
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,041
Wesley, sometimes
something happens

330
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:18,500
which you just must accept.

331
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,667
You and the
other children

332
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,083
are now members
of this society.

333
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,375
That will not change.

334
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,208
It is up to you
to make the transition

335
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,000
as easy as possible
for the others.

336
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,500
It's your duty,
because you are their leader.

337
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,166
Help them to accept it.

338
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,583
Because nothing you

339
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:39,000
or those on the starship
can do can change it.

340
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,333
Because, like you,
we also have no choice.

341
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,625
(<i> laughter</i> )

342
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,041
Where have you
been, Rashella?

343
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,583
Zena and Aran
are waiting to
take Alexandra.

344
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,959
No.

345
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:57,709
No? I told you that she...

346
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,291
No, Radue.

347
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,667
They can't have her.

348
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,834
I will never let her go.

349
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,792
Any response from Aldea,
Lieutenant?

350
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,166
Not yet, sir.

351
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:19,083
Captain, Data has found
something interesting.

352
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,458
The Aldean shield
gives evidence of
random fluctuations

353
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,125
weakening its structure
in isolated sections.

354
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,166
Are you saying
that there are holes

355
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,166
in their defense system?

356
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,583
In essence, yes.

357
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,166
I find it surprising that
after all these eons

358
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,667
the Aldeans have
not perfected
their technology.

359
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:34,750
One would assume,
they'd be aware

360
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,417
of the weakness
and repair it.

361
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:39,000
Could we beam an away team
through one of those holes?

362
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,125
It's a possibility.

363
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,208
It would have to be
perfectly timed

364
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,166
and there's no guarantee.

365
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,333
We may be
more successful

366
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,583
in deciphering
the code they use

367
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,333
to transport through
the magnetic shield.

368
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,667
Can you do that?

369
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,917
DATA:
Eventually, sir.
I am working on it now

370
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:52,750
but the number
of permutations
is almost endless.

371
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,083
Keep trying.

372
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,583
While he's doing
that, Number One

373
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,417
I want you and La Forge
to try and find some way

374
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:58,959
of getting through
one of those holes

375
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,166
because... one way
or another

376
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,542
we have got to
get an away team
on the planet

377
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,208
to locate power source
for the shield

378
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,166
and neutralize it.

379
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,750
You're certain
they'll negotiate?

380
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,625
Oh, they'll
negotiate

381
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,208
or they'll call it that.

382
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,166
They've taken
what they want.

383
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,875
Now they'll rationalize it

384
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,792
by throwing us
some sort of bone.

385
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,417
And when we don't
accept their offer?

386
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:23,959
The minute that they believe
that we won't accept

387
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,542
their compensation
for the children

388
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:26,750
they'll break off
the discussion

389
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,375
they'll disappear
behind their shield

390
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,667
locking us out,
and the children in--

391
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:35,542
forever.

392
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,625
That's why I've got
to keep them talking.

393
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,750
Custodian.

394
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,750
Wesley Crusher's voice
will be entered

395
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,375
into the authorized file
for third-level clearance.

396
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,959
CUSTODIAN:
Proceed, Duana.

397
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:07,750
Announce yourself
to The Custodian.

398
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,166
Hello, Custodian.

399
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,417
I am Wesley Crusher.

400
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,959
Hello, Wesley.

401
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:15,917
Your voice will now activate
third-level clearance.

402
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,583
What does that mean?

403
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,583
You may ask any
questions you wish.

404
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,291
Thank you.

405
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,000
Duana, what does
The Custodian do?

406
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,834
It frees us from all burden.

407
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,709
It takes care of all our needs.

408
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:30,959
It regulates our lives.

409
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,125
Who built it?

410
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,250
The progenitors.

411
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,375
When?

412
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,417
Oh, hundreds of centuries ago.

413
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:39,542
What is its power source?

414
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,750
Wesley, why is
that important?

415
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,333
It does what
we ask it to;
it always has.

416
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,458
What difference
does it make
how it works?

417
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,583
If you don't know
how it works

418
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,917
then how can you
repair it?

419
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,333
Why would we want to repair it?

420
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,834
From time to time,
every computer...

421
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:59,250
I mean, Custodian,
requires maintenance.

422
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,542
Wesley, Radue is right.

423
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:05,041
You ask questions
I can't answer.

424
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:09,542
Ask The Custodian
instead.

425
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,625
Custodian

426
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,458
can you show me
where Harry is?

427
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,125
Yes.

428
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,166
Custodian,
show me Harry.

429
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,583

430
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,250
(<i> instrument buzzing</i> )

431
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,583
I never
did this before.

432
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,625
It's fun.

433

(<i> laughs</i> )

434
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,667
You are going to make him
into a sculptor?

435
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,250
He already is.

436
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,667
He was just never
encouraged properly.

437
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,041
The tool Leda
is giving him

438
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,959
will allow him
to bring out
his visions.

439
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,000
It will take him years
to learn to do that.

440
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,542
Oh, no

441
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,125
it will happen
quite quickly.

442
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,625
Custodian,
show me Alexandra.

445
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,166
Yeah.

(<i> laughs</i> )

447
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,458
Custodian, show me Mason.

448
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,625
Stop, Custodian.

449
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,959
We must work now.

450
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:11,625
There's much to learn.

451
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,709
What's in there?

452
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,583
The power source?

453
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,959
I don't know.

RADUE:
Captain Picard.

463
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,250
Dr. Crusher and I
are ready, Radue.

464
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,000
Are you ill, Captain?

465
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,375
No, Doctor Crusher
is a staff officer.

466
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,041
Starfleet Regulation 6.57
requires that at least

467
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,458
two staff officers are present

468
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,667
during any treaty
or contract negotiations.

469
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,291
Very well.

(<i> communications beep</i> )

471
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,917
Not much on

472
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:10,917
Captain, I am not aware
of Regulation 6.57.

473
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,542
No, Data, neither am I.

474
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,125
I see, sir.

475
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:18,500
Oh, I see, sir.

476
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,542
Dr. Crusher,
please report to the Bridge.

477
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:22,375
Now we'll see
what they have in mind.

478
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:28,000
(<i> electrical whine</i> )

479
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,333
Before we begin

480
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,959
we want to see
the children.

481
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:34,500
No, we're here to negotiate
appropriate compensation

482
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,166
not to pander to emotions.

483
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,959
Please, sit.

484
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,959
We do not condone
your actions.

485
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:46,000
You're attempting to
salve your conscience

486
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
by offering us goods

487
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,208
in exchange for
our children.

488
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,000
Why do you want
them back so badly?

489
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,917
<i>You</i> can always
have more.

490
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:55,291
You're trifling with
the primal instincts
of our species.

491
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,709
I must warn you
that human parents

492
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:59,709
are quite willing to die
for their children.

493
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:02,625
Returning the children
is nonnegotiable.

494
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:06,291
I promise you, they will have
a beautiful life with us

495
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,667
and they'll be father and mother
to a new breed

496
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,041
born of an ancient culture.

497
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:14,709
But how can you be so sure
that<i> they</i> can have children?

498
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:15,834
You can't.

499
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,291
But they<i> will.</i>

500
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,750
Our inability to bear children

501
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,041
is a genetic dysfunction.

502
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,667
It's not
contagious.

503
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:30,500
We sympathize
with your situation.

504
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,000
Surely, there is a solution

505
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,709
that can be
mutually satisfactory.

506
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:36,917
For us, the problem
is solved

507
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:38,750
and we're offering you
information

508
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,208

509
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:43,750
What more can we offer?

00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,500
What more
would you like?

511
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,166
A significant beginning

512
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,125
but first, I must ask
that Dr. Crusher

513
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,959
be allowed to see her son
before we continue.

a positive trait.

Not yet, Wes.

go to your head.

532
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:48,959
I won't.

He says the other

00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,667
I've got it, Captain.

721
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:20,667
The Aldeans
are suffering

722
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,750
from radiation
poisoning.

723
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,792
Is that what made
them sterile?

724
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:24,834
Yes.

725
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:26,041
Is it
reversible?

726
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,208
With proper

Sir.

728
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:32,458
These permutations are going
to take a very long time.

729
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:33,417
How long?

730
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:34,542
Weeks.

731
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:35,875
RIKER:
There is
the other option.

732
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:37,041
LA FORGE:
We were able
to further define

733
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,792
the weakness
in their shield.

734
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:41,875
It's not so much a hole
as it is a fluctuation.

735
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:43,208
If the timing is
precise, it is possible

736
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,875
to beam through
and onto the planet.

737
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,875
Why don't we just beam the
children up through the hole?

738
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:50,041
The timing would be more
difficult and the risk greater.

739
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,417
All right,
you and Data beam down.

740
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:52,583
Locate the power source
of that shield.

Knock it out.

742
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:57,417
I'll, uh, delay the Aldeans
till you're ready.

No, Alexandra.

747
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,458
Why?

748
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,125
We can't eat.

751
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,583
but it's our way
of telling them

752
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,542
that we want to go home.

753
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:37,542
Understand?

754
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:38,875
Yeah.

you may come down now

It's your choice.

761
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,709

769
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:46,959
There's no way
we can override?

770
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:49,583
No, but I can
scramble the input

771
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:51,375
so that nobody
else can.

772
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:55,417
Before we begin, Captain

773
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:57,709
you must speak
with the children.

774
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,458
It seems they're
on some sort of "strike"?

775
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:03,041
I don't-I don't
understand it.

776
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:05,667
You must deal with this,
Captain.

777
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:09,542
I'm, uh, not very good
with children.

778
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,917
Strike.

779
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:18,291
I'll see
what I can do.

I'm sure if we
stick together in this, guys

Hi, Captain.

but I'm
not sure.

It's a different
system than ours.

790
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:38,375
Good, Wesley.

791
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,375
Now...

Captain?

793
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:41,583
Yes, Harry?

794
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:42,667
If something happens

795
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:44,125
and you have
to leave us here

796
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:45,166
will you tell my dad

797
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:46,667
that I'm sorry
I made him angry

798

and... that I miss him?

799
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:52,583
You will tell him that,
Harry

800
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:55,959

how much I admire his son.

They want
to go home.

The radiation
levels on Aldea

811
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,709
have been building up
over a long period of time.

812
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,000
It is similar to what
was experienced

813
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,625
on Earth
in the 21st century

814
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,417
when the ozone layer
deteriorated

815
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,083
and surface
of the planet
was flooded

816
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,792
with ultraviolet
radiation.

817
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:52,000
The shield that protected
your world in one way

818
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,709
is weakening it in another.

819
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:55,333
It is the radiation
of your own sun

820
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:56,750
that is destroying you.

821
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,875
You are trying
to confuse the issue.

00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:01,333
Please listen.

823

You're all suffering
from radiation poisoning.

824
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,291
Sterility is only
the latest symptom.

825
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:09,125
If the children remain,
they will be affected as well.

826
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,750
That's impossible.
Our scientists would have known.

827
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,208
How could they?

828
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,417
Your scientists have forgotten
how everything works.

829
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:18,166
No, all lies.

830
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,375
No, wait.

831
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,625
Don't send them
back yet.

What<i> if</i> they're right?

833
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,208
Instead of
the children
being our hope

834
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:30,208
what if we're
condemning them
to our fate?

835
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,417

protecting their own interests.

836

As are we.

00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:37,250
But hear them out.

838
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,917
The Captain and
Dr. Crusher are saying

839
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:40,750
that the very thing
which has given us

this tragedy.

I assume you have control

We've disabled the system
temporarily.

We found the power source
of the shield

and we've neutralized it.

to maintain its integrity

use the shield.

but the people
will live.

900
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,834
And we know they'll
make good parents.

901
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:54,750
Wesley!

902
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,875
Sorry, Captain.

903
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:57,083
She just wanted
to thank you

904
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:58,917
for bringing her home
to her mother.

905
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,750
Thank you.

906
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:16,458
Come on, Alexandra.

907
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:24,750

908
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,625
Mr. La Forge

909
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,458
out of orbit,
warp five.

910
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:29,583
Yes, sir.

911
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,834
Certainly, sir.

912
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:36,875
