<i>We are running at warp 7</i>

7
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:21,959
<i>What has brought us here</i>

8
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>is a series of strange messages</i>

10
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,083

11
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,333
(<i> party noises</i> )

12
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,000
S.S.<i> Tsiolkovsky,</i>
repeat your message.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,250
FEMALE:
Well, hello,<i> Enterprise.</i>

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,625
Welcome.

15
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,583
I hope you have a lot
of pretty boys onboard

16
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,208
because I'm willing
and waiting

17
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:48,208
if in fact, we're going to have
a real blowout here.

18
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,542
(<i> wild party sounds</i> )

19
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:52,750
MALE:
Do it! Yeah, go ahead.

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,166
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Do it!

(<i> explosion</i> )

22
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:05,875
Captain, what we've just
heard is... impossible.

23
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,458
Report.

24
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,667
I believe
that last sound

25
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:12,291
was an emergency
hatch being blown.

26
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,875
Are you certain?

27
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,792
Yes, of course you are.

28
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,083
Data, Geordi, Tasha.

29
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,667
Sensor scans now reveal

30
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,041
no life signs
aboard, Captain.

31
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,750
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

32
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,208
Cover the ship
as planned.

33
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,375
Move out.

34
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:19,500
Indications of what humans
would call... a wild party.

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,834
Yeah.

36
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,375
(<i> electrical fritzing</i> )

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,333
Their Bridge.

38
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:30,625
If this thing works,
be sure to record everything.

39
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,875
You were right.

40
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,875
Somebody blew out the hatch.

41
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,125
They were all sucked out
into space.

42
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:45,083
Correction, sir--
that's blown out.

43
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,583
Thank you, Data.

44
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,458
A common mistake, sir.

45
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,959
Commander Riker, Lieutenant Yar,
location engineering.

46
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,750
Ten people here, sir,
all frozen.

47
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,250
No vital signs.

48
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,792
Frozen? How?

49
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,750
Looks like someone
has been playing

50
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,667
with the environmental
controls, sir.

51
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:05,291
Just let all the heat
bleed away into space.

52
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,792
(<i> shivers</i> )

53
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:13,333
Sir, Lieutenant La Forge
in the crew quarters.

54
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,166
There's something in here.

55
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,750
(<i> rhythmic banging</i> )

56
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,291
(<i> high-pitched whooshing</i> )

57
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,166
Riker to Captain,
I have a report for you, sir.

58
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,625
Picard here.

59
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,333
They're all dead.

60
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,250
Apparently some of them were
blown out the emergency hatches.

61
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,041
But there were 80 people
on that ship, Number One.

62
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,500
Yes, sir.

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,000
As I said...

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,917
all dead.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,834
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

66
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:36,625
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

67
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,792
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

68
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:42,625
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

69
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:47,333
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

70
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,792
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

71
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,417
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

72
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,500
<i>We are downloading</i>
<i>the research information</i>

73
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,542
<i>gathered on</i>
<i>the collapsing star nearby.</i>

74
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:02,875
<i>I am concerned at being</i>
<i>in such close orbit</i>

75
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,959
<i>but the</i> Tsiolkovsky's<i> </i>
<i>research records</i>

76
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,500
<i>will no doubt predict the time</i>
<i>of the star's final collapse.</i>

77
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,458
I can't find
anything unusual

78
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,250
in any of the tricorder readings
they sent over, Captain.

79
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,166
Give me a theory, Doctor.

80
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,667
Anything.

81
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,208
Madness?

82
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,291
Mass hysteria?

83
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,959
Delusion?

84
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,083
Any, or all, Captain.

85
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:31,291
All right, let's bring
the away team back.

86
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,709
Set the transporter

87
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:34,834
to maximum
decontamination

88
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:36,750
and then full
examination

89
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,208
and observation
when they're here.

90
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,959
If you were
any more perfect, Data

91
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,458
I'd have to write you up

92
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,250
in a Starfleet Medical
textbook.

93
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,250
I'm already listed in several
biomechanical texts, Doctor.

94
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,750
Yes, of course.

95
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,166
You're next, Lieutenant.

96
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,375
(<i> beeping</i> )

97
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,500
Normal all across.

98
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:21,083
Except... why are you
perspiring, Lieutenant?

99
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,917
I suppose because<i> you</i>
have it too hot in here.

100
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:26,375
What else
would it be?

101
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,834
That doesn't sound
like you, Geordi.

102
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:30,250
Well, maybe it's not.

103
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,208
Maybe she threw her voice.

104
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,041
Hey, it was a joke.

105
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,166
Of course, but I
would like to run

106
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,959
one or two more tests
on you, Lieutenant.

107
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,000
(<i> sighing</i> )

108
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,583
Sick Bay to Bridge.

109
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,458
Picard here.
Go ahead, Doctor.

110
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,834
I'm confining
Lieutenant La Forge to Sick Bay

111
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,041
until further notice.

112
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,834
Do we have a problem, Doctor?

113
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:58,625
I don't know yet.

114
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,542
Data, I need help

115
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:04,959
in locating some library
computer information.

116
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,375
Specifics, sir?

117
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,875
All I have is a vague memory
of reading somewhere

118
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,917
about someone taking a shower
in his or her clothing.

119
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:14,917
Ah, the body Geordi discovered.

120
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,583
Well, I believe
it may have happened before.

121
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,959
To someone, somewhere.

122
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,333
This ought to be easy

123
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,417
for someone written up
in biomechanical texts.

124
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,000
About that, sir.

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,709
Did the Doctor
believe I was boasting?

126
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,041
Probably.

127
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,875
This may take some time?

128
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,458
At least several hours.

129
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,208
But what I said was
a statement of fact.

130
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,792
Perhaps she will look it up.

131
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:43,667
You can depend on it.

132
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,333
Geordi!

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,333
Security, Lieutenant La Forge
just left Sick Bay

134
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,583
while I was in my office.

135
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,792
He doesn't have
his communicator.

136
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:57,625
It is very important
that we find him.

137
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,792
Security team alert.

138
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:00,291
Pick up Lieutenant
La Forge.

139
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,625
He just left Sick
Bay moments ago.

140
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,333
Captain,
anything further?

141
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,667
Affirmative.

142
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:08,709
Make it a shipwide
search, Lieutenant.

143
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,041
It's a model of the same kind
of tractor beam our ship uses--

144
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,083
with a few ideas
of my own added.

145
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,083
So that's your
science project, huh?

146
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,125
Wes, you're
really something.

147
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,792
And since the Captain
won't let me on the Bridge,

148
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:46,166
I use this to imagine
I'm there.

149
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,792
PICARD:
Take the helm, Mr. Crusher.

150
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:53,917
Set a course for 37 mark 180,
warp 6.

151
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:55,792
That's the Captain's voice.

152
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:58,458
It's pieced together from words
he's used on the intercom.

153
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,000
With this,
I can pretend

154
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,667
he's ordering me to take
the<i> Enterprise</i> anywhere

155
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,333
and listen to this.

156
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,417
Chief Engineer,
report to the Bridge.

157
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,792
Commander Riker, report to the
Bridge.

158
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,792
Dr. Crusher,
report to the Bridge.

159
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,333
What do you think?

160
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,458
I think the Captain's
lucky you're on his side.

161
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,542
But he still won't let me
on the Bridge

162
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:21,125
and there's nothing there
I don't understand.

163
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:25,125
I wish I understood
myself that well.

164
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,959
Are you okay?

165
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,125
No, suddenly I seem to
be burning up inside.

166
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,208
(<i> sighing</i> )

167
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,834
It's so hot in here!

168
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:47,792
Geordi.

169
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,709
Geordi!

170
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,875
Lieutenant Yar in
the observation lounge.

171
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,750
Send a team here now.

172
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,417
Medical's been
worried about you.

173
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:03,542
Help me.

174
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,792
Help me to
not give in

175
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,291
to the wild things
coming into my mind.

176
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,583
Geordi, my job is security.

177
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,041
Tasha, please.

178
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,375
All right.

179
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,959
All right.
Helping is more important.

180
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,542
Geordi, how can I help you?

181
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:24,792
Help me to see
like you do.

182
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:27,667
But you already see
better than I can.

183
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,375
I see more.

184
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,583
But more isn't better.

185
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,583
Geordi, please
put these back...

186
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,750
I want to see
in shallow, dim,

187
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,041
beautiful, human ways.

188
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,667
We'll talk about it, Geordi.

189
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,000
Right now I'm going
to take you to Sick Bay.

190
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,667
All right?

191
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,500
Yeah.

192
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,333
Okay.

193
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,250
Good.

194
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,583
And then we got him down
to Sick Bay

195
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,875
so Dr. Crusher
could examine him.

196
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,000
He wasn't violent?

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,291
No, sir.

198
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,667
He was very upset.

199
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:29,458
He kept talking about
wanting normal vision.

200
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,417
Hmm.
Thank you, Lieutenant.

201
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,792
(<i> sighing</i> )

202
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:49,000
According to our
medical readouts

203
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,500
there's still nothing wrong
with him.

204
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,417
He looks like he's
running a temperature

205
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,208
but every instrument we have
says he's not.

206
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,166
Doctor, every person
on that ship over there died.

207
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,375
Is there any chance

208
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:02,500
that whatever did it
is loose on my ship?

209
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,000
If you mean a disease, sir,
I'd say there's no chance of it.

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
We used full
decontamination.

211
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,375
We examined every team member
very carefully.

212
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:13,458
The entire crew somehow managed
to kill themselves, Doctor.

213
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,667
If it's not a disease,
what else made them do it?

214
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:19,083
The obvious alternatives
are in the areas of insanity

215
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,166
and severe emotional upset.

216
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,000
Troi, do you feel anything

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,834
unusual in
the Lieutenant?

218
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:28,750
Security just told me
that he was longing
for normal sight.

219
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,875
That's a sudden
yearning for that.

220
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,417
Since his records show
no previous mention of that,

221
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,000
the fact that it happened
now could be important.

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,625
But all I sense from him
is confusion.

223
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,875
If I didn't know better,
I'd say he was intoxicated.

224
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,917
Our tests would have
shown that--

225
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:48,000
also any other signs of drugs,
hallucinogens,

226
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,417
or any other contaminants.

227
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,750
(<i> sighing</i> )

228
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,166
Can you provide
more information, sir?

229
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,083
Seeking an instance

230
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,542
of someone showering
in his or her clothing is...

231
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,959
I know. It's like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

232
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:18,250
Why should anyone
wish to expend his
time in such a search?

233
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,208
Correction, Data.
I should have said

234
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,333
<i>proverbial</i> needle
in a haystack.

235
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,625
A human proverb--

236
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,792
as in folklore
or an historical allusion

237
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,000
or tribal memories.

238
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,166
Historical. That's it.

239
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,792
I remember I was reading
a history

240
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:32,041
of all the past starships
named<i> Enterprise.</i>

241
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,208
<i>Enterprise</i> history.

242
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,208
Aberrant behavior.

243
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,792
Medical cross-reference.

244
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:38,875
Captain, I believe
we have the answer

245
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,959
to what happened
over there.

246
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,166
The Constitution-class
Starship<i> Enterprise</i>

247
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,625
Captain James T. Kirk,
commanding.

248
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,083
Similar conditions.

249
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,041
They were monitoring
a planet that was breaking up

250
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,375
and not a collapsing star,
as in this case.

251
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,959
But there were the same
huge shifts in gravity.

252
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,291
Which somehow resulted

253
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,709
in complex strings
of water molecules

254
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:05,166
which acquired carbon
from the body

255
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:09,834
and acted...
acted on the brain like alcohol.

256
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:14,041
Data, download
this information to
Medical immediately.

257
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,291
Aye, sir.
Downloading.

258
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,959
Fascinating.

259
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:21,583
The entire crew
going out of control.

260
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,291
Like intoxication,
but worse.

261
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,625
Judgment almost
completely impaired.

262
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:31,000
Until they found this formula,
barely in time.

263
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,583
Picard to Dr. Crusher.
Come in.

264
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,041
This is Crusher.
Go ahead, Captain.

265
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,542
You can relax, Doctor.

266
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,000
The answer to all of this

267
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,250
is feeding into
your medical banks right now--

268
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,667
including a cure.

269
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,417
Are you certain, Captain?

270
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:47,458
Absolutely.

271
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:56,917
(<i> laughter</i> )

272
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:58,083
Tasha?

273
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,083
What are
you doing?

274
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,750
I need your advice.

275
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,000
That's why I came
to your quarters.

276
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,041
Of course. Anything...

277
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,667
On clothes.

278
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:12,083
You always wear
such beautiful clothes off duty.

279
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:16,583
And your hair always
looks so nice.

280
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,458
I want to change my image.

281
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,041
What do you think
about this?

282
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,000
Or this one?

283
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:27,583
It's not for you.

284
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,709
Tasha...

285
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,959
I feel you're very uncertain.

286
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,709
That you're fighting something.

287
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,041
(<i> high-pitched whooshing</i> )

288
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,834
What is it?

289
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,792
Never mind.

290
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,250
I'll find what
I need myself.

291
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,542
Ship's stores
will have it.

292
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,583
Tasha.

293
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,750
Tasha, wait!

294
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,000
Troi to Captain Picard.

295
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,458
Picard here.

296
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:02,000
Sir, I think
Tasha's been infected, too.

297
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,417
She just left my quarters.

298
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,834
Counselor, it's not
actually an infection.

299
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,917
Yes, sir, it's more
like an intoxication

300
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:13,667
but whatever it is,
she's got it.

301
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,667
Thank you, Counselor.

302
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,041
Number One

303
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,750
it seems our
security chief

304
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,959
has the equivalent
of a snootful.

305
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,625
Inquiry, sir.

306
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,500
Snootful?

307
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,000
Forget it.

308
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,417
Hey, Mom, look
what I can do.

309
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,667
I've been able to widen
and strengthen the beam--

310
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,834
just like I told
you last night.

311
00:18:57,834 --> 00:18:59,208
Do me a favor, Wes.

312
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,834
There's something
happening on this ship.

313
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:03,625
Just to be safe,
I'd like you to stay

314
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,417
in our quarters
until it's solved.

315
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:06,500
Sure, Mom, sure.

316
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,542
Your wish is my command.

317
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:10,208
<i>Now,</i> Wes.

318
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,500
Okay, but you could be
stunting my emotional growth.

319
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,291
You realize that?

320
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,166
Why's it so hot in here,
anyway?

321
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,333
Picard to Crusher.

322
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,333
Crusher here.

323
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,166
Have you made
a test injection yet?

324
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,166
We're getting indications that
this condition is spreading.

325
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,917
No test yet, Captain,
but very soon.

326
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,709
(<i> high-pitched whooshing</i> )

327
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:57,583
Captain, another 41 minutes

328
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,083
will see the information
from the<i> Tsiolkovsky</i>

329
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,250
downloaded to us.

330
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,709
Why so slow?

331
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,583
Slow, sir?

332
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:09,667
The<i> Tsiolkovsky</i> has been
eight months in accumulating it.

333
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:13,083
How much danger from that star--
worst case?

334
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,208
Like a full collapse, sir?

335
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,375
Any stellar material
it threw this way

336
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,917
we could still outrun
on half impulse power.

337
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,208
Picard to Engineering.

338
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,000
Chief Engineer,
report to the Bridge.

339
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,625
Assistant Chief Engineer
Shimoda, report to Medical.

340
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,083
Hi, Jim.

341
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,792
Was that the Captain
ordering you to Medical?

342
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:57,000
Which would leave
no one here on duty.

343
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,083
The Chief was just
summoned to the Bridge.

344
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,458
What about me?

345
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,542
I could call the
Chief on the Bridge

346
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:04,834
if anything happened.

347
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,917
Reporting as ordered, sir.

348
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:20,875
What?

349
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,750
You ordered me to report
to the Bridge, sir.

350
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,959
I did no such thing.

351
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,458
I want you down
in the engine room

352
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,834
just in case we need
to move out of here.

353
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:31,583
PICARD:
Attention, all decks

354
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,917
all divisions.

355
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,333
Effective immediately

356
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,583
I have handed over
control of this vessel

357
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,834
to acting Captain
Wesley Crusher.

358
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,208
Acting Captain?!

359
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,542
WESLEY:
Thank you, Captain Picard,
thank you.

360
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:46,917
And with that order
dawns a brave new day

361
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:48,208
for the<i> Enterprise.</i>

362
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,750
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41209.3:</i>

363
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,208
<i>The strange contaminant</i>
<i>that led to the deaths</i>

364
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,709
<i>of the</i> Tsiolkovsky<i> crew is now</i>
<i>aboard the</i> Enterprise

365
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,417
<i>and our engineering section</i>

366
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,709
<i>has been commandeered</i>
<i>by young Wesley Crusher.</i>

367
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:12,542
And henceforth

368
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:18,166
a dessert course shall
precede and follow every meal

369
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,125
including breakfast.

370
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,917
Hooray for the
acting captain!

371
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:26,625
Never got as far
as Sick Bay, Wes.

372
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,500
I feel too good for that.

373
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,834
(<i> laughter</i> )

374
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,625
Incredible!

375
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,333
How did you do that?

376
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,250
Hooked my model tractor beam
into ship's power.

377
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,375
Now it's a repulser beam, too.

378
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,083
Want in?

379
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:50,041
Swear to be faithful to you,
Captain.

380
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,792
Number One, MacDougal, get
that boy out of Engineering.

381
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,083
Sir.

382
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:13,667
I'm getting very strange
reports from all decks.

383
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:15,583
Such as?

384
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,959
Such as the ship's training
division ordering all officers

385
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,709
to attend a lecture
on metaphysics.

386
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,041
Metaphysics?

387
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,375
Confirmed, sir.

388
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:25,208
And there was
a rather peculiar limerick

389
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:28,959
being delivered by someone
in the shuttlecraft bay.

390
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:32,542
I am not sure
I understand it.

391
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:35,750
"There was a young lady
from Venus

392
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,917
whose body was
shaped like a..."

393
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,083
Captain to Security, come in!

394
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,917
Did I say something wrong?

395
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:45,083
I don't understand
their humor either.

396
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,709
Yeah, Captain.

397
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,709
Where is my security chief?!
Get me Lieutenant Yar!

398
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:51,000
Keep your britches on.

399
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,667
YAR:
Captain Picard.

400
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:53,709
Lieutenant, where are you?

401
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:55,667
I'm in my quarters

402
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,709
and, um... I'm pretty busy
right at the moment,

403
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:03,166
Jean-Luc.

404
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:07,166
All right, Lieutenant,
you just stay right there.

405
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,500
Data.

406
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,834
Go to
Lieutenant Yar.

407
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:10,959
Take her down to Sick Bay.

408
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,625
Aye, sir.

409
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,417
Captain to Security, I want
all your senior supervisors

410
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:17,917
to report to
the Bridge immediately.

411
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:28,959
(<i> giggling</i> )

412
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:31,041
Lieutenant Yar?

413
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,834
Here, Data.

414
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,333
You wanted me?

415
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,792
Captain Picard ordered me

416
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:49,041
to escort you to Sick Bay,
Lieutenant.

417
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:53,125
Did he say when?

418
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,959
I'm sure he meant now.

419
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:59,166
So you should get
into uniform.

420
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,959
But I got out of my uniform
for you, Data.

421
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:07,125
Do you know how old I was
when I was abandoned?

422
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,542
Chronological age?

423
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:12,583
No, I'm afraid
I am not familiar with...

424
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:17,375
Five. Five years old.

425
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:20,458
But I survived.

426
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:25,834
I learned how to stay alive,
how to avoid the rape gangs.

427
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:28,875
I was 15 before I escaped.

428
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,792
I am sorry.

429
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:33,333
I did not know.

430
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:37,166
And what I want now
is gentleness

431
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,750
and joy

432
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,834
and love...

433
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,125
from you, Data.

434
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,625
You are fully functional,
aren't you?

435
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:46,792
Of course, but...

436
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:47,875
How fully?

437
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,125
In every way, of course.

438
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:52,959
I am programmed in
multiple techniques--

439
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:56,250
a broad variety
of pleasuring...

440
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,125
Oh! You jewel!

441
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,625
That's exactly what I hoped.

442
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:14,250
What have you learned,
Number One?

443
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,375
Captain, the ship's engines are
cut off from the Bridge.

444
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,083
The Assistant Chief Engineer

445
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,875
has pulled out the isolinear
optical chips from command.

446
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,834
All the engines are off-line.

447
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:26,250
Wesley has hooked up
some kind of tractor beam

448
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,458
to the ship's power.

449
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,208
He has it aimed at the door.

450
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:32,417
And we can't get past
to get to the computer.

451
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,500
Can you short out the power?

452
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,542
Yes, I can, but it's
going to take some time.

453
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:40,500
Do it!

454
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,000
Bill.

455
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:53,041
Deanna, what?

456
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:56,375
So many minds on this ship...

457
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,583
all free...

458
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,041
released.

459
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,458
Deanna.

460
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:05,792
I can feel them all...

461
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,333
what they want...

462
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,834
what they feel.

463
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:13,875
It's a side of humans
I never felt before.

464
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:17,041
(<i> high-pitched whooshing</i> )

465
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,417
Come on.

466
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:21,166
I'm getting you
to Sick Bay.

467
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:23,291
Wouldn't you rather
be alone with me?

468
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:26,417
With me in your mind?

469
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,583
The medical records we found
say this works almost instantly.

470
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:52,041
It's not fair, Doc.

471
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:55,333
I've never seen
a rainbow...

472
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,333
a sunset...

473
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,625
sunrise.

474
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,291
This is going
to help me?

475
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:05,542
Help me see
like you?

476
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,625
Dr. Crusher.

477
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,792
(<i> high-pitched whooshing</i> )

478
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:23,166
Deanna needs your help.

479
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,083
The formula
from the old<i> Enterprise</i>

480
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,125
didn't work.

481
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,333
What?

482
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,875
This water-carbon
complex may induce

483
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,000
the same symptoms but
somehow it's different.

484
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,792
Maybe it's mutated.

485
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:35,041
But I've got to isolate it
in order to analyze it.

486
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,583
We don't have
that kind of time.

487
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:38,166
You brought Deanna in.

488
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,750
Yes, she's infected.
Then you touched her.

489
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,291
Oh, God, and you touched me.

490
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:45,000
Wait, I've got
to quarantine you.

491
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,166
If I don't get the command
computer back on-line soon

492
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:50,750
none of this-- whatever
this is-- will matter.

493
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,000
We'll all be dead.

494
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,208
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

495
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:07,208
<i>It is no longer an inconvenient</i>
<i>childish prank.</i>

496
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,041
<i>Young Wesley Crusher--</i>

<i>admittedly a victim of</i>

498
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,917
<i>is now in control</i>
<i>of my starship.</i>

499
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:20,000
Wesley, this is Captain Picard.
Do you see me?

500
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,250
Yes, sir.

501
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,542
You will now
return control

502
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:24,917
of this vessel

503
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:27,291
to the Bridge where
it belongs, at once.

504
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:29,542
I'm sorry, sir.
Why don't you just tell me

505
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:31,458
what you want done
and I'll do it.

506
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:34,834
Because ship captains control
their own vessels, young man!

507
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:37,333
But, sir, you don't
do it yourself.

508
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:41,000
You give the orders,
but somebody else does it.

509
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,208
What's wrong with
giving me the orders to do it?

510
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,917
Captain, getting
unusual readings now

511
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,709
from the
dwarf star.

512
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:48,667
Stand by on that for a moment.

513
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:52,083
Wesley!

514
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:57,083
Wes, are you aware
that you are behaving strangely?

515
00:29:57,083 --> 00:30:01,959
That a kind of infection
was brought over

516
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:04,000
from the<i> Tsiolkovsky</i>

517
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,959
which acts
like intoxication?

518
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:10,417
Are you saying
that's why I feel so hot

519
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,208
and so strange?

520
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:17,583
That's... that's a very adult
bit of reasoning, Wesley.

521
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,417
So, you mean I'm drunk!

522
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,375
I feel strange but also good.

523
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,041
Because...

524
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:28,750
because you have lost
the capacity for self-judgment.

525
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,458
Now, alcohol does this, Wesley

526
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:34,417
but the contaminant we brought
back from the<i> Tsiolkovsky</i>

527
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,875
does it even more so.

528
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,375
What would you do
if you got your ship back?

529
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:43,166
Oh... it's very important
I do, Wesley

530
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:44,959
because I must immediately lock

531
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:47,166
a tractor beam
onto the<i> Tsiolkovsky--</i>

532
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,500
and tow it out of...

533
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,792
Tractor beams
are my specialty, skipper!

534
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:51,083
I'll contact you
when that's done.

535
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,375
Wesley out!

536
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:56,250
Wesley! Wesley!

537
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:00,917
Conn?

538
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:02,250
Where are you headed?

539
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,250
Sir! The star.

540
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,041
It's beginning to collapse.

541
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:16,291
What the hell is happening
in Engineering?

542
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,166
Lock on.

543
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:23,083
Lock on,<i> Tsiolkovsky.</i>

544
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,834
Come on, now.

545
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,083
Where's that
sonic driver?

546
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,834
It's over there.

547
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:39,542
Okay. Let's see if this
cuts out his tractor beam power.

548
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,667
Come on.

549
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:50,583
No, no.

550
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:54,166
I must find the answer.

551
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:57,125
I've got to find the answer.

552
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:06,041
Captain, tractor beam.

553
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,834
We just locked on
to the<i> Tsiolkovsky.</i>

554
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:10,041
Captain to...

555
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,083
Wesley!

556
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,083
Wesley Crusher, come in.

557
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,625
Ah, good. Data.

558
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,709
At least you're functioning.

559
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:23,542
Fully, Captain.

560
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:29,041
Data, intoxication is
a human condition.

561
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:31,208
Your brain is different.

562
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,792
It's not the same as...

563
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,750
We are more alike than
unlike, my dear Captain.

564
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,542
I have pores.
Humans have pores.

565
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:47,250
I have...
fingerprints.

566
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,834
Humans have fingerprints.

567
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:53,959
My chemical nutrients
are like your blood.

568
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,834
If you prick me...

569
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,417
do I not... leak?

570
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:04,750
Doctor...

571
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,834
Captain, can I see you
in your ready room?

572
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:08,208
It's a private matter.

573
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,917
No, actually,
it's an urgent one.

574
00:33:09,917 --> 00:33:11,041
But...

575
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,417
Damn it.

576
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,792
Now, Doctor.

577
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,792
I believe I've become infected
myself, Captain.

578
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:27,792
Do you know what
the infection is?

579
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:29,083
(<i> giggles</i> )

580
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,333
Come on. Quickly!

581
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,750
Sorry.

582
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,625
It is definitely like
alcohol intoxication--

583
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:37,041
the same lack of good judgment.

584
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:42,375
For example, right now,
I find you extremely...

585
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,959
extremely...

586
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:48,125
Of course, we haven't time
for that sort of thing.

587
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,917
What sort of thing?

588
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:53,250
Oh, God, would I love
to show you.

589
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,291
Doctor, there
must be a cure.

590
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:58,000
Some formula...

591
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,291
(<i> clears throat</i> )

592
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:01,291
...similar to
the old one.

593
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,250
Damn it, damn it,
Captain.

594
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:07,875
My dear Captain.

595
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:12,291
You owe me something.

596
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,917
You do realize
that, don't you?

597
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:16,500
I'm a woman.

598
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,875
I haven't had the comfort
of a husband, a man...

599
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:26,917
Not now, Doctor.

600
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:28,166
Please.

601
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,750
Bridge to Riker, urgent.

602
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,750
Riker here.

603
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,375
Sir, regret to inform you

604
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,709
that the Captain
appears to be infected.

605
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:50,000
And Data.

606
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,709
Thank you, Lieutenant.

607
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:52,875
I'm on my way.

608
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,667
You'll have
to handle this.

609
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:56,792
Are you saying
you're going to handle that?

610
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:06,208
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

611
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,250
WORF:
What we're
seeing, sir

612
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,709
is a huge chunk of the star's
surface blown away--

613
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:16,000
heading for us.

614
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:19,125
Take us...

615
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,917
Are you all right, sir?

616
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:23,417
Worf...

617
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,583
you do know
what to do.

618
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,709
Take us...

619
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,208
Take us out of here.

620
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:30,542
Right.

621
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:43,792
The controls
are still off-line, sir.

622
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,208
Override.

623
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,709
Same result, sir.

624
00:35:57,166 --> 00:36:00,917
RIKER:
Wes, come in, please.

625
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:03,750
Wesley Crusher, this is Riker.

626
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,917
This is urgent. Come in, please.

627
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:17,500
Engineering, urgent.

628
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,500
We must have ship's power.

629
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,834
These are control chips.

630
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:31,291
Bridge from Engineering.

631
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,166
The star is
still collapsing.

632
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,875
We're directly in the path.

633
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,458
I can't help you, Bridge.

634
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,625
Someone here has yanked out
all the control chips.

635
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,542
It was an adult who did it.

636
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:43,709
Sir, I estimate 14 minutes
until that mass gets here.

637
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:46,208
No way, sir. I cannot replace
these chips in 14 minutes.

638
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,417
Two hours...

639
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:49,166
three, maybe.

640
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,417
Data could assemble
them back faster.

641
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:54,083
PICARD:
What?

642
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,375
What's that?

643
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:56,959
What's that, Wesley?

644
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:58,709
Well, they're just simple
isolinear chips, sir.

645
00:36:58,709 --> 00:36:59,917
To Data, anyway.

646
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,291
He could shuffle them
like cards.

647
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,000
Come on, Data. Hurry!

648
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:13,000
<i>Ship's Log,</i>
<i>First Officer Riker:</i>

649
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,583

00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:16,250

653
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,834
<i>in the time we have left,</i>
<i>to regain his senses</i>

654
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:25,500

655
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,875
Nice to see
you, Wesley.

656
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,709
Hi, Mr. Data.

657
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:30,041
No time for courtesy.

658
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,875
Get the damned
control chips back in place

659
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,083
in the correct order. Now!

660
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:37,417
It's like a game of
"How fast can you do it?"

661
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:39,375
Ah, a game.

662
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:42,417
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

663
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:52,041
I think I can switch this
to main viewer, sir.

664
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,208
Data, we have eight or
nine minutes at most.

665
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:09,875
Can you finish by then?

666
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:14,917
No. This will take slightly
more time than we have, sir.

667
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:29,583
Oh, damn it, no! I can't
afford to get this.

668
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:40,125
Beverly.

669
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:42,542
Yes, Jean-Luc?

670
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:46,583
You will address
me as Captain.

671
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,000
(<i> laughs</i> ):
Captain?

672
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,709
Well, then, my dear Captain

673
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:57,875
you will address me as
Chief Medical Officer or Doctor.

674
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,583
I will?

675
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:00,792
That's true.

676
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:03,959
I started out by
calling you Beverly

677
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:06,959
and, of course,
naturally, you...

678
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:10,375
I'm still not
thinking straight.

679
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:15,125
Likewise. Where the hell
was I headed?

680
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:18,792
If that's something you
were going to test...

681
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:20,583
Yes, on Geordi!

682
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:21,959
Come here.

683
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,875
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

684
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:37,834
See how I reversed the fields
on this, Commander?

685
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:41,834
I made it into
a repulser beam.

686
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:44,834
If we just had
one minute more, sir.

687
00:39:57,417 --> 00:40:01,542
If this were a hundred times
more powerful than it is...

688
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,125
Why not try it
with the real thing?

689
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,709
Why not reverse fields on this,
Ma'am?

690
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,208
If we just need an extra minute.

691
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:16,208
It would take weeks
of laying out new circuits.

692
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:18,125
Why not just see it
in your head?

693
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,291
Come off the main lead

694
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:25,709
split off at the force activator

695
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:28,875
then... then...

696
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:33,291
if I could just
think straight about this.

697
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:36,000
I made this a broader-based
remedy--

698
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,041
I hope.

699
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:40,959
But it's still very close
to the formula

700
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,625
from the old<i> Enterprise</i>
records.

701
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:45,625
Decades ago,
light-years away...

702
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:48,667
BEVERLY:
But almost exactly the
same conditions as here.

703
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:51,917
Wow! What was
in that, Doctor?

704
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,709
My head's beginning
to clear.

705
00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:56,125
Come here.

706
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,583
Here, take this
to Engineering.

707
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,834
I'll make up hypos
for the others.

708
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:07,000
Okay...

709
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,375
Bev.

710
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,792
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

711
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:24,834
We're not going
to make it, Captain.

712
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:27,375
If we only had
a minute or so more.

713
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:38,375
Yes, then reversing power leads

714
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:41,041
back through the force activator

715
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:46,125
repulser beam hard
against<i> Tsiolkovsky.</i>

00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,583
WESLEY:
Don't you see?

717
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:56,000
It's giving us a push-off,
the extra time we need.

718
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,834
We're pushing away.

719
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:21,709
Bridge, engage engines.

720
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,333
Captain, something seemed
to move us aside

721
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,834
at the last minute.

722
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:39,792
Do we owe our thanks
to Commander Data, sir?

723
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:43,875
PICARD:
Yes, and Wesley may have given
us a few seconds, too.

724
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,792
Did he say Wesley--
the boy?

725
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:48,875
He said Wesley.

726
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:59,083
It's only fair to mention
Wesley in a log entry, sir.

727
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,792
Fair is fair.

728
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:06,166
And let's credit
his science teacher, too.

729
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:27,917
Congratulations, sir.

730
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:29,834
To many people.

731
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:46,500
Data.

732
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,125
I'm only going to tell
you this just once--

733
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:51,250
it never happened.

734
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,834
I put it to you all--

735
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:02,417
I think we shall end up
with a fine crew

736
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:05,083
if we avoid temptation.

737
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,208
So, Number One

738
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:14,041
let's go to
our next job.

739
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,166
Aye, sir.

740
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:18,000
Helm, prepare
for warp 3.

741
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,166
Heading 294, mark 37.

742
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:25,583
Warp 3, heading 294,
mark 37, sir.

743
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:27,333
Engage.
