00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:05,250
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45047.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,291 --> 00:00:07,667
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is en route</i>

3
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:09,792
<i>to the uninhabited</i>
<i>El-Adrel system.</i>

4
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:12,041
<i>Its location</i>
<i>is near the territory</i>

5
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:15,417
<i>occupied by an enigmatic race</i>
<i>known as the Children of Tama.</i>

6
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,500
Apparently, the Tamarians
arrived at El-Adrel IV

7
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:19,959
nearly three weeks ago.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,375
They have been transmitting
a subspace signal

9
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:24,375
towards Federation space
ever since.

10
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:27,959
The signal is a standard
mathematical progression.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,208
It does not carry
a specific message.

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,458
But they wanted us to know
they were there.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,792
Apparently so, Number One.

14
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:34,667
Starfleet believes
their presence

15
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:36,375
is an attempt
at communication.

16
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:38,166
Commander.

17
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,959
Federation vessels
have encountered Tamarian ships

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,166
seven times
over the past 100 years.

19
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,417
Each meeting went
without incident.

20
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,875
However, formal relations
were not established

21
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:47,959
because communication
was not possible.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,583
Why?

23
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,333
The Children of Tama were
called "incomprehensible"

24
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,750
by Captain Silvestri
of the<i> Shiku Maru.</i>

25
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,291
Other accounts
were comparable.

26
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,875
WORF:
A cause for concern.

27
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:00,041
For all we know they could be
threatening our border.

28
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,500
Everything in
the previous accounts

29
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,208
suggest a peaceable race.

30
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,542
We have to start from there.

31
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,166
Agreed. I appreciate
your prudence, Mr. Worf.

32
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,875
Starfleet believes
that the Tamarians

33
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:12,458
have extended a hand.

34
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,875
We must do the same.

35
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,250
Children of Tama.

36
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,917
I've heard rumors
about them for years.

37
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,792
Indeed, but are they truly
incomprehensible.

38
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,250
In my experience

39
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,625
communication is a matter
of patience, imagination.

40
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:30,083
I would like to believe
that these are qualities

41
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,792
that we have
in sufficient measure.

42
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:41,750
Rai and Jiri at Lungha.

43
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,709
Rai of Lowani.

44
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,500
Lowani under two moons.

45
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:49,709
Jiri of Ubaya.

46
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,583
Ubaya of crossed roads
at Lungha.

47
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,709
Lungha.
Her sky gray.

48
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:08,500
Rai and Jiri at Lungha.

49
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:11,792
Counselor?

50
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:13,709
I sense nothing
but good intentions

51
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,041
from them, captain.

52
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,542
Mr. Data?
The Tamarian seems

53
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:22,208
to be stating the proper names
of individuals and locations.

54
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,625
Yes, but what does it all mean?

55
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,834
DATA:
I'm at a loss, sir.

56
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:30,917
Captain.

57
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,917
Would you be prepared
to consider the creation

58
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,959
of a mutual
non-aggression pact

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,542
between our two peoples,
possibly leading

60
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,667
to a trade agreement
and cultural interchange.

61
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,333
Does this sound like
a reasonable course
of action to you?

62
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:53,250
(<i> laughing</i> )

63
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,458
Kadir beneath Mo Moteh.

64
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,166
The River Temarc.

65
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,000
In winter.

66
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,625
Impressions, Number One.

67
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,500
It appears
they're trying their best.

68
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,709
As are we,
for what it's worth.

69
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,875
Shaka.

70
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:15,625
When the walls fell...

71
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,083
Darmok.

72
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,208
Darmok?

73
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,500
Rai and Jiri
at Lungha.

74
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:25,959
Shaka.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,500
When the walls fell...

76
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,333
Zima at Anzo.

77
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,333
Zima and Bakor.

78
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,750
Darmok at Tanagra.

79
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,291
Mirab.
His sails unfurled.

80
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,500
Darmok.

81
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:37,625
Mirab.

82
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:38,792
Temarc.

83
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,125
The river Temarc.

84
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:03,375
Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.

85
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,542
Block their transporter
with the shields.

86
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,583
Extend to maximum range.

87
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,583
Not enough time.

88
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,000
Where is he?

89
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,166
The Tamarians have transported
Captain Picard

90
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,542
to the planet's surface
along with their own captain.

91
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,875
Riker to O'Brien.

92
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:22,875
It will not be possible
to transport, sir.

93
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:24,166
The Tamarian ship

94
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,458
has created a particle
scattering field

95
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,875
on the planet's ionosphere.

96
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:31,458
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

97
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,583
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

98
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,250
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

99
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:41,333
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

100
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:45,542
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

101
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:49,625
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

102
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:52,208
Riker to Captain Picard.

103
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,625
Do you read me, Captain?

104
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,208
Can we compensate?

105
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,875
No, sir.

106
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,250
The Tamarians are projecting
a particle sustaining beam

107
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,083
into the upper atmosphere.

108
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,000
The result is
a hyper-ionization

109
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,917
that virtually disrupts
all EM and subspace carriers.

110
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,667
Then they can't communicate
with their man, either.

111
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,417
They won't be able to beam
anyone through the field.

112
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,917
That is correct.

113
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,667
However, they have left
sensor frequencies clear.

114
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,709
Then they'll be able
to tell what's going on.

115
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,208
Analysis, Mr. Worf.

116
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,458
What the hell is going on?

117
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,750
A contest, perhaps,
between champions.

118
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,750
Our captain against theirs.

119
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,583
Theirs was armed.

120
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,500
Darmok and Jalad.

121
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,625
You want to fight
with me?

122
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,959
Is that it?

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,417
A challenge?

124
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,959
Darmok and Jalad.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,542
I don't know who or what
Darmok or Jalad are

126
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,125
but I certainly didn't come here
to start a war.

127
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:58,750
Darmok and Jalad
at Tanagra.

128
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,125
Sorry, Captain.

129
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,458
(<i> sighs</i> )

130
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,250
Shaka.

131
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,375
When the walls fell.

132
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,542
Sensors show
that Captain Picard

133
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,792
and the Tamarian
are in apparent good health

134
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,917
approximately 20 meters
from each other.

135
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,417
Hail the Tamarian ship.

136
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,583
On screen.

137
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,750
You're holding our captain.

138
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,291
I want him released.

139
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,208
Darmok at Tanagra.

140
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,375
Your action could be interpreted
as an act of war.

141
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:01,834
Kiteo.
His eyes closed.

142
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,250
Chenza at court.

143
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,750
The court of silence.

144
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:08,917
Chenza!

145
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,458
Is there anyway to
get through to them?

146
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,375
Not without further study.

147
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,291
Close the channel,
Mr. Worf.

148
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,041
Gladly, sir.

149
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,500
Worf, I want you to assemble
a security team

150
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,375
take a shuttle
down to the planet.

151
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:22,792
Bring back the captain.

152
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:24,500
Aye, commander.

153
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:27,500
Sir, the Tamarians are fully
capable of stopping a shuttle.

154
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:28,709
I'm aware of that.

155
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,792
But disrupting
our transporter beam

156
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,875
and firing on a shuttle
are two entirely
different things.

157
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:37,041
I'm betting they're not
going to push it that far.

158
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,500
Shaka.

159
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:08,333
When the walls fell.

160
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,959
PICARD:
Shaka, indeed.

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,709
What now, Captain?

162
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,417
Will you attack me
in my sleep?

163
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,208
If I don't
freeze to death first.

164
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,667
Darmok of Kanza.

165
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,375
Jalad at the Kiteo.

166
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,875
Picard of the Federation.

167
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,917
Of the starship
<i>Enterprise...</i>

168
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,083
of the planet Earth.

169
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,542
Kadir beneath Mo Moteh.

170
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,083
Temba.

171
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,667
Temba?

172
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:03,000
What does that mean?

173
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,458
Fire?

174
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,750
Does Temba mean fire?

175
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:09,750
Temba.
His arms wide.

176
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:12,417
Temba is a person?

177
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,917
His arms wide.

178
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:19,959
Because he's...
he's holding them apart in....

179
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,458
in... generosity?

180
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,125
In giving?

181
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,208
In taking?

182
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,458
Temba.
His arms wide.

183
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,291
Thank you.

184
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,542
Thank you.

185
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,458
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

186
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,625
<i>I am sending a shuttlecraft</i>
<i>to find Captain Picard</i>

187
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,625
<i>gambling that the Tamarians</i>
<i>will sit tight</i>

188
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:18,166
<i>rather than risk an exchange</i>
<i>of phaser fire.</i>

189
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,458
The positron density
is .013.

190
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,959
WORF:
Electron concentration 7.95.

191
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,917
Particle gradient 4/7.

192
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,417
We are 250 kilometers
from the planet's surface.

193
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,542
Commander,
the shuttle has reached

194
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,875
the E region
of the planet's ionosphere.

195
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,083
How long can we maintain
communication?

196
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,125
The scattering layer
induced by the Tamarians

197
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,709
is concentrated
in the upper D region.

198
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,208
The shuttle will reach that area
in approximately two minutes.

199
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,333
The Tamarian ship?

200
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,417
DATA:
Unchanged, sir.

201
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,291
They appear to be making
no attempt to stop us.

202
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,375
Maybe we called their bluff.

203
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:56,667
Status, Mr. Worf.

204
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,291
WORF:
Navigational, life-support,

205
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,000
propulsion normal.

206
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,375
Onboard systems do not appear
to be disrupted by the field

207
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:04,375
but I can barely
read you, Commander.

208
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:06,041
RIKER:
Acknowledged.

209
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,458
Maintain communication
as long as conditions permit.

210
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,375
Commander, I am reading
a power surge

211
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,125
in the Tamarian
plasma reactor.

212
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,333
Lieutenant Worf,
evasive maneuver sequence delta.

213
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,792
RIKER:
Maneuver sequence delta...

214
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,792
Commander,
the shuttle has been hit.

215
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,375
Damage?

216
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,709
The starboard nacelle
has been rendered inoperable.

217
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,709
That's all?

218
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,083
Riker to Worf.

219
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,667
Report.

220
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,709
Starboard thrusters
destroyed.

221
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,250
I may be able to land

222
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,125
but I will not be able
to take off.

223
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,625
RIKER:
Understood.

224
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:50,500
Return to the<i> Enterprise,</i>
Mr. Worf.

225
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:52,375
Aye, sir.

226
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,709
Enough to turn them back
but not enough to hurt them.

227
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,417
DATA:
Yes, sir.

228
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,875
The phaser pulse appears to have
been carefully attenuated

229
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,583
for just that effect.

230
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,875
Nice shooting.

231
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,208
LA FORGE:
I'm pretty sure
I can punch up

232
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,834
the annular confinement beam
enough to transport

233
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,542
the captain
through the field

234
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,458
but it's going to take me
at least a full day to do it.

235
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,709
Captain Picard
could be dead by then.

236
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,125
WORF:
I do not believe so.

237
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,875
I have confidence
in his ability as a warrior.

238
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,625
He will be victorious.

239
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:30,166
You're still assuming this is
some kind of challenge ritual.

240
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,291
We can't be
certain of that.

241
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,041
Agreed.

242
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,750
We're only making educated
guesses about their motivations

243
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,375
no more than that.

244
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:39,917
Then why do we wait?

245
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,291
If we attack
the ship now

246
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,500
they will not
be able to maintain

247
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,166
their scattering field.

248
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,750
Which might start a shooting
match and for all we know a war.

249
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,875
And we might still not be able
to save the captain.

250
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,709
It would end
this stalemate.

251
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,208
It's too much
of a risk.

252
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,417
I'll take that course
when it's the last one left.

253
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,750
Who the hell
are these people?

254
00:16:58,792 --> 00:16:59,750
There's got to be some way

255
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,583
to get through to them.

256
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,375
As I have said,
with further study,

257
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:04,458
it may be possible to...

258
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,583
Then do it.
Deanna, help him.

259
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,834
I want something
by 0900 hours.

260
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,166
Now where have you gone to,
my friend?

261
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,250
Forgive the intrusion, Captain
but I need some answers.

262
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:44,083
Darmok at Tanagra.
Shaka! Mirab.

263
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,333
His sails unfurled.

264
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,166
Darmok.
Mirab.

265
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,417
DATA:
Freeze.

266
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,000

268
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,959
"Darmok."

269
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,125
Well, it seems to be a point
of contention between them.

270
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,625
Perhaps something
the Tamarian captain proposed

271
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,125
that the first officer
didn't like.

272
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,667
The apparent emotional dynamic

273
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:11,458
does seem to support
that assumption.

274
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
As with the other terms
used by the Tamarian

275
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,625
this appears to be
a proper noun.

276
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,875
The name clearly carries
a meaning for them.

277
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:21,166
Computer, search
for the term "Darmok"

278
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,333

Stop search.

Computer, how many entries
are there for "Darmok"?

287
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,792
COMPUTER:
Forty-seven.

288
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

289
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,333
All our technology

290
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,208
our universal translator,
our years in space

291
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,041
contact with more
alien cultures

292
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,333
than I can even remember.

293
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:04,291
I have encountered
1,754 non-human races

294
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,834
during my tenure
in Starfleet.

295
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,959
And we still can't even
say hello to these people.

296
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,375
Correct.

297
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:19,250
A single word can lead
to tragedy

298
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,041
one word misspoken
or misunderstood

299
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:26,208
and that could happen here,
Data, if we fail.

I think we've got something.

A captain's log?

Darmok!

320
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,083
I was curious.
I meant no harm.

Shaka! Temba.

322
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,792
His arms wide. Temba.

323
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:24,417
No. Enough! I'm not
going to fight you.

324
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:28,333
You will just have...

Darmok and Jalad

329
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,625
I'll go along
with that.

330
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:05,834
(<i> roaring</i> )

331
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,041
Commander,
sensors are picking up

332
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,458
an electromagnetic disturbance

333
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,917
approaching
the captain's position.

334
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,083
Analysis?

335
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,834
A variable induction field--

336
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,166
possibly
a life-form.

337
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,917
How close is it
to the captain?

338
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:30,166
The field is erratic--
appearing and disappearing--

339
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,417
but it appears
to be moving toward him.

340
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,333
Attacking?

341
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,375
Riker to La Forge.

342
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:39,625
La Forge here.

343
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,333
How close are we
on that transporter?

344
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,500
Two hours, maybe three.

345
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,166
I want the captain
out of there now!

346
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,000
That's not
very likely, sir.

347
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,542
I don't want to hear that,
Commander.

348
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,250
Lefler,

349
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,208
what's
the resonance frequency?

350
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,834
.34 over standard.

351
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,834
I want
a resolution of .53

352
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,250

353
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,375
Commander, I'll need about
two more minutes.

354
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:04,500
But there's a good chance
this isn't going to work.

355
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:05,667
If it fails...

356
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:07,041
I know.

357
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:10,625
We will have tipped our hand
to the Tamarians.

358
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,166
But that's a chance
we have to take.

359
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,000
Agreed.

360
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,709
La Forge, proceed.

361
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,667
We're on it.
La Forge out.

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,291
O'Brien here,
Commander.

364
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,083
RIKER:
Stand by, Mr. O'Brien.

365
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,125
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

366
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,417
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

367
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,875
Mirab.
His sails unfurled?

368
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:41,875
Come.

369
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:44,250
Shaka.
When the walls fell.

370
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,959
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

371
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:51,625
(<i> sighs</i> )

372
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:54,834
Shaka.
When the walls fell.

373
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,583
Shaka...
you said that before

374
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,083
when I was trying
to build a fire.

375
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,375
Is that a failure?

376
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:01,959
An inability
to do something?

377
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,291
Darmok and Jalad...
At Tanagra.

378
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,291
I remember the words

379
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,875
but I don't understand.

380
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,083
(<i> loud crackling</i> )

381
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,625
Matrix levels?

382
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:16,083
Annular convergence
439.205.

383
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:19,083
Confinement
resolution .527.

384
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,583
That isn't
going to do it.

385
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,917
Increase thermal input
coefficient to 150%.

386
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,208
Increasing now.

387
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,417
RIKER:
Status, La Forge.

388
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:29,291
We're almost there, Commander.

389
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,583
Lefler,

390
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,083
shunt the overload

391
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,875
to the phase transition
sequencers in Transporter One.

392
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:36,834
Yes, sir.
La Forge to O'Brien.

393
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,166
Go ahead, Commander.

394
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,417
LA FORGE:
Confirm phase sequencer linkage.

395
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,542
Link confirmed.

396
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:48,000
Ready whenever you are, sir.

397
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:56,542
(<i> roaring</i> )

398
00:24:56,583 --> 00:25:00,709
Uzani.
His army at Lashmir.

399
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,875
At Lashmir.

400
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:04,750
Was it like this
at Lashmir?

401
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:05,834
A similar situation

402
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,667
to the one
we're facing here?

403
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,166
(<i> loud crackling</i> )

404
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,208
(<i> crackling stops</i> )

405
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:13,458
Uzani...

406
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,208
his army with fist open.

407
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:21,083
A strategy?
With fist open?

408
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,250
With fist open.

409
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:26,083
His army with fists closed.

410
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,875
With fists
closed?

411
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:31,250
An army with fists opened...

412
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,375
to lure the enemy...

413
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:35,709
with fists closed...

414
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,959
to attack?

415
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,417
That's how you communicate,
isn't it--

416
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:42,208
by citing example.

417
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,667
By metaphor!

418
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,792
Uzani's army with...

419
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:49,667
with fist open.

420
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:51,000
Sokath!

421
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:54,208
His eyes uncovered!

422
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,208

(<i> groans</i> )

426
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:17,041
No! No!

427
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,417
I've got a piece of him,
Commander, but that's all.

428
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,250
Boost the confinement beam!

429
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,667
157 over standard.

430
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:28,792
It's as solid as it'll go,
Commander.

431
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,125
(<i> groans</i> )

432
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:35,959
(<i> groaning</i> )

433
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:44,709
The Tamarian and the entity
are in close proximity.

434
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,417
The Tamarian's life signs
are fluctuating.

435
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:50,083
The scattering field is
still in full force.

436
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,208
What the<i> hell</i> is wrong
with them?

437
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,834
Their sensors can read what's
going on as well as ours can.

438
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,750
Riker to O'Brien. Report.

439
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:59,750
The field's
still deflecting the signal.

440
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:02,041
There just isn't
enough of him, sir.

441
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,834
Open a channel
to the Tamarian ship.

442
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,208
Aye, sir.

443
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,250
RIKER:
Your captain is under attack.

444
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,458
Drop your particle field.

445
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,959
Kailash...
when it rises.

446
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,208
They have closed
the channel.

447
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,625
O'Brien to Bridge.

448
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:20,542
I can't hold him, Commander.

449
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:22,542
(<i> electronic crackling</i> )

450
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:35,083
(<i> gasping</i> )

451
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:37,875
Shaka...

452
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:40,250
When the walls fell.

453
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:55,417
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45048.8.</i>

454
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,959
<i>Our attempt to transport</i>

455
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,125
<i>Captain Picard back to the ship</i>
<i>has failed.</i>

456
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,083
<i>My options are narrowing,</i>

457
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,834
<i>and my patience</i>
<i>is all but gone.</i>

458
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,250
Here's the situation
on El-Adrel.

459
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,500
The entity has moved off
several hundred meters.

460
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:14,792
CRUSHER:
Captain Picard's bioscan
readings are stable.

461
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:16,166
The Tamarian's are not.

462
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,667
He may be injured.

463
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,458
RIKER: if the entity decides
to attack again

464
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,125
the captain
may be facing it alone.

465
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,291
Well, the transporter's
out of the question.

466
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,625
The Tamarians have deepened
the scattering field

467
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,458
to the D region
of the ionosphere.

468
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,583
There's no
getting through.

469
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,291
Unless we attack
the ship itself.

470
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,709
Are you able to pinpoint the
source of their particle beam?

471
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,750
They're using
a polarity coil generator

472
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:36,083
located after
their warp drive.

473
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,375
It's pretty heavily shielded.

474
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,000
Could we get through
with our phasers?

475
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:40,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

476
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:42,625
Not with the first spread.
It take a couple of hits.

477
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,291
RIKER:
That's not good enough.

478
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:48,000
I need to knock out their
scattering field with one shot.

479
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,542
Get the captain back
onto the<i> Enterprise</i>

480
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:50,750
before they know
what happened.

481
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:52,417
LA FORGE:
If we selectively target

482
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:54,125
the amplification pathways
around the generator

483
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,709
it should be just as effective.

484
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,125
And we could do it
in one burst.

485
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,709
How long will that take
to set up?

486
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,166
Worf and I would have to
adjust the pre-fire chamber.

487
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,750
That would give us
the focus we need.

488
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:03,875
A few hours?

489
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:06,625
Make it so.

490
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:11,375
I would prefer to find
a peaceful solution.

491
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,959
If we could talk our way
out of this one

492
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,291
that much the better.

493
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,834
Unfortunately,
it may not be that simple.

494
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:18,542
What did you find out?

495
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:21,542
The Tamarian ego structure
does not seem to allow

496
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:24,166
what we normally think
of as self-identity.

497
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:27,375
Their ability to abstract
is highly unusual.

498
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:29,959
They seem to communicate
through narrative imagery--

499
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,625
a reference to the individuals
and places which appear

500
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:34,834
in their mythohistorical
accounts.

501
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:39,250
It's as if I were to say to you,
"Juliet on her balcony."

502
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,041
An image of romance.

503
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,500
Exactly.

504
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:45,250
Imagery is everything
to the Tamarians.

505
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:48,166
It embodies
their emotional states

506
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:50,959
their very thought processes.

507
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's how they communicate

508
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,458
and it's how
they think.

509
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,375
If we know how they think

510
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:56,917
shouldn't we be able to get
something across to them?

511
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,250
No, sir.

512
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,542
The situation is
analogous to understanding

513
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:03,917
the grammar of a language
but none of the vocabulary.

514
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:05,500
If I didn't know who Juliet was,

515
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:07,792
or what she was doing on
that balcony

516
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:10,125
the image alone
wouldn't have any meaning.

517
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:11,917
TROI:
That's correct.

518
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:16,458
For instance, we know the Darmok
was a great hero, a hunter,

519
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,166
and that Tanagra was an island,
but that's it.

520
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:23,417
Without the details,
there's no understanding.

521
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:27,041
It is necessary for us
to learn the narrative

522
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,500
from which the Tamarians
draw their imagery.

523
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:33,208
Given our current relations,
that does not appear likely.

524
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:52,041
Darmok and Jalad...
at Tanagra.

525
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:59,291
Our situation
is similar to theirs.

526
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,291
I understand that.

527
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:04,250
But I need to know more.

528
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:09,291
You must tell me more
about Darmok and Jalad.

529
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,792
Tell me...

530
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:19,166
You used the words
"Temba, his arms wide"

531
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:24,709
when you gave me
the knife and the fire.

532
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,667
Could that mean give?

533
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:30,458
Temba?
His arms wide.

534
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,667
Darmok.

535
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:36,500
Give me more
about Darmok.

536
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:40,917
Darmok on the ocean.

537
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,750
Darmok.

538
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,041
Darmok.

539
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,709
The ocean.

540
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,750
Darmok on the ocean.

541
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:07,291
A metaphor
for being alone?

542
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:10,083
Isolated?

543
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:12,333
Darmok on the ocean.

544
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:14,291
(<i> groans</i> )

545
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,542
You all right?

546
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:29,792
Kiazi's children.
Their faces wet.

547
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,667
Temba. His arms open.

548
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,959
Give me more about
Darmok on the ocean.

549
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:48,250
Tanagra on the ocean.

550
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:51,083
Darmok at Tanagra.

551
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:56,750
At Tanagra?
A country?

552
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:59,625
Tanagra on the ocean?
An island?

553
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:01,625
Temba, his arms wide.

554
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,625
Jalad on the ocean.

555
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:07,583
Jalad at Tanagra.

556
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:10,208
Jalad at Tanagra.

557
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,917
He went to the same island
as Darmok.

558
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:21,875
Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.

559
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:27,709
The beast at Tanagra.

560
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,333
The beast?

561
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,834
There was a creature at Tanagra?

562
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:36,917
Darmok and Jalad,
the beast of Tanagra.

563
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:43,792
They arrive separately.

564
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:48,166
They... they struggle together
against a common foe.

565
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,208
The beast at Tanagra.

566
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:54,583
Darmok and Jalad
at Tanagra.

567
00:33:54,625 --> 00:34:00,583
Darmok and Jalad
on the ocean.

568
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:02,917
They left together.

569
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,709
Darmok and Jalad on the ocean.

570
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,667
The ocean...

571
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:13,166
Zinda!

572
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,500
His face black.

573
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:17,875
His eyes red.

574
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:19,959
(<i> groaning</i> )

575
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:28,792
Callimas at Bahar.

576
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,125
You hoped that something like
this would happen, didn't you?

577
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:45,542
You knew there was a dangerous
creature on this planet

578
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,875
and you knew from
the tale of Darmok

579
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:52,375
that a danger shared

580
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:56,667
might sometimes bring
two people together.

581
00:34:56,709 --> 00:35:00,875
Darmok and Jalad
at Tanagra.

582
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:06,834
You and me here... at El-Adrel.

583
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:12,041
Kira at Bashi.

584
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:14,667
Temba, his arms wide.

585
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:16,417
My turn?

586
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:20,417
No, I'm not much
of a storyteller.

587
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,542
Besides,
you wouldn't understand.

588
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:28,417
Shaka. When the walls fell.

589
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:31,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

590
00:35:31,709 --> 00:35:33,083
Perhaps that
doesn't matter.

591
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,500
You want
to hear it anyway.

592
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:40,875
There is a story--

593
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:43,625
a very ancient one
from Earth.

594
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:47,083
I'll try and remember it.

595
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,667
Gilgamesh, a king.

596
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,709
Gilgamesh, a king.

597
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,417
At Uruk.

598
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:05,291
He tormented his subjects.

599
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:08,250
He made them angry.

600
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,458
They cried out aloud

601
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,500
"Send us a companion
for our king.

602
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:17,917
Spare us from his madness."

603
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,750
Enkidu,

604
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:27,458
a wild man
from the forest

605
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,125
entered the city.

606
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:33,500
They fought
in the temple.

607
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:36,250
They fought in the streets.

608
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:41,959
Gilgamesh
defeated Enkidu.

609
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,041
They became great friends.

610
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:53,000
Gilgamesh
and Enkidu at Uruk.

611
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:56,250
At Uruk.

612
00:36:56,291 --> 00:37:02,208
The new friends went out
into the desert together

613
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:08,125
where the great bull of heaven
was killing men by the hundreds.

614
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:13,583
Enkidu caught the bull
by the tail.

615
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:16,667
Gilgamesh struck him
with his sword.

616
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:21,250
Gilgamesh.

617
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:24,208
They were victorious.

618
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:31,208
But Enkidu
fell to the ground,

619
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,834
struck down by the gods

620
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:39,917
and Gilgamesh
wept bitter tears saying,

621
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:43,917
"He who was my companion

622
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:49,625
"through adventure
and hardship

623
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,959
is gone forever."

<i>First Officer's Log,</i>

625
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:12,667
<i>Despite the risk of war</i>

626
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:16,000
<i>I have no choice</i>
<i>but to break the stalemate.</i>

627
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:18,041
Phasers nearly ready, sir.

628
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,417
Stand by to fire, Mr. Worf.

629
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:20,917
Commander,

630
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:24,166
the Tamarian's bioscan
is becoming unreadable.

631
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:25,875
He may be dead, sir.

632
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:31,959
If we know that,
so do the Tamarians.

633
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,959
Riker to La Forge.

634
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
La Forge here.

635
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,333
I need those phasers.

636
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:38,792
Sir, sensors are tracking
the entity.

637
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:41,250
It is approaching
Captain Picard's position.

638
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,417
(<i> roaring</i> )

639
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:58,041
I understand
your sacrifice, Captain.

640
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,750
(<i> roaring</i> )

641
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:04,834
Unfortunately, if our friend
out there has its way

642
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,583
no one will ever know
what you tried to do.

643
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:10,583
(<i> roaring</i> )

644
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,834
DATA:
Nine meters and closing.

645
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:29,041
The energy output of the entity
has doubled, Commander.

646
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,792
Six meters.

647
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:33,709
La Forge to Bridge.
You have phasers.

648
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,750
Fire!

649
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:42,458
Their particle beam emitters
are inoperative, sir.

650
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,542
Scattering field is down, sir.

651
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,667
O'Brien, energize.

652
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:56,792
We got him, Commander.

653
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:00,834
Maximum shields.

654
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,500
Aye, sir.

655
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,458
Red alert!

656
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,542
Starboard shields
holding at 52%.

657
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:13,792
Forward shields are gone.

658
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:15,125
Let's get out of here.

659
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:16,834
DATA:
That may not
be possible, sir.

660
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,667
The starboard nacelle
has sustained a direct hit.

661
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,500
Warp engines are off-line.

662
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:23,208
Go to impulse.
Back us off.

663
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,625
They are matching our maneuver,
sir, and firing.

664
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:32,000
Return fire, Mr. Worf.

665
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,375
Full phasers.

666
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:34,792
Firing, sir.

667
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,166
Their shields are holding.

668
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:40,583
They are firing again.

669
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,875
Our shields have failed.

670
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:48,792
Commander, we cannot
survive another hit.

671
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:50,583
(<i> door opening</i> )

672
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,875
Hail the Tamarian vessel.

673
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,208
Aye, Captain.

674
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,542
Zinda!

675
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,542
His face black, his eyes red.

676
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,083
Temarc.
The river Temarc!

677
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:07,458
In winter.

678
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,917
Darmok...

679
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:13,667
And Jalad at Tanagra.

680
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:20,333
Darmok...
and Jalad...

681
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,166
on the ocean.

682
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:24,750
Sokath! His eyes open.

683
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:29,667
The beast of Tanagra?

684
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:32,166
Uzani. His army.

685
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:35,500
Shaka. When the walls fell.

686
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:00,041
Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel.

687
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,291
Mirab, with sails unfurled.

688
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:14,750
Temba...
his arms open.

689
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:20,667
Temba...
at rest.

690
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,333
Thank you.

691
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,834
DATA:
Power has been restored, sir.

692
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,542
New friends, Captain?

693
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,625
I can't say,
Number One.

694
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:48,000
But at least
they're not new enemies.

695
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,583
I hope
I'm not intruding.

696
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:01,083
No, of course not,
Number One. Please.

697
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:04,709
The damage report's
ready for your review.

698
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,709
Thank you.

699
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,500
Greek, sir.

700
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,417
Oh...

701
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:20,625
the Homeric Hymns--

702
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:23,458
one of the root metaphors
of our own culture.

703
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,917
For the next time we
encounter the Tamarians?

704
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:30,375
More familiarity
with our own mythology

705
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:33,041
might help us
to relate to theirs.

706
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:42,000
The Tamarian was willing
to risk all of us

707
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:46,542
just for the hope
of communication...

708
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,458
connection.

709
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,709
Now the door is open
between our peoples.

710
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:56,166
That commitment meant more
to him than his own life.

711
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:01,208
Thank you, Number One.
