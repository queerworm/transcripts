<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41365.9:</i>

2
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:20,041
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has</i>
<i>been ordered to Starbase 74</i>

3
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,250
<i>in orbit around Tarsas III.</i>

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,041
<i>A routine maintenance check</i>
<i>of all systems will be made</i>

5
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,208
<i>and certain upgrades completed</i>

6
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:30,041
<i>including the holodeck,</i>
<i>with which we've had problems.</i>

7
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,000
<i>I anticipate a glowing report.</i>

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,834
<i>This ship has performed</i>
<i>magnificently--</i>

9
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,959
<i>beyond anyone's expectations.</i>

10
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,709
Coming into position.

11
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:50,375
Stand by to dock.

12
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,125
Ready to dock, sir.

13
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,959
Engage mooring beams,
and lock off.

14
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,250
Aye, sir.

15
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,041
And... docking complete.

16
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,125
Thank you, Number One.

17
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,083
Well done.

18
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,917
And...

19
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,709
well done, all.

20
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:37,709

approaching airlock five.

21
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,500
Commander Quinteros.

22
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,083
Request permission
to come aboard.

23
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,041
Granted. Welcome.

24
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,500
Captain.

25
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Commander Riker.

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,125
Commander.

27
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,458
You're late.
We expected you a week ago.

28
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:12,542
We were unexpectedly delayed
at Omicron Pascal.

29
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,625
Ah. Is there anything specific
you wish to report

30
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,709
or that we should
be aware of?

31
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:16,875
No, we're very pleased

32
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,208
with the operation
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

33
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,709
I knew you would be.

34
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,375
I was in charge of the team
which put it together.

35
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,000
Are these gentlemen the Bynars?

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,041
They're not gentlemen--
or ladies, Commander.

37
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,792
They're a unified pair.

38
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:30,542
They're always together.

39
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,792
This is One Zero

40
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,875
and this is Zero One.

41
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,542
They just finished upgrading
the computers on the<i> Wellington.</i>

42
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,542
Did a great job.

43
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,166
Your reputation
precedes you.

44
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,166
I'm very pleased you're going
to be improving our system.

45
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,417
It is a great pleasure

46
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:45,041
to work on such a large
mobile computer.

47
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,375
You have 48 hours,
because in 48 plus six

48
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,542
we have an appointment on
Pelleus V we must keep.

49
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,333
I thought we'd
have more time.

50
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,458
I'm sorry. This mission
can't be delayed.

51
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,000
If you want to
postpone the work...

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,542
Oh, no, this is
the best time

53
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,750
to do it.
We can complete

54
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,208
our work within
the time allotted.

55
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,041
They work very quickly,
but it'll be very tight.

56
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,041
Commander Riker and I
will stay on board

57
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,583
be available
should you need us.

58
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,041
Thank you, Captain.
I don't think

59
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,291
we'll need you until we're ready
for inspection.

60
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,125
The Bynars seem
perfect for this

61
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,500
even though
this is the first time

62
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,083
that I've ever
come in contact with them.

63
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,709
As I understand it,
over time

64
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,625
they have become
so interconnected

65
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,041
with the master computer
on their planet

66
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,500
that their language,
their thought patterns

67
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,291
have become as close
to binary as is possible

68
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,291
for organic beings.

69
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,834
It will be interesting

70
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:38,041
to see how they improve
a computer as advanced as ours.

71
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,250
Mm-hmm.

72
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,625
Bridge. Well, I have
a little work to finish up

73
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,667
then I'm going
to my cabin

74
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:47,083
I'm going
to put my feet up

75
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,125
I'm going to turn on
my personal relaxation light

76
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,166
and I'm going to lose myself
in the pages of some old novel.

77
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,542
What about you, Number One?
You've earned a rest.

78
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:58,583
I've never been very good
at organizing my time off.

79
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,250
Something'll turn up.
It always does.

80
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,417
(<i> rapid binary chattering</i> )

81
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:14,291
I'll be in my ready room.

82
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,458
And Number One...

83
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,291
good work.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,333
I thought there were
only going to be two of you.

85
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,583
Because of the limited time
allotted us

86
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,583
we need others.

87
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,792
Is there a problem?

88
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,375
Uh, no.
No. No problem.

89
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,500
Then why are you
acting so excited?

90
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,917
Because we, uh, have to...
we are... stacking

91
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:42,375
to reconfigure
the computer

92
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,709
to communicate
with itself

93
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,875
more efficiently
and at higher speeds.

94
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,542
You act like you
don't believe them.

95
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm not sure that I do.

96
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,291
Maybe it's nothing.

97
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,500
Perhaps it's just the way
another species behaves.

98
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,417
Maybe.

99
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,250
I'm going to stroll
around the ship.

100
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,583
You've got the Bridge.

101
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,750
Keep your eye on them.

102
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,083
Yes, sir.

103
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,333
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

104
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,458
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

105
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,417
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

106
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:51,083
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

107
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:56,083
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

108
00:05:56,083 --> 00:06:00,709
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

109
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,667
We've been challenged
to a friendly game

110
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:09,917
of parrises squares

111
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:11,667
by some of the
maintenance personnel.

112
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,458
Want to join us
on the starbase?

113
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,125
You've already got all
the players you need.

114
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,500
Oh, we can switch off.

115
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,041
No, you know, if you do
that in parrises squares

116
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,417
you lose the
rhythm of the game.

117
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,041
I can't talk you into
coming with us?

118
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,417
No, but win, all right?

119
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:23,875
The pride of the<i> Enterprise</i>
goes with you.

120
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,250
Rest assured, Commander

121
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,375
we will be victorious,
at whatever the cost.

122
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,542
Worf, it's just a game.

123
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,083
A friendly little
competition.

124
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,625
You work up a sweat,
you have a few laughs

125
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,375
and you make
new friends.

126
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:38,709
If winning is not important,
then, Commander, why keep score?

127
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,834
I think
he's pulling your leg.

128
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,375
Believe it or not

129
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,917
Worf is developing
a sense of humor.

130
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,458
I hope so,
for their sake.

131
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,083
Good luck.

132
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,375
(<i> machinery winding down</i> )

133
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,542

00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:09,166

COMPUTER:
Unoccupied sections
are being closed down

136
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:14,125
in order to clear space
in the main computer banks.

137
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,166
It is necessary to facilitate
the system upgrade.

138
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,792
Full power can be restored
if needed.

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,083
LA FORGE:
Well, what do you think?

140
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,709
RIKER:
Tell me what
it's supposed to be

141
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,125
and then I'll give you
my opinion.

142
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,250
It is an attempt
at pure creativity.

143
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,917
What we're investigating is,
can Data be creative?

144
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:42,291
And this is my attempt,
with guidance from Geordi.

145
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,291
I suggested the<i> zylo</i> eggs.

146
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,083
Is that what those are?

147
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,041
Keep notes.

148
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,500
This project may turn out to be

149
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,542
of interest to scholars
in the future.

150

LA FORGE:
Really?

151
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, of course.
Think about it.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,875
A blind man teaching
an android how to paint?

153
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,750
That's got to be worth
a couple of pages

154
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,583
in somebody's book.

155
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,083
You look like you're packing
to leave forever.

156
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,458
Oh, Commander Riker.

157
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,959
No, I'm just
gathering my notes.

158
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:27,000
Professor Terence Epstein is
at this starbase.

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,458
Is that someone
I should know of?

160
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:38,208
He's the leading mind
in cybernetics.

161
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,625
He lectured
at my medical school.

162
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:45,000
You know the disaster
at Micromius? Well...

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,542
since then, I've been working
on an approach

164
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:51,291
that combines cybernetics
and regeneration.

165
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,750
It sounds impossible,
I know

166
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,667
but I have found an approach
that will work.

167
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,750
I mean, what an opportunity!

168
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,125
To have a chance
to talk with Dr. Epstein.

169
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,709
Sorry, Will.

170
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:06,792
I'd love to chat
but I have to go.

171
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,000
How's it going?

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,542
We are almost done.
The deviation

173
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,959
caused by a previous
probe has been corrected.

174
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,083
You may use the equipment
anytime you wish.

175
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,709
How much has been changed?

176
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,250
What exactly did you do?

177
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,125
Enhancement.
Nothing more.

There's no one on duty here

359
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,458
and we're getting
some very strange readings

360
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,792
from the magnetic
containment field.

361
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:38,000
The field is
deteriorating.

362
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,542
Contact the Captain
immediately.

363
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:40,792
I am initiating red alert.

364
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,208
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

365
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,041
Data, I can't maintain
the integrity

366
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,417
of the containment
field.

367
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:47,458
Engineering to Captain.

368
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:50,834
If the antimatter
is released

369
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:52,291
the ship will be destroyed.

370
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,166
Nothing I do
has any effect.

371
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm losing it.

372
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,166
Data, I've rechecked
every circuit.

373
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,500
This is not a misread
by the computer.

374
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,917
Computer,
situation analysis.

375
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:07,500
COMPUTER:
Estimate release of antimatter
in four minutes, 18 seconds.

376
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,625
17 seconds.

377
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,500
16 seconds.

378
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,792
Engineering to Bridge.

379
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:13,834
This is the Bridge.

380
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:15,166
DATA:
Alert starbase.

381
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,542
Inform them we are
abandoning the ship.

382
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:18,834
Tell them why.

383
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,709
Initiate automated
sequence for departure.

384
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:22,917
Set course and speed
to put maximum distance

385
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:25,667
between the<i> Enterprise</i>
and any inhabited planets.

386
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:28,125
Shouldn't we wait
for the Captain's approval?

387
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,583
DATA:
There is no time.

388
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,667
Based on all information
presently available

389
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:33,667
the decision is correct.

390
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:36,792
This is Lieutenant Commander
Data speaking for the Captain.

391
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,583
Abandon ship.

392
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,291
This is not a drill.

393
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,834
All personnel,
this is not a drill.

394
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:45,542
I say again

395
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,208
abandon ship.

396
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:51,083
All personnel,
this is not a drill.

397
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,875
Abandon ship.

398
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:04,375
COMPUTER:
Decks two through four
to cargo transporters.

399
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,709
Decks five through ten

400
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:11,875
proceed to transporters
one, two, three and four.

401
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,709
Decks six through 16

402
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:17,125
proceed to transporters
five, six

403
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,917
seven, eight, nine and ten.

404
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,041
CREWMAN:
Hold your positions,
please.

405
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,417
Prepare to energize.

406
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:25,125
And energize.

407
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:30,208
COMPUTER:
...proceed to transporters
11, 12, 13 and 14.

408
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,375
Decks 29 through 42

409
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:35,542
proceed to transporters 15, 16

410
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:39,667
17, 18, 19 and 20.

411
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:44,417
This is not a drill.
This is not a drill.

412
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:48,125
CREWMAN:
Well, key it up again.

413
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,542
What's going on?

414
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:53,208
Please, stand
out of the way.

415
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,667
The<i> Enterprise</i> is
being evacuated.

416
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:55,750
Why?

417
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,083
Some problem
in Engineering.

418
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,250
Get a security team
together.

419
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,709
Aye, Lieutenant.

420
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,875
<i>Ship's Log, supplemental:</i>

421
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,041
<i>This is Lieutenant</i>
<i>Commander Data.</i>

422
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,625
<i>I have put the ship</i>
<i>on automated departure</i>

423
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,917
<i>and ordered the complete</i>
<i>evacuation of the</i> Enterprise.

424
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:17,875
<i>Everyone remaining is</i>
<i>leaving on foot or beaming off.</i>

425
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:20,750
Computer, where are the
Captain and Commander Riker?

426
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,750
COMPUTER:
All decks empty.

427
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,166
Curious.

428
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,834
The captain is usually
the last to leave.

429
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:28,375
Let's go.
We've only got
41 seconds.

430
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,417
I think we're the last.

431
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,709
I hope we are.

432
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:52,542
Did you see the Captain
and Commander Riker?

433
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:54,667
No. Are they not
here on Starbase?

434
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,083
YAR:
No. We thought that--

435
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,709
You mean they're still
on board the<i> Enterprise?</i>

436
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:00,166
Yes. Sir, where is
your transporter room?

437
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:02,000
We have to beam
back and get them.

438
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,166
You haven't time.

439
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,709
CREWMAN:
This is Starbase 74.

440
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:07,291
The<i> Enterprise</i> magnetic field
is regenerating.

441
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:09,041
Wait a minute.
How is that possible?

442
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,000
CREWMAN:
Unknown.

443
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,542
YAR:
That changes
nothing.

444
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:13,500
The Captain and Commander Riker
must be in trouble

445
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,709
or they'd be here.

446
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:18,625
Now, look-- your ship
is almost clear.

447
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:59,250
(<i> red alert sounding</i> )

448
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:15,542
And the boy
never found out?

449
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:17,083
Oh, yes, but not
until later

450
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:19,250
when he came back into the
room with his little sister.

451
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,583
Oh, I bet both of them
were all smiles.

452
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:24,333
Yes, but by that time, both
of them had been found out.

453
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:27,125
You handled that
in a very thoughtful way.

454
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,000
You're very good
with people.

455
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,375
Don't you agree, Jean-Luc?

456
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,542
She's so very different
from the other images

457
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:34,458
we've experienced
on the holodeck, isn't she?

458
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:37,875
She's... she's
more intuitive.

459
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:41,250
It's as though she'd been
plugged into my subconscious.

460
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,083
She already knows
what I want her to say

461
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,875
before<i> I'm</i> aware of it myself.

462
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,875
PICARD:
I suppose it's an
understandable progression.

463
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,166
Computers make decisions
based on input

464
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,083
and we humans give off

465
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,166
a multitude
of subtle signs that...

466
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:58,333
that communicate
our emotions.

467
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:01,333
It's uncanny.

468
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,959
I could develop
feelings for Minuet

469
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,500
exactly as I would
for any woman.

470
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,542
Doesn't love always
begin that way--

471
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:11,375
with the illusion
more real than the woman?

472
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:16,583
Oh, Jean-Luc, spoken
like a true Frenchman.

473
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,834
Well, I think I'll be leaving.

474
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:20,166
Oh! Don't go.

475
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,291
Two's company.

476
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:24,041
We have time.
There's no rush.

477
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,917
I'd really like it
if you would stay.

478
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:28,959
Yes, Captain, stay.

479
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,917
This is your diversion,
Number One, not mine.

480
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:34,000
Wait. We haven't danced.

481
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,250
I... I don't dance.

482
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,166
Then some more wine.

483
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:37,792
No, thank you.
Wait!

484
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:39,417
Please!
Please, don't go.

485
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,000
You can't. Not yet.

486
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,291
Why? What's the matter?
Why can't he leave?

487
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,375
Exit.

488
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,917
(<i> red alert sounding</i> )

489
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:55,291
Captain to Bridge.

490
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:57,542
Situation report.

491
00:28:57,542 --> 00:29:01,625
Riker to Bridge.

492
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,125
Computer, explain red alert.

493
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,291
COMPUTER:
Initiated as
a programmed response.

494
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:08,000
The magnetic field containing
the antimatter had weakened.

495
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,834
There was no
fail-safe available.

496
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:10,750
Why wasn't I notified?

497
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,834
COMPUTER:
Unknown.

498
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,291
Present condition?

499
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,834
COMPUTER:
The magnetic field
is now restored.

500
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:16,125
Containment is restored.

501
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,709
Propulsion is
at maximum efficiency.

502
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:20,291
Locate Lieutenant
Commander Data.

503
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,208
COMPUTER:
Not on board the<i> Enterprise.</i>

504
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,625
Explain.
COMPUTER:
All<i> Enterprise</i> personnel

505
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:27,667
except the Captain and First
Officer have been evacuated.

506
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:29,041
Evacuated?

507
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,750
Was the situation
that critical?

508
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,000
COMPUTER:
Yes.

509
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,333
Are we still docked
at the starbase?

510
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,709
No.

511
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:35,959
Position report.

512
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:41,625
Coordinates 4159.26
by 81921 by 312.

513
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:44,333
Heading, 233 mark 45.

514
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:45,667
Destination?

515
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:48,125
Planet Bynaus
in the Beta Magellan system.

516
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,333
The Bynars.

517
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,041
Am I to understand
the Bynars

518
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,458
have stolen
the<i> Enterprise?</i>

519
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,375
That information
is not available.

520
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:06,125
It's the Bynars,
and you're part of this.

521
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:08,166
Yes.

522
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:09,750
They made you the lure
to keep me here.

523
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,208
They programmed you
while I was relaxing.

524
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,709
Yes. When they saw
your interest in me

525
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:16,291
they thought I could distract
you and keep you here.

526
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,458
That explains Riker.
What about me?

527
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:21,041
Your being here was just
a fortunate happenstance.

528
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:22,250
What do they want with me?

529
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,583
What do they want
with the<i> Enterprise?</i>

530
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:25,000
What's their purpose?
I'm not programmed

531
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,542
to give you that information.

532
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,917
Come on, Number One.

533
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:31,458
We've got to regain control
of our ship.

534
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,500
Okay, so what
do we do?

535
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,375
Which is the nearest
Starfleet vessel?

536
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,500
The<i> Trieste.</i>

537
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,875
DATA:
I know the<i> Trieste--</i>
too small, too slow.

538
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:48,166
Plus it's 66 hours away.

539
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,417
Where are the Bynars?

540
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:54,667
I haven't seen them.

541
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:56,583
Then they are obviously
still aboard.

542
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:58,542
Another Starfleet vessel
must be sent

543
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:00,375
to intercept the<i> Enterprise</i>
at Bynaus.

544
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,291
They might be taking the ship
to their home planet.

545
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,875
What makes you think so?

546
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:07,333
It is the best place
for us to start.

547
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:20,458
Picard. Access.

548
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,291
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

549
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:34,208
<i>We know who has commandeered</i>
<i>the</i> Enterprise--<i> the Bynars.</i>

550
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,000
<i>We can't communicate</i>
<i>with the Bridge.</i>

551
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,458
<i>Commander Riker and I</i>

552
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:40,166
<i>will now try to regain control</i>
<i>of our ship.</i>

553
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,166
This way.

554
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,208
That's towards
Engineering.

555
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,625
That's our first step:

556
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:46,041
Verify containment
and initiate auto-destruct.

557
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,709
Initiate auto-destruct?

558
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:50,333
Our ship has been commandeered
by a force

559
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,041
of unknown size and intent.

560
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,375
We're here alone.

561
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,458
We must assume
the worst.

562
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,750
If we don't
regain control

563
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,959
then no one else
must have it, either.

564
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,834
Now...

565
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:05,208
this is the one decision

566
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,667
involving the operation
of this vessel

567
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,458
which requires you and I
to be in total agreement.

568
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:10,333
It's the time allotted
that concerns me.

569
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,750
As to that,
there's no option.

570
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,166
I know. It's a five-
minute countdown.

571
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,625
Well, that's sufficient
to get to the Bridge.

572
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,458
Once there, either we'll
get control of the vessel

573
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,208
shut off the auto-destruct
or we won't.

574
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:21,500
But this vessel must not
fall into hostile hands.

575
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,041
Then let's set it and get going.

576
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:31,000
COMPUTER:
Recognize Picard,

577
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,875
Jean-Luc, Captain.

578
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,500
Recognize Riker,

579
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,750
William T., Commander.

580
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,166
Set auto-destruct sequence.

581
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,083
COMPUTER:
Does the First Officer concur?

582
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:46,000
Yes, set auto-destruct
sequence... now.

583
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,959
COMPUTER:
Auto-destruct will detonate
in four minutes and 59 seconds.

584
00:32:56,125 --> 00:33:00,250
The only place we can stop this
is on the Bridge. Let's go.

585
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:03,875
What do you make of this, sir?

586
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,250
PICARD:
An enormous
amount of data

587
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,000
is being received
and stored

588
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,333
in the main
computer.

589
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,583
Just stored. Why?

590
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,500
That's another piece
of this puzzle.

591
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:27,750
COMPUTER:
Bridge access denied.

592
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,917
They've locked it off.

593
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:30,417
We must find another
way to get in.

594
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:31,875
One of us could beam
into the Bridge.

595
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,750
No. It takes several
seconds to materialize.

596
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,250
You wouldn't
stand a chance.

597
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,959
I could beam
into the turbolift

598
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:38,500
force the doors,
take them by surprise.

599
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,250
No. We'll both beam
in simultaneously

600
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,750
to different areas
of the Bridge.

601
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,917
With luck, one of us
will be a distraction.

602
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,458
There must be only
four minutes left.

603
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,208
Still no response
from the<i> Enterprise.</i>

604
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:53,542
They would answer
if they could.

605
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:56,500
Someone else has
control of the ship.

606
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,125
Do you think
I am responsible?

607
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,875
Responsible?

608
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,166
How could you
possibly have known?

609
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,291
My station is
on the Bridge.

610
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:06,375
You can't be on the Bridge
every second, Data.

611
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,875
You are wrong, Geordi.
I can.

612
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:11,542
I do not need rest or diversion.

613
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:14,959
I should not have been painting.

614
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:16,959
I was negligent.

615
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:18,834
YAR:
That's a pointless
discussion, Data.

616
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:20,583
You could have been
on the Bridge

617
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:22,291
and it still
might have happened.

618
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:25,750
Commander Quinteros, you
have three ships in here.

619
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,083
We need one of them now.

620
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,166
We're rushing repairs
on the USS<i> Melbourne</i>

621
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:32,000
but it's still 18 hours
until she'll be ready.

622
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,750
There's nothing else you can do.

623
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,709
Set coordinates
for main Bridge.

624
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:49,291
Port forward for me,
aft for you.

625
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:51,083
You're on pad two.

626
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:53,041
I've set a ten-second delay.

627
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,875
Set phasers on stun.

628
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:01,458
Number One, good luck.

629
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:19,458
Over here, Captain.

630
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,750
Why did you steal my ship?

631
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:46,875
Please...
try... to...

632
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:50,500
help... us.

633
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,083
Cancel auto-destruct.

634
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,792
COMPUTER:
Does the First Officer agree?

635
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,041
Affirmative.

636
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,375
COMPUTER:
Auto-destruct, cancel.

637
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,583
We're in orbit
around Bynaus.

638
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,125
How are they?

639
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:31,000
They appear dead.

640
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,542
Let's see if we can get
some answers from Bynaus.

641
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:38,000
Their main computer is off.

642
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,458
All sensors reveal

643
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,625
that all the equipment
on their planet is inert.

644
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:44,000
They can neither send
nor receive any messages.

645
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,417
What about all those people
down there

646
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:46,792
who are totally dependent
on their computer?

647
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:48,208
Are they still
functioning?

648
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:51,000
They're probably
like these Bynars here, dying.

649
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,834
What is this all about?

650
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:56,333
Why did they steal the ship
and bring it here?

651
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,792
What is their purpose?

652
00:36:57,792 --> 00:36:58,875
They went to an awful
lot of trouble

653
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,000
to clear computer space.

654
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,291
Let's see what they stored.

655
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,250
Captain, it's enormous.

656
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,125
Every byte of free space
in the computer

657
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,458
has been filled.

658
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,000
They must have
made a core dump

659
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,083
from their world
into our computer.

660
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:15,458
(<i> warning beep</i> )

661
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:17,083
I can't get in.

662
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:21,375
I wish they'd left a note.

663
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,959
Maybe they did.

664
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:25,125
Minuet.

665
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:36,125
Tell me what
this is all about.

666
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,291
A star in the Bynar system
went supernova

667
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,291
and they miscalculated.

668
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,250
The electrical magnetic pulse
from the explosion

669
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,041
was going to knock out
their main computer.

670
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:47,208
And so their only choice

671
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,625
was to transfer
all the stored information

672
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:51,208
and shut down until
after it passed

673
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,291
and then reactivate
their system

674
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:55,542
and transfer the information
back to the main computer.

675
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:57,792
The<i> Enterprise</i> has
the only mobile computer

676
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:59,750
large enough to handle
all that information.

677
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,750
So what went wrong?

678
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,375
Why are they dying?

679
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,959
The star went supernova
before it was expected

680
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:08,041
and you were late arriving
at Starbase 74.

681
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:12,291
Why didn't they
say something?

682
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,542
Why didn't they
just ask for help?

683
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,667
I don't know.

684
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:18,125
I don't have
those answers.

685
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:19,417
Is there anything
we can do?

686
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:21,166
Yes, return the data

687
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,667
stored on the
<i>Enterprise's</i> computer

688
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,500
back to the one on Bynaus.

689
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,542
How can we do that?

690
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:26,959
You don't know?

691
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:28,417
Yes, if I had the file name.
But we don't. Do you?

692
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:31,458
I don't know
what you're talking about.

693
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:33,959
They wouldn't
intentionally hide it,

694
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:35,542
make it difficult
for us to find.

695
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:37,041
It must be right
in front of our faces.

696
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,709
We should contact
Starbase 74

697
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:40,166
and see if anyone
can decipher this.

698
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,208
They're dying.

699
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:42,750
They meant you no harm.

700
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,417
It was their world
they were trying to save.

701
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:48,875
Help them, Will. Hurry.

702
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:50,959
Please.

703
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:01,500
Starbase 74, this
is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

704
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,792
Do you read me?

705
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:05,250
This is Starbase 74.

706
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,125
Captain Picard,
what is your situation?

707
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,625
We'll go into that later.

708
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:11,000
Right now, I must speak to
Lieutenant Commander Data.

709
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,291
DATA:
I am here, sir.

710
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:13,792
Data, the Bynars have stored

711
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:16,125
an enormous amount of
material in our computer.

712
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,959
We need to access
it and we can't.

713
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:20,834
The access would be available
by code or password.

714
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:23,542
Yes, I know that, Data,
but what could it be?

715
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:25,667
File names can be anything, sir.

716
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,125
They want us to find it.

717
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,458
They would have kept it simple.

718
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:31,750
Then a name or a place.

719
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,625
It could be something personal.

720
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:35,333
In this case,
in binary language,

721
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,000
which is ones and zeros

722
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,834
in groups of eight
or 16 characters.

723
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:41,125
Would they have kept it
that simple?

724
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,500
Try it. Picard out.

725
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,542
(<i> keypad beeping</i> )

726
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,041
That's the file.
It'll work now.

727
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:01,166
Now access the file.
Start the transfer.

728
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,458
So much for that idea.

729
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:10,250
PICARD:
Let me get on the
other position.

730
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,750
The Bynars
always work in pairs.

731
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,667
Maybe that is
also required.

732
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,250
Uh-huh.

733
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,583
It appears to be successful.

734
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:30,625
Their system has started up.

735
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:33,208
Their resident diagnostic
program is running.

736
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:38,250
Their system
is absolutely incredible.

737
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:01,417
(<i> rapid binary chattering</i> )

738
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,208
-Our world
-is reactivated.

739
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:06,500
-Our people
-express their gratitude.

740
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,208
-We will return to
-your starbase for whatever

741
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:12,458
-punishment your system
-requires of us.

742
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,583
Why didn't you just
ask for our help?

743
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:17,583
(<i> rapid binary chattering</i> )

744
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:24,083
-You might have
-said no.

745
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:27,291
There was a chance
we would have said yes.

746
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:29,917
-Our need was too great
-to risk rejection.

747
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:32,083
And so you stole it.

748
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:35,166
Their reason was part
of the binary thinking.

749
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:37,583
For them there are
only two choices.

750
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:39,125
One or zero, yes or no.

751
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,625
Why did you lure me
to the holodeck

752
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:42,959
and hold me there?

753
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,750
-Because we knew we might die

754
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,125
-and we needed someone

755
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,834
-to restore our computer
-and you did.

756
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:50,208
No one has been hurt.

757
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,250
You've achieved
your objective.

758
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,834
You have your planet
back in order.

759
00:41:54,834 --> 00:41:56,834
We have our ship.

760
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:07,625
Well, it's been some time
since I had the conn.

761
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,667
But not to worry, Number One.

762
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:12,625
You're in good hands.

763
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,959
Starbase 74.

764
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,291
Warp two.

765
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:21,125
Engage.

766
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,125
Everything's under control.

767
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:39,417
CREWMAN:
<i>USS</i> Enterprise<i> has cleared</i>
<i>the starbase perimeter.</i>

768
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:56,458
Is everything all right?

769
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:58,166
We're fine.
Everything is in order.

770
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:02,125
But now I want a complete check:
all systems, all divisions.

771
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:04,083
What about the Bynars?

772
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,208
Hand them over to Quinteros.
There will be a hearing.

773
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,458
-We understood that
-would happen.

774
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,875
Follow me,
please.

775
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:12,834
While these things
are being checked

776
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:14,291
permission to leave
the Bridge, sir.

777
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,375
Permission granted.

778
00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:27,041
What<i> is</i> a knockout like you

779
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:30,625
doing in a computer-generated
gin joint like this?

780
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,959
You're not Minuet.

781
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:01,250
She's gone.

782
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,125
I tried variations
on the program.

783
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:06,375
Others appeared,
but not Minuet.

784
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:11,166
Maybe it was all part
of the Bynars' programming.

785
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:17,041
But you know, Number One, some
relationships just can't work.

786
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:21,250
Yes, probably true.

787
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,291
She'll be difficult
to forget.
