1
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,500
Report.

2
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:13,458
There's an object of some kind
closing in on our position.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,834
On screen.

4
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:18,667
DATA:
It appears
to be an unmanned probe.

5
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:21,250
Approximately one-half
meter in diameter.

6
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,458
There are
no identifiable armaments.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,291
Captain,
we are being...

8
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,750
<i>You</i> are being hailed,
by name.

9
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:31,500
Open a channel.

10
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:33,333
This is Captain
Jean-Luc Picard of...

11
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,041
Captain, I am reading
a power surge.

12
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,750
Shields up.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,458
DATA:
The beam appears to contain

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,709
holographic imaging
information.

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,458
It's trying
to project something.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,834
Isolate
the bandwidth.

17
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,417
Let the signal
through the shields.

18
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,250
Bok.

19
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,625
I trust you remember
me, Picard,

20
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,375
because I haven't
forgotten you

21
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:02,125
or how you murdered
my son.

22
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,000
For 15 years now,
I've thought

23
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:07,250
about how to avenge his death,
but nothing I could do to you

24
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:11,208
could equal what you did
to me-- until now.

25
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,959
You thought you could
hide him from me, didn't you?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,875
But I found out
about him.

27
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:18,834
Jason Vigo is
as good as dead.

28
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,625
I'm going to kill
your son, Picard,

29
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,458
just like you
killed mine.

30
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:04,500
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

31
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:08,834
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

32
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,375
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

33
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:14,208
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

34
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,917
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

35
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,792
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

36
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:23,000
Mr. Worf, put a tractor beam
on that probe.

37
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,458
Determine if it's safe
to beam it on board.

38
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,166
I want to know
where it came from.

39
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,417
Mr. Data,

40
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,333
see if there is any mention

41
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,542
of a Jason Vigo

42
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,834
in Federation records.

43
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,041
You might start

44
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,458
with Miranda Vigo.

45
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,667
She was born on New Gaul

46
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,083
about 50 years ago.

47
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,500
Aye, sir.

48
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:43,875
Number one,

49
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:45,125
contact the Ferengi government.

50
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,834
Find out
all you can about Bok.

51
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,250
He was wearing
a daimon's uniform.

52
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,875
If he has regained his rank,
I want to know why.

53
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,083
(<i> door chimes</i> )

54
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,709
Come.

55
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,208
The Ferengi
government

56
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,250
is debating an amendment
to the Rules of Acquisition.

57
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,709
It could be a while
before we hear from them.

58
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,625
Data found out that
the woman you mentioned

59
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,250
has a son
named Jason.

60
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,041
This is the most recent
picture we could find.

61
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,208
(<i> sighs</i> )

62
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,792
How old is
the boy now?

63
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:33,041
Twenty-three.

64
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,291
He and his mother left Earth
12 years ago.

65
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,333
They settled on Camor V.
That's all we know.

66
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,500
The planet's records
are virtually nonexistent.

67
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:44,166
Picard to Bridge.

68
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,083
Set a course for
the Camor System,
warp five.

69
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,417
Aye, sir.

70
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,458
Will...

71
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,625
I do appreciate
your not asking

72
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:01,125
but I do think you have
a right to know.

73
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:05,458
There is a possibility
that the boy is my son.

74
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:12,083
I was involved with his mother
for a short time about...

75
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,625
well, 24 years ago.

76
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:16,834
We met through a friend

77
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,542
when I was on shore leave
on Earth.

78
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,834
It was, uh...

79
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,667
all very romantic,
very intense,

80
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,041
probably because we both knew

81
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,375
that I would be leaving
in two weeks.

82
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:33,125
And we kept
in touch for a while,

83
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,417
but we never managed
to get together again.

84
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,667
She never said anything
to you about being pregnant?

85
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:41,875
No.

86
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:45,709
So either Bok is wrong,
and I'm not the father,

87
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,500
or Miranda decided
to raise the child alone.

88
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:51,959
Which, quite frankly,
wouldn't surprise me.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,417
She was
very independent...

90
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,625
very strong-willed.

91
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:02,375
She would have to be
to get by on Camor V.

92
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:05,959
But whether he's my son
or not, he is in danger.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,041
Bok tried to kill me six years
ago and I don't doubt

94
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,291
that he will try to make good
his threat against the boy.

95
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,125
Anything?

96
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,959
There are no Ferengi vessels
within range of our scanners.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,375
Captain, I am unable
to find any information

98
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,667
on Jason Vigo's
current whereabouts.

99
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,875
What about
his mother?
No, sir.

100
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,166
Miranda was trained
as a botanist.

101
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,500
She always used to talk
about running a farm one day.

102
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:40,125
Maybe we should concentrate
on the agricultural areas.

103
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,333
That would significantly
narrow our search.

104
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,083
The only cultivated land is
on the southern continent

105
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,542
and there are relatively
few people engaged

106
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,291
in agricultural
activities.

107
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,625
There cannot be many
non-Camorites among them.

108
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,667
Scan for
human life signs.

109
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,625
DATA:
I am detecting eight humans.

110
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,166
Three are female.

111
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,625
However, they are all too young
to be Miranda Vigo.

112
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,375
What about males?

113
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,417
One is an infant.

114
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,041
Another
is elderly.

115
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,709
Two are middle-aged.

116
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,875
That's seven.
You said there were eight.

117
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:16,834
I am having difficulty getting
a clear reading on the eighth.

118
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,959
The individual appears to be
approximately two kilometers

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,792
beneath the
planet's surface.

120
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:23,041
Male or female?

121
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,417
Male.

122
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,083
Between 20 and 30 years old.

123
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,792
No one in their
right mind

124
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:29,959
would go that far
underground alone.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,583
Unless he were
forced to.

126
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,625
Captain, I am reading seismic
instability in the area.

127
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,083
He is in danger.

128
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,709
Relay his coordinates
to the transporter room.

129
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,542
Have them beam him
aboard.

130
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,083
DATA:
Aye, sir.

131
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,417
(<i> whoosh of active transport</i> )

132
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,709
What the...?

133
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,375
This is a
Federation ship.

134
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,625
That's right.

135
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,709
I'm Captain Picard,
Jean-Luc Picard.

136
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,333
I realize I wasn't supposed
to be spelunking that cave,

137
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,083
but don't you have
something better to do?

138
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,750
We thought
you were at risk.

139
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,375
Oh.
Well, I wasn't.

140
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:15,083
So maybe you should just
beam me back where I was.

141
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,250
Are you Jason Vigo?

142
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,500
I, uh...

143
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,375
I know him.

144
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,875
Is he in trouble?

145
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:25,083
In a manner
of speaking.

146
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,750
Someone has made a threat
against his life.

147
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,875
Jason,

148
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:36,083
I'm an old friend
of your mother's.

149
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,166
I'm here
because you're in danger.

150
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,834
Why would anybody
want to kill me?

151
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,208
The person
who has made the threat

152
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,834
is under the impression
that you...

153
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,041
are<i> my</i> son.

154
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,542
Am I?

155
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,041
I don't know.

156
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,875
My mother never told me
who my father was--

157
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,709
just that he
was in Starfleet.

158
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,625
Maybe we should
contact her.

159
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:11,083
She, uh... she died
a few years ago.

160
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,917
Oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,667
Jason, I think
it's important

162
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:23,125
that we find out
one way or the other.

163
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,667
Would you be willing
to permit a genetic test?

164
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,917
If I'm not your son,

165
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,917
is this person still
going to want to kill me?

166
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,375
I doubt it.

167
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,875
In that case, you
won't mind my saying

168
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:38,041
that I hope you're
not my father.

169
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,542
What were you doing
in the caves, Jason?

170
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,208
Are you
a seismologist?

171
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,458
No, I just
enjoy climbing.

172
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,208
Without an antigrav
harness?

173
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,166
No, they get
in the way.

174
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:16,375
So,
what do you do?

175
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:19,291
Um... I'm between jobs
right now.

176
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,125
I see.

177
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,959
Excuse me, gentlemen.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,166
The test results are ready
if you'd like to hear them.

179
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,417
Your genetic code
is a cross between the DNA

180
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:41,083
of your mother, Miranda Vigo,
and your father,

181
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,417
Jean-Luc Picard.

182
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,625
What's all this?

183
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,625
Oh, these are
archaeological fragments

184
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,333
that I've collected
over the years.

185
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,917
This is
a Silvan glyph stone.

186
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,709
And, um, this is...

187
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,542
This is a Gorlan
prayer stick.

188
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:25,125
It's really
quite rare.

189
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,583
Is it valuable?

190
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,125
Oh, not really.

191
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,375
Only to students
of archaeology such as myself.

192
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:34,667
Though, I did have
to hand over a bottle

193
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:37,834
of very old Saurian brandy
for it.

194
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,333
I'd say you got taken.

195
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,792
Well, perhaps.

196
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:46,583
But it's of value
to me nonetheless.

197
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:50,625
On Camor, something has value
if you can eat it or sell it.

198
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:53,542
Everything else
is luxury.

199
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,166
Would you like
some tea?

200
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,125
No... thanks.

201
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,792
Something else?

202
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,500
No.

203
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:06,208
Tea, Earl Grey,
hot.

204
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,875
I'm sure that
this whole thing

205
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:11,959
is as much of a surprise
to you as it is to me.

206
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,792
I really want to be
honest with you, Jason.

207
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:22,709
I only knew your mother
for a very short time.

208
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,125
I-I would have liked
to have known her better...

209
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,333
It just didn't
work out that way.

210
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,583
You look a lot
like her, you know.

211
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,208
It's the eyes,
I think.

212
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,333
I would like to make one
thing clear, Jason.

213
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,959
Your mother
never told me about you.

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,250
If she had, I would have
been part of your life.

215
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,542
Maybe that's not
what she wanted.

216
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,333
I think I'd like to go back
to the surface now.

217
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,834
I think it would be better

218
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,417
if you stayed on board
the<i> Enterprise</i>

219
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,500
until we have resolved
this situation with Bok.

220
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,875
What is this situation
with Bok, anyway?

221
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:11,875
I mean, why does
he want me dead?

222
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,417
Years ago, I was forced
to destroy a starship

223
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,792
commanded
by his son.

224
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:20,417
Bok apparently feels that
it would be fitting vengeance

225
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,250
to kill my son.

226
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,500
Well, I can't
hide forever.

227
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:26,750
Of course not.

228
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:29,667
We are trying
to locate Bok now.

229
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,792
I want to confront him,
settle this matter.

230
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:35,542
How long is this
going to take?

231
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,333
I assure you, there is
no one more eager

232
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,583
to put this behind us
than I am.

233
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,000
Where do I stay?

234
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,709
We'll get you
some quarters.

235
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,583
Okay, let's go.

236
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,500
Jason...

237
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,375
Your being here...

238
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:02,417
I hope it will give us

239
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,333
the chance to get
to know each other.

240
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,917
We've managed to shut down
the probe's power system,

241
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,250
so we could beam it aboard,

242
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,208
but it's not going
to be easy to figure out

243
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,291
where this thing
came from.

244
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,000
Bok took the precaution
of encrypting the probe's
navigational systems

245
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,709
so that we would be unable
to decipher its flight path.

246
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,542
We ran an analysis
of the probe's hull.

247
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,750
From the energy signatures

248
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,458
and the particle
deposits we found,

249
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,709
it looks like it traveled
through a dichromic nebula,

250
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,125
was exposed to an intensive
gravimetric distortion,

251
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,542
and passed within
one light year of
a Class-4 pulsar.

252
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,750
Those phenomena
are relatively common.

253
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,959
We would need to identify

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,542
at least one of them
specifically

255
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,333
in order to postulate
a flight path.

256
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,125
Understood.

257
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:47,458
Captain, incoming message
from Daimon Birta.

258
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,792
Put it on screen.

259
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,875
Thank you for taking the time
to talk with us, Daimon.

260
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:56,625
I understand
you have a problem.

261
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:59,083
Yes, it concerns
Daimon Bok.

262
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,041
Bok is no Daimon.

263
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,625
He was relieved of command
six years ago.

264
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,041
He was unstable,
dangerous.

265
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,083
We had to confine him
to Rog prison.

266
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,834
But he's
no longer there.

267
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,834
He was able to buy himself out
about two years ago.

268
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,083
I see.

269
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,166
Do you know
his whereabouts now?

270
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:25,041
I understand he was seen
in the Dorias Cluster

271
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,792
not too long ago.

272
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:30,208
But that cluster consists
of more than 20 star systems.

273
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,750
(<i> chuckling</i> )

274
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:37,458
You don't have
to thank me, Captain.

275
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,792
LA FORGE:
Believe it or not, Captain,

276
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,083
that might have given us
the fix we need.

277
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,667
There's a nebula
in the Dorias Cluster

278
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:43,291
that matches the same
particle signature

279
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,750
we found
on the probe.

280
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:45,959
There is a Class-4 pulsar

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,125
three light-years
from the nebula.

282
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,709
My calculations indicate
the probe was launched

283
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,125
in the Xendi Kabu system.

284
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,166
Plot a course,
take us out of orbit.

285
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,333
Jean-Luc, come in.

286
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,709
I think I need to talk
to a parent.

287
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,250
So, what's he like?

288
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,250
I'm not sure that
I can tell you.

289
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,625
He puts up so
many barriers.

290
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:34,500
I have no idea
what is underneath.

291
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,375
Keep in mind
he's had 20 years

292
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,458
to be angry that
his father wasn't there.

293
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
It's going to take some time
to get over those feelings

294
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,083
but I do think
it's possible.

295
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,250
Perhaps.

296
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,458
But surely it would be wrong
to force the issue.

297
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,083
My sense is
that he is

298
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,375
a very independent
young man.

299
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:56,709
Perhaps it would be best
if I left him alone.

300
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,125
Let him come to me
if he wants to.

301
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:04,709
Maybe you're right.

302
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,083
But I think
you should consider this.

303
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,083
Are you doing the best thing
for Jason

304
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,125
or what's easiest for you?

305
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,041
(<i> door chimes</i> )

306
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,583
Yeah.

307
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,625
Hello, Jason.

308
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:30,041
I'm Deanna Troi,
ship's counselor.

309
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,000
Come in.

310
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,250
Did Captain Picard
ask you to come talk to me?

311
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:38,083
No, I just thought I'd come
and see how you were doing.

312
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,750
A lot's happened
in the last few hours.

313
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,000
I thought you might like
to talk about it.

314
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,542
I'll be all right.

315
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,000
People have wanted
to kill me before.

316
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,542
But you've never met
your father before.

317
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,792
And I have to admit,
I never thought I would.

318
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:55,166
It must be somewhat
overwhelming.

319
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,125
I'm a
little shaky.

320
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,542
Well, that's
only natural.

321
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,834
But you know what?

322
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,542
I feel better already
just talking to you.

323
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,625
So, how did you feel
about the captain?

324
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,583
About your father?

325
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,917
He's okay.

326
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,834
A little stiff.

327
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,333
But where are you from?

328
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,917
I was born
on Betazed.

329
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:23,542
Do all the women there
have eyes like yours?

330
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,834
Look, Jason, I came here
to talk to you

331
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,917
because
I'm the ship's counselor.

332
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,625
If you don't want
to talk to me in that way

333
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,625
then I think I should go.

334
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,500
Fine.

335
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,000
You're welcome
to make an appointment

336
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,542
to come to my office.

337
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,208
Maybe I'll do just that.

338
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,625
BOK:
Picard, can you hear me?

339
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:11,000
I will kill him,
Picard,

340
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,125
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

341
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,041
Security to Captain's quarters
immediately.

342
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:26,959
Our shields were up.

343
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,667
How could he have
beamed through them?

344
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,959
I'm not sure
he did.

345
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,041
Sensors don't show
any sign of an intruder.

346
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,500
Could it have been
another hologram?

347
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:35,959
I don't think so,
Captain.

348
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,166
Something has
to generate a hologram.

349
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,667
We would have
detected it.

350
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,792
Bok once used a
mind-control device

351
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:43,458
to make me hallucinate.

352
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,000
That device emitted a very
specific energy signature.

353
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,959
I'm not reading
anything like that.

354
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,458
Could he have modified
the device

355
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,667
so he could use it
without being detected?

356
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:52,917
It's possible.

357
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,166
I'll recalibrate
the sensors

358
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,959
to scan for low-intensity
transmissions

359
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,834
and just to be sure,
I'll sweep your quarters

360
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,125
with a resonance
scanner.

361
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,125
Good.
Keep me posted.

362
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,041
Mr. Worf, I want you to assign
a security detail to Jason.

363
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,125
And what
about yourself?

364
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,375
I am not the target
of Bok's threats.

365
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,041
Jason is.

366
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,291
Captain, I have compiled
all available records

367
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,875
pertaining to Jason Vigo's
criminal record.

368
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,166
Criminal record?

369
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,959
Yes, sir.
He has been charged

370
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
three times with petty theft,
twice for disorderly conduct

371
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,041
and several dozen times
with trespassing.

372
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,375
Trespassing?

373
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:32,208
I believe the charges relate
to his climbing activities

374
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,375
in the caves beneath
the planet's surface.

375
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:39,041
This is the information
you requested, is it not?

376
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,625
Thank you,
Mr. Data.

377
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,291
What was
your name again?

378
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,709
Lieutenant Rhodes.

379
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,542
Actually... I meant
your first name.

380
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,959
Sandra.

381
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,083
Well, Sandra,

382
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:17,375
Do you think you could...
give me some room?

383
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,792
We're supposed to be
keeping an eye on you.

384
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:22,458
Can't you keep an eye on me
from over there?

385
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,792
(<i> sighs</i> )

386
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,417
PICARD:
Good morning.

387
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:41,959
I thought you said

388
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,709
your ship was the safest
place I could be.

389
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,333
Why the guards?

390
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,417
Because Bok appeared
in my quarters last night.

391
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,542
Now, it might not
have been him.

392
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,667
It may have been an image.
We're investigating.

393
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:59,000
Look, why don't you just
drop me off somewhere?

394
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,625
I can watch out
for myself.

395
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:01,792
That wouldn't be wise.

396
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,458
I've been doing it
since I was 15.

397
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,083
I'm sure you have, but Bok
is a dangerous creature.

398
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,959
He has a starship,
he has technology--

399
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,500
All right, all right.
I'll stay here.

400
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,750
You seem to like
rock climbing.

401
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,875
The holodeck can create
some very challenging climbs.

402
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,500
We could
go down together

403
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,208
and I could show you
how to use the program.

404
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,041
Thanks, but, uh, I think
I can figure it out myself.

405
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,834
Perhaps we could
climb together.

406
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,917
I'm probably not as...
skilled as you

407
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,166
but I'm not inexperienced.

408
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,834
Look...

409
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,875
I'm sorry.

410
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,000
I appreciate what
you're trying to do

411
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,917
but, Captain...

412
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,500
Captain?

413
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,667
Father? Jean-Luc?

414
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:00,709
I don't know what I'm
supposed to call you.

415
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,375
As soon as this thing
with Bok is over,

416
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:05,875
I'm leaving.

417
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,750
So, don't you see?

418
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:13,083
There really isn't any point
in our getting acquainted.

419
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,792
Let me know as soon
as you catch him, all right?

420
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,083
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47829.1.</i>

421
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,208
<i>We've been in the Xendi Kabu</i>
<i>system for over three hours</i>

422
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,375
<i>and still no sign of Bok.</i>

423
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:43,166
Captain, I am detecting
an object 5,000 kilometers

424
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,458
off our starboard bow.

425
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,542
It is
another probe.

426
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,875
Why didn't we
detect it before?

427
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,667
It must have
been cloaked, sir.

428
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:52,500
It came out
of nowhere.

429
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:54,166
On screen.

430
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,792
Is it another
holographic device?

431
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:04,625
I do not believe so.

432
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:06,667
Captain, the probe's systems
are overloading.

433
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:08,166
Red alert!
Shields up.

434
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:19,834
Damage report.

435
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,500
No damage,
sir.

436
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,667
Captain, I do not believe
it was meant as an attack

437
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:25,083
but rather
as a message.

438
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,250
A message?

439
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:29,417
Yes sir, in B'zal,
a Ferengi code

440
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,583
which uses alternating patterns

441
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,542
of light
and darkness.

442
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,333
Can you
translate it?

443
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,041
I am attempting to do so.

444
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,667
The message reads:

445
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:42,250
"My revenge
is at hand."

446
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:48,709
He's proved that he can
get to us whenever he wants.

447
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,250
Why doesn't he
do something?

448
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,166
Tea, Earl Grey, hot.

449
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,917
If you want me
to stay and talk

450
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:21,583
you better not call
for security this time.

451
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,875
How do you like your boy,
Captain?

452
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:28,750
Is he everything
you'd always hoped for?

453
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:30,834
It's a risky game
you're playing, coming here.

454
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:33,250
Next time, we'll be
ready for you.

455
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,750
Why don't we settle
this now?

456
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:38,917
Oh... and how do you
propose to do that, Picard?

457
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,041
You murdered my son!

458
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,041
It was self-defense--
he fired on my ship.

459
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,125
You were in
Ferengi space!

460
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,333
I didn't know that.

461
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:50,333
If he'd told me,
I would have withdrawn.

462
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:53,542
I'm sorry, but there's nothing
I can do to bring him back.

463
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,917
How touching.

464
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:58,125
Your apology is
worthless to me.

465
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:01,000
I demand that
you repay me for my loss.

466
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,667
You cannot put
a price on a life.

467
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:06,250
Oh, but you can,
Picard.

468
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,792
You can pay me
with your son's life.

469
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,000
No.

470
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:13,083
You don't have
any choice!

471
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:16,667
I insist on being paid.

472
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,291
That should do it.

473
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,083
Let's run a level-3
bio-scan just to be sure.

474
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,542
Rhodes to Sick Bay.

475
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,917
Medical emergency,
deck nine, section four.

476
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,333
Let's go.

477
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,208
Have you had
any other seizures

478
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,375
like this before?

479
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:59,083
No,
not really.

480
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:03,458
Sometimes my hand shakes,
but never this bad.

481
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,583
When did it first
start to happen?

482
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:08,125
About
a few months ago.

483
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:10,625
Do you have any idea
what's wrong with me?

484
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:13,709
You have a condition called
the Forrester-Trent syndrome.

485
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,083
It's a degenerative
neurological disorder--

486
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,625
very rare.

487
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,208
What do you mean,
degenerative?

488
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,625
If it goes
untreated,

489
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:24,041
it could result in
paralysis, even death.

490
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:27,291
I'm going to start you on a
neuro-stabilization regimen.

491
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,542
If we're lucky, it will
halt the degeneration

492
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:33,417
and maybe reverse
its effects.

493
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:34,834
The disease
is hereditary.

494
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:36,375
I know your father
doesn't have it.

495
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:38,375
Was your mother prone
to these seizures?

496
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:39,709
Not that I know of.

497
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,458
There have been
some cases reported

498
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,166
where the disease
was instigated

499
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:46,625
by a random mutation.

500
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:47,959
I'll run a
micro-cellular scan

501
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,625
and see if that's
what happened.

502
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,792
In the meantime,

503
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:54,291
I want you to try
to take it easy

504
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,875
and get some rest.

505
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:57,834
(scoffs)

506
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,583
Is he going
to be all right?

507
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:09,166
I wish I could say
for certain.

508
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:12,041
But I'm not sure how he'll
respond to treatments.

509
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,959
I've been thinking about what
you said the other day, and...

510
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,917
You know,
I think you were right.

511
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,333
I had convinced myself

512
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:24,083
that Jason didn't want me
to reach out to him.

513
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,333
You know, I don't think
anyone is born

514
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,458
knowing how
to be a parent.

515
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,041
You just sort of
figure it out as you go,

516
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,709
but the one quality
that tends to be

517
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,583
a requirement
for parenthood is patience.

518
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:41,333
Well, I'm not sure that
that is going to be enough.

519
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:44,792
I found out that...

520
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:46,959
Jason has
a criminal record.

521
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,458
It's nothing
very serious.

522
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,667
It's only petty theft

523
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:52,834
and so forth,
but I can't help feeling

524
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:56,000
that if I had been
part of his life

525
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:58,458
then he wouldn't be
so troubled now.

526
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,250
Maybe, but why waste time

527
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,917
blaming yourself
for not being there?

528
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:05,250
Just be here for him now.

529
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:07,709
And be patient?

530
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,583
And be patient.

531
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:19,125
We think we've found
something, Captain.

532
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,834
Bok was in direct contact
with this chair

533
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,875
for an extended period.

534
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:26,375
It is showing a
distinctive subspace
signature as a result.

535
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:29,709
We think he's
using some kind of
subspace transporter

536
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,417
to beam aboard
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

537
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:35,291
My understanding is that
such devices were impractical.

538
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:37,083
The Federation abandoned
its research in the field

539
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,834
because the technology was
found to be unreliable,

540
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,875
as well as
energy intensive.

541
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:44,041
In order to transport matter
through subspace,

542
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,959
you have to put it
in a state of quantum flux.

543
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,500
It's very unstable.

544
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:49,333
What range would that kind
of transporter have?

545
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:52,417
In theory, it could operate
over several light years.

546
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,166
That means that the probe
that exploded

547
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,542
could have been beamed
into position

548
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,041
from some point
outside sensor range.

549
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,083
If Bok uses
his transporter again,

550
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,542
we might be able to trace
the subspace signature

551
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:03,959
and locate his ship.

552
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,458
Is there any way
we can we keep Bok

553
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,667
from beaming aboard
the<i> Enterprise</i> again?

554
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,000
I don't think there is.

555
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,875
See, if he has the ability
to beam aboard

556
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:16,333
he may be able
to beam someone away.

557
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,500
It is a possibility.

558
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,834
I'm concerned that he may try
to take Jason.

559
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,834
Is there any way
we can protect him?

560
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,208
You know, we might be able

561
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,417
to keep a signal lock on him
at all times.

562
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,792
If Bok tries to beam him away,

563
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:29,750
we might be able
to hold him here.

564
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:31,291
In order to do so,

565
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,542
we would need to tie
the ship's subspace field coils

566
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,959
into the transporter system.

567
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,375
Make it so.

568
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,333
Computer, where is Jason Vigo?

569
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:47,000
Jason Vigo is
in holodeck four.

570
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,417
(<i> grunts</i> )

571
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,250
Would you wait outside?

572
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,875
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

573
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,709
Not bad.

574
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:09,041
I like climbing.

575
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,291
There's something
about

576
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:16,875
actually having your fate
in your own hands.

577
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:19,583
Yeah, I know.

578
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:22,917
It looks as though
we may have found out

579
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,375
how to locate
Bok's ship.

580
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:28,375
This could all
soon be over.

581
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,709
You came all the way up
here just to tell me that?

582
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,709
I thought it would
make you feel better.

583
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,834
Thanks.

584
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:39,125
That was nice of you.

585
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:46,166
Jason, when your mother
and I parted,

586
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:49,834
I lost track
of her completely.

587
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,709
But I would like to know more
about what happened to her,

588
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,458
if you wouldn't mind
telling me.

589
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,709
Like what?

590
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,959
Well, how did you
end up on Camor?

591
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,458
It's an unlikely place
for a woman and child.

592
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,375
Well, you know
how she was--

593
00:33:02,417 --> 00:33:04,208
See a stray cat,
take it in.

594
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,458
See somebody cold,
give them your coat.

595
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:10,458
Yes, that was Miranda,
all right.

596
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,083
She'd heard about
all the children

597
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,667
that had been
orphaned on Camor

598
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:16,250
from the Cardassian war.

599
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:18,625
Oh... I see.

600
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:22,041
I was only ten
when we went there.

601
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,291
I remember her
telling me

602
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,417
all about the
boys and girls

603
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,667
that didn't have anyone
to care for them.

604
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:35,834
So she got this big house,
practically falling apart

605
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:38,750
then she started
rounding up children.

606
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:40,959
Eventually, there were
over 40 of us there.

607
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:45,250
She called it a school.

608
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:51,208
You know, she got up
before dawn every day

609
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,625
and went to bed
well after midnight.

610
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:58,000
In between, she never
stopped working.

611
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:05,208
She taught us all
how to read.

612
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:10,250
And she grew vegetables
in hardpan to feed us.

613
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:14,083
And she made sure
we knew how to sing.

614
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:16,667
It's important in
a place like Camor.

615
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:24,375
And then one day,
she was attacked

616
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:27,917
by two men in the street
in broad daylight

617
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:30,750
for the food
she was carrying.

618
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:32,959
And if she'd just
given it to them,

619
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,917
they probably
wouldn't have hurt her.

620
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:39,875
But she knew how important
the food was to us.

621
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,166
So they killed her.

622
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:48,166
I'm so sorry.

623
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:51,834
Don't be sorry for me.

624
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,709
My mother made sure

625
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,000
that we were all
tough enough to make it.

626
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:03,166
Jason, isn't there some way
that I can be a father to you?

627
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,792
My own father and I
were estranged.

628
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:07,458
He wanted me
to stay at home

629
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,667
and tend the vineyards,

630
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:10,959
and I wanted
to join Starfleet.

631
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:18,959
And he died before we could
come to terms with that,

632
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,834
and I've regretted that
all of my life.

633
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:28,083
I don't want the same thing
to happen to you and me.

634
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,375
You don't understand.

635
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:32,583
I'm not anybody
you'd want for a son.

636
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,333
Trust me,
if you knew...

637
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,875
if you knew
anything about me,

638
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:38,959
you wouldn't,
you wouldn't be trying so hard.

639
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,709
You're so wrong.
Oh, really?

640
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,041
Let me spell it out
for you.

641
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:46,542
I've been in trouble
since I was a teenager.

642
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:47,959
I lie.

643
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:50,333
I steal.

644
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,166
I use people.

645
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,083
I'm
a criminal.

646
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,417
That's what
your son is.

647
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,625
I know.

648
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,375
You do?
Oh, yes.

649
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:05,917
I know all about your troubles
with the Camor authorities.

650
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,041
You do?

651
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,709
It doesn't make
any difference, Jason.

652
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,125
You're still my son.

653
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:16,875
And like it or not,
I'm your father.

654
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:22,333
I don't know
what that means.

655
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:25,375
I know it means
something.

656
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,625
There's some
connection.

657
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,166
Yeah.

658
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,625
But one thing
is clear--

659
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:37,959
You'll never look at your
hairline again in the same way.

660
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,458
You wanted
to see me?

661
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,709
Yes.

662
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,250
It's about Jason.

663
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:09,333
I finished the micro-cellular
scan I was running.

664
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:12,291
There's something
you need to know.

665
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,959
Sir, sensors
are detecting

666
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,500
a subspace carrier wave
headed for the ship.

667
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:19,667
Its signature is consistent
with Bok's transporter.

668
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:22,291
See if you can trace it
and locate Bok's ship.

669
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,333
Geordi, are you ready
down there?

670
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,333
I've got
a signal lock on Jason.

671
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,875
Riker to Picard.

672
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:29,208
Picard here.

673
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,917
Bok is trying
to use his transporter.

674
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:43,417
The transporter beam is focusing
on deck nine, section four.

675
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:44,583
Jason's quarters.

676
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,083
LA FORGE:
I'm on it, Commander.

677
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,542
RHODES:
Security to Bridge.

678
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:51,041
Bok is beaming Jason
off the ship.

679
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,583
Initiating
transport now.

680
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,709
I'm losing his signal.

681
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:08,959
Bok is reestablishing
his lock on him.

682
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,458
Have you been able
to locate Bok's ship?

683
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,875
No, sir.

684
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:26,500
The subspace signature
left by his transporter

685
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:28,291
is decaying more
rapidly than predicted.

686
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,583
It may not be
possible to trace it.

687
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:33,500
WORF:
Captain, another probe
has materialized

688
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:36,000
500 kilometers
to starboard.

689
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:37,875
It is sending
a transmission.

690
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:40,542
Put it on screen.

691
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:44,208
This is
a very special day, Picard.

692
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,917
15 years ago you took
my son away from me.

693
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:52,500
Today, I will take your son
away from you.

694
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:55,500
It will be our anniversary.

695
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:02,000
I wanted you to see
him one last time.

696
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:07,208
DATA:
I am tracing
the transporter beam

697
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,750
Bok used to send the probe.

698
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:10,333
The ship
is holding position

699
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:13,750
approximately 300 billion
kilometers from here.

700
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,834
Plot a course.
Maximum warp.

701
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:19,417
Even at warp nine,
we wouldn't get there

702
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,917
for another
20 minutes.

703
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,542
The modifications you made
to the transporter--

704
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,291
Is there any way
we could use

705
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:27,125
a subspace transport
from here

706
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:29,291
to get me
onto Bok's ship?

707
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,208
It may be possible, sir,
but it would not be advisable.

708
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,208
I'll take that as a yes.
You're with me.

709
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,583
There.

710
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:48,458
I've aligned
the field coils.

711
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,709
Phase dampers
are in sync.

712
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:54,208
Standing by to modulate
the transport pattern.

713
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,542
Captain, we might be able
to get you over there

714
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,500
but I don't see how
we're going to get you back.

715
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:00,750
We'll deal with that
when the time comes.

716
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:03,750
Transport's going to take
longer than normal.

717
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:05,166
We'll have to shunt
your pattern

718
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:07,542
through the subspace
field coils.
Understood.

719
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:10,125
Initiating transport
sequence now.

720
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,083
Maybe we can
make a deal.

721
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,917
What kind of deal?

722
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,041
Tell my father
you killed me.

723
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,166
Put a phaser burn
on my shirt

724
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:22,583
and send it to him.

725
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:24,959
He'll think
I'm dead.

726
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,125
That's what this
is about, isn't it?

727
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:30,041
I got friends
on Camor V

728
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,417
that will make it
worth your while.

729
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,750
I understand your
desire to live,

730
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,834
but I want Picard
to see your body

731
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,750
so there will
be no doubt.

732
00:40:40,709 --> 00:40:43,250
Lower your weapons
or Bok is dead.

733
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,375
Lower yours,
or your son dies!

734
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:52,083
You know as well as I do, Bok,
he's not my son.

735
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,041
I know
what you've done.

736
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,583
Miranda Vigo
is his mother,

737
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,709
but I am not
his father.

738
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,250
You made it appear so because
you re-sequenced his DNA,

739
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:04,375
but your technique
was flawed.

740
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:07,375
He developed
a neurological disorder.

741
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:10,417
When my ship's doctor
investigated it,

742
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:13,083
she discovered
what you had done.

743
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,291
Now he'll never
pay the ransom.

744
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:16,500
Shut up!

745
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:18,000
There never was
a ransom.

746
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:20,000
All he was ever interested in
was vengeance.

747
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:23,792
Daimon, is this true?

748
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:25,583
He's not
a daimon!

749
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,375
He was stripped
of command.

750
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:30,083
They had no right
to do that to me.

751
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:33,625
He lied to you, so that you
would help him in his plan.

752
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:36,500
The<i> Enterprise</i> is closing in
on your position.

753
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:39,500
If you let the two of us go,
they won't attack you.

754
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:42,083
They won't attack us
with you on board.

755
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,750
They will cripple your ship
and keep you here

756
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:48,542
until the Ferengi
authorities arrive.

757
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:51,166
You've got
a lot of explaining to do.

758
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,208
Your only hope
is to turn Bok over to them

759
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,625
and tell them
that he deceived you.

760
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:08,041
There is no profit
in this for us.

761
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:18,625
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47831.8.</i>

762
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:20,250
<i>At Jason's request</i>

763
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:23,709
<i>the</i> Enterprise<i> has returned</i>
<i>to Camor V.</i>

764
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,959
Dr. Crusher feels

765
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,667
I'm responding well
to the treatment.

766
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:31,208
She thinks that the damage
may be completely reversed.

767
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,667
I'm glad to hear it.
Yeah.

768
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:35,041
Are you sure that you
wouldn't like to stay

769
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:36,667
on board the<i> Enterprise</i> 
for a few more days?

770
00:42:36,709 --> 00:42:38,166
Uh, I can't.

771
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:40,959
I have a life
back on Camor.

772
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It's a mess, but I'd
like to go back

773
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,500
and straighten
things out.

774
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:45,875
I understand.

775
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:55,875
Well, uh, maybe next time
you come back this way

776
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:57,542
you can look me up.

777
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:58,917
I will.

778
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:01,125
I, uh, put
a little something

779
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:03,834
into your bag while
you were packing.

780
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:14,500
I know you would
probably have preferred

781
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:15,834
a bottle
of Saurian brandy

782
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:19,083
but, uh, that's all
I could come up with.

783
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:21,166
I-I can't
accept this.

784
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,875
I want you to have it.

785
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:46,458
Energize.
