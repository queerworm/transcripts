Captain, Starfleet Academy
is requesting an update

10
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:26,208
on our estimated arrival.

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,667
Mr. Data?

12
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:28,792
We should be arriving
at Earth

13
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,500
in ten hours,
16 minutes, sir.

14
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:33,125
Please inform the academy,
Mr. Worf.

15
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,291
And send my regards
to Superintendent Brand.

16
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,500
Aye, sir.

17
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:37,834
TROI:
Do you know
Admiral Brand?

18
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,709
We've met a few times.

19
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,709
She's a formidable woman.

20
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,542
Sounds like
my superintendent.

21
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,333
When I was at the academy,
we had a Vulcan superintendent

22
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:49,166
who had memorized
the personnel files
of every single cadet.

23
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,709
Knew everything about them.

24
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,667
It was like having your
parents around all the time.

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,375
My superintendent
was a Betazoid--

26
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:57,750
a full telepath.

27
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,083
When he sent for you
to his office

28
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,125
he didn't have
to ask what you'd done.

29
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,208
<i>You</i> got called
to the superintendent's office?

30
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,166
That's a story
I'd like to hear.

00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:10,041
Sir? We are being hailed
again by the academy.

33
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,542
It is Admiral Brand.

34
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,041
On screen.

35
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,834
Sir, she is requesting
a private channel.

00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,333

Admiral Brand,
what can I do for you?

39
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:32,583
Hello, Captain.

40
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,417
I know you're a close friend
of the Crusher family.

41
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,917
Yes.

42
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,667
I wanted to inform you
personally.

43
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,875
There's been an accident.

44
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,000
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

45

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,792
PICARD:
He had second-degree
burns on the chest

52
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,417
and multiple fractures
of his right arm

53
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,500
but he's going to be fine.

54
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,542
Have they completed
the regeneration series?

55
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,291
I'm not certain.

56
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,792
Wesley's allergic
to metorapan treatments.

57
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:55,166
I think they'll have to use
a bicaridine substitute.

58
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,083
Beverly...
I should send
his complete records

59
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,041
to the academy infirmary.

60
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,625
Of course,
they probably already have them

61
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:01,834
but you can't be too sure.

62
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,667
Beverly... he's fine.

63
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:09,709
I know he's fine.
I know he's fine.

64
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,083
How did it happen?

65
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,291
Apparently,
his squadron was practicing

66
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:19,125
on the academy flight range
near Saturn.

67
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:22,166
They were flying
a close formation.

68
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,500
There was a collision.

69
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,583
All five ships
were destroyed.

70
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,834
Four of the cadets were able
to transport out.

71
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,291
One didn't make it.

72
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,458
Do you know who it was?

73
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,417
Yes, his name was Joshua Albert.

74
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,625
Wesley spoke of him.

75
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,917
They were friends.

76
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,291
Wesley was so excited
to make the flight team.

77
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,875
Of course,
I was a little nervous

78
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:48,583
but I was proud.

79
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,834
I always knew there was a chance

80
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,125
that something
like this might...

81
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,166
Beverly?

82
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,458
Wesley is alive, and he's well.

83
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,792
There was very little to salvage
from the wreckage.

84
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:16,750
We did recover one of
the ship's data recorders

85
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,792
but it was badly damaged.

86
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,875
We are attempting
to restore the information

87
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:23,375
but that will take
some time.

88
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,542
Standard procedure calls
for an immediate investigation

89
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,542
by two command-level officers.

90
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,750
Captain Satelk and I

91
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:34,083
will be taking depositions

92
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,959
from Nova Squadron
at 1500 hours today.

93
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,458
Commander Albert...

94
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,166
I'm sure that everyone
in this room joins me

95
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,959
in expressing
my deepest sympathies to you

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,083
on the tragic loss of your son.

97
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:58,542
There will be a memorial service
for Cadet Albert

98
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,583
this evening
in the west garden.

99
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:03,208
It has been suggested

100
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,166
that we should cancel
the graduation ceremonies

101
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,291
in the light of what's happened.

102
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,667
Commander Albert and I
have discussed this

103
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,375
and we've agreed
that commencement

104
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:13,709
should go forward as planned.

105
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,959
The cadets should know

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,208
that even after
a tragedy like this

107
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,375
there are still duties
to perform...

108
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,792
and life continues.

109
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,667
Thank you all
for coming.

110
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,959
It's good
to see you again, Captain.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,041
I wish it were
under better circumstances.

112
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,291
This is an unhappy way
to begin commencement.

113
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,250
If you require
any assistance

114
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,500
then the<i> Enterprise</i>
is at your disposal.

115
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:55,500
I'm sure we'll be able
to conduct the investigation,

116
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:58,000

for your offer.

(<i> sighs</i> )

121
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,959

How are you feeling,
Wesley?

123
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,375
Not bad.

124
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:26,625
The arm's a little sore.

125
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,375
We were very sorry
to hear about Joshua.

126
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:38,625
Would you like
to talk about it?

127
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,542
No. I don't think so.

128
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,000
No, thank you.

129
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,959
I know you're just trying
to be helpful, sir

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,333
but it seems like
that's all I've talked about

131
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,709
for the last two days.

132
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,000
And I don't want
to go through it again.

133
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,542
I understand. I just
want you to know

134
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,166
that I'm available if you
should change your mind.

135
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,041

Mr. Locarno.

148

I came by to see if Wes

And how are you

150

Oh, I'm okay.

151
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:30,959
I just never lost anyone
under my command before.

152
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,458
I'm afraid that
never gets easier.

00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,000
will you excuse
us, please?

155

Nick and I have some things

156
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,208
Of course.

00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,375
Let me give you
a hand.

182
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,834
You?

183
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,542
I've acquired an interest
over the years.

184
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,750
Well...

185
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:30,750
don't plant them
too deep.

186
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:31,834
The stems will...

187
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,500
Will rot.

188
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,709
<i>Captain</i> Picard.

189
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,250
Of the<i> Enterprise,</i> no less.

190
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,375
And giving the
commencement address.

191
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:44,709
You sound surprised.

192
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,875
Surprised?

193
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:47,291
Uh-uh.

194
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,959
Nothing you ever did
surprised me, son.

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,333
Except that time

196
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,500
you caught that Ligonian
with a reverse body lift

197
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,250
and pinned him
in the first

198
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,792
14 seconds of the match.

199
00:10:58,834 --> 00:10:59,834
Didn't think you
had it in you.

200
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,166
Well, it was
all in the legs.

201
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,083
All that running I did.

202
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,834
(<i> chuckles</i> )

203
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,792
Boothby...

204
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,750
Hmm?

205
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:15,250
I don't think that I ever...

206
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:19,291
I don't think
I ever told you...

207
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,291
how much I appreciate...

208
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,500
Mm-mm. There's
nothing to tell.

209
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,500
Yes, there is.

210
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:30,959
I... I just wanted to...

211
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,375
while I was here...

212
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:34,750
Look, you know
as well as I do

213
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,333
I would never have
graduated, if you...

214
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,291
You made a mistake.

215
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,750
There isn't
a man among us

216
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:42,208
who hasn't been young
enough to make one.

217
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,208
Nevertheless...

218
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,500
You did what you had to do.

219
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:46,542
You did what you
thought was best.

220
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,250
I just made sure that you
listened to yourself.

221
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,333
At the time, I thought

222
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:57,166
you were a mean-spirited,
vicious old man.

223
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,917
I was.

224
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,583
And by the way

225
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,834
I was about the same
age you are now.

226
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,375
I didn't speak
to you for months.

227
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,834
You needed to get
your bearings.

228
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,125
I knew that.

229
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,125
The important thing is

230
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,709
what you did with
your life afterwards.

231
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,417
It seems you did okay.

232
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,834
That's thanks enough for me.

233
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,542
Did you know the boy

234
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,959
from Nova Squadron
who was killed?

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,333
Josh Albert?

236
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,375
Yeah.

237
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,709
Crusher, Hajar,

238
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,500
Sito, Locarno--

239
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,667
I know them all.

240
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,458
(<i> sighs</i> )

241
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,667
You nervous?

242
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,041
No.

243
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,667
Yes.

244
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,333
That's okay.
So am I.

245
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,375
But we're going
to be all right.

246
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:03,959
We've got some
tough times ahead

247
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,750
but we've always come through
for each other.

248
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,667
Whatever happens,
I want you all to know

249
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:10,500
that leading this team
has been the high point

250
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:13,083
of my years
at the academy.

251
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,375
No one could have asked
for a better team.

252
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:19,625
Or better friends.

253
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,667
Let's go.

254
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,417
LOCARNO:
At this point, we accelerated

255
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,875
and executed a starboard turn
of 27 degrees.

256
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,500
We came out of the turn
on course for Titan.

257
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,750
And you were still
in the lead position?

258
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:37,792
Yes, sir.

259
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:39,125
Continue.

260
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,333
As we entered Titan's
gravitational sphere

261
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,166
I gave the signal
to tighten up and move into

262
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,959
a diamond slot
formation.

263
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,375
Remaining in
the diamond formation

264
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:49,333
we executed a low-apogee
turn around Titan

265
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,208
and began a z-plus
25 degree climb

266
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,875
in preparation
for a Yeager Loop.

267
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,166
Approximately nine seconds later

268
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,000
Cadet Albert's ship collided
with Cadet Hajar's.

269
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,542
We had less
than two seconds

270
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,333
to activate
our emergency transporters

271
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,542
and beam to the EVAC stations
at Mimas.

272
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,291
Everyone made it
except Josh.

273
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,458
Thank you, Mr. Locarno.

274
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:25,250
BRAND:
Cadet Hajar.

275
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,917
As team navigator

276
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:31,291
you filed a flight plan
with the academy range officer

277
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,333
before the exercise, correct?

278
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,083
Yes, sir.

279
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,375
Did Nova Squadron

280
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,709
deviate from that
flight plan

281
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,041
after you entered
the Saturn range?

282
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,709
No, sir.

283
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,917
And how do you explain the fact

284
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,834
that the low-apogee turn
around Titan

285
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,834
was at least 2,000 kilometers
closer to the moon

286
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,291
than indicated in your plan?

287
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,041
We were still within
flight safety parameters, sir.

288
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,875
That was not my question, Cadet.

289
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,000
(<i> clears throat</i> )

290
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,041
We had discussed
changing our approach

291
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,125
after I filed the flight plan.

292
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,500
The final decision was made
en route to Saturn.

293
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:14,333
I didn't consider it
significant enough
to mention here.

294
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,125
I apologize
for the confusion, sir.

295
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,125
I should have been more precise.

296
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,250
(<i> audience murmuring</i> )

297
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,625
Did you see Mr. Albert's
ship break formation

298
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:27,041
before it collided
with your ship?

299
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,000
No, sir.

300
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,375
My first indications of trouble

301
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:33,083
were when my proximity alarm
went off.

302
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,834
You may be seated.

303
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,250
Did any of you see the
collision take place?

304
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:41,083
No, sir.

305
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,500
Cadet Sito...

306
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,041
you were in
the tail position.

307
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,959
Therefore you should have seen
any sign of trouble

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,041
from Cadet Albert.

309
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,625
And you saw nothing?

310
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:55,625
That is correct, sir.

311
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,291
Did your attention falter?

312
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,375
No, sir.

313
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,166
I was flying solely
on sensor readings at the time.

314
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,458
I did not have any visual
contact with Cadet Albert's ship

315
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,083
when he broke formation.

316
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,000
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Sensor readings?

317
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,083
(<i> agitated murmuring</i> )

318
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,792
What's wrong?

319
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:17,542
Well, it's unusual to
fly on sensors alone

320
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,208
during this type
of maneuver.

321
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,083
A pilot relies on visual
clues from the other ships

322
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,750
to maintain formation.

323
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,583
(<i> rings bell</i> )

324
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,333
(<i> whispering stops</i> )

325
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,291
If you were flying
on sensors alone

326
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:34,041
perhaps you could tell us
the orientation of his ship

327
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,542
before the collision.

328
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't know, sir.

329
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,208
You were flying a ship

330
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,959
traveling 80,000 kph

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,709
with Cadet Albert's ship
less than ten meters away

332
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,291
and you don't know
what his orientation was?

333
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,083
I don't remember, sir.

334
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,709
Sir, may I?

335
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,583
BRAND:
Go ahead.

336
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,250
Admiral...

337
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

338
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,208
Josh was a good pilot

339
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,542
but lately he'd been
having difficulties.

340
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,959
He'd get nervous
during close flybys

341
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,583
and pull away in
the final seconds.

342
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,041
His formation flying
was a little erratic.

343
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,458
And you didn't report this
to anyone?

344
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,875
No, sir, I didn't.

345
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:22,375
We'd flown together a long time.

346
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,333
I thought he could handle it
if I gave him a chance.

347
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,208
I was wrong.

348
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,875
BRAND:
Then you are saying
that the accident

349
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,959
was Cadet Albert's fault.

350
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:40,333
I think Josh got frightened

351
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,875
and tried to pull out
of the turn prematurely

352
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:46,667
and then crashed
into Cadet Hajar.

353
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,041
Josh was our friend.

354
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,250
We didn't want him
to be remembered

355
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,667
as someone who panicked.

356
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,417
Please be seated.

357
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,208
I am very disturbed

358
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,792
by what I have
heard here today.

359
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,500
By your own admission

360
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:12,000
you allowed
your teammate to fly

361
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,834
when you knew
he was having difficulties

362
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,208
maintaining formation.

363
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,417
That demonstrates

364
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,375
a serious lack
of judgment.

365
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:22,417
I am also disturbed
by the fact

366
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,959
that you did not come forward

367
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,458
with this information
immediately.

368
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,041
We should have
the first data

369
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,000
from Mr. Crusher's
flight recorder tonight.

370
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,542
We will reconvene
at 1300 hours tomorrow.

371
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,792
Everything's fine.

372
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,000
Trust me.

373
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,458
LA FORGE:
I don't know, Captain.

374
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,917
The academy has
one of the best

375
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:04,291
reconstructive analysis
labs in Starfleet.

376
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,542
I'm not sure there's
much we could contribute

377
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,834
to the investigation.

378
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,250
Yes, that may well be...

379
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,583
but Wesley's one of our own.

380
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,917
Understood, sir.
We'll get right on it.

381
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,834
Good. I've spoken
with Admiral Brand,
and she's agreed

382
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,041
to allow us access to all

383
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,750
of the physical evidence
and testimony.

384
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:25,250
Thank you, gentlemen.

385
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,792
You shouldn't
have said it, Nick.

386
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,750
Josh wasn't responsible
for what happened.

387
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:32,375
I had to do something.

388
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:34,333
You said that we weren't
going to have to lie to them.

389
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,458
We all agreed not
to lie to them.

390
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,458
I didn't lie.

391
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,834
Everything I said
was the truth.

392
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,041
The accident was
not Josh's fault.

393
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,792
Look, he was
my friend, too, Wes.

394
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:48,333
I worked to get him
on this team

395
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,667
but the truth is, he panicked.

396
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:51,250
We don't know that.

397
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,834
Of course, we do.

398
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,250
None of us has wanted
to say it out loud

399
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,542
but we've all had
the same thought.

400
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,875
Haven't we?

401
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:07,291
He must have pulled away
too soon.

402
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,959
I think he got scared.

403
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,208
Sito?

404
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,166
Wes, I know you want
to protect his memory--

405
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,417
we all do--

406
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,917
but we have to look out
for ourselves now.

407
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,417
What do you want us to do?

408
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,291
Walk in there and tell them
everything that happened?

409
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,208
We might as well
turn in our uniforms

410
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,625
and start packing our bags.

411
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,250
Are we ready
for that?

412
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,583
We'll take this
one step at a time.

413
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,250
This is the preliminary report
from your flight recorder.

414
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,792
It was damaged so
badly in the crash

415
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,500
that the lab could
only retrieve

416
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:50,542
a third of the
total telemetry
from the recorder.

417
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,041
And all of it
is before the collision.

418
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,041
There's no problem here.

419
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:01,667
I don't know
if I can do this, Nick.

420
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:04,959
SITO:
You don't have to lie.

421
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,500
Just don't volunteer
any new information.

422
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:16,542
The first night
I met you, Wes

423
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,792
I knew I wanted you
on this squad.

424
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:20,583
You, more than any of the rest
would understand

425
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,500
what it means
to be able to count on someone

426
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:25,166
'cause you've
been out there,

427
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,000
putting yourself
on the line.

428
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,542
You know you've got to be
able to count

429
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,333
on the people on your team

430
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:35,000
because your life
is in their hands

431
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,208
and their lives
are in yours.

432
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,333
We made a promise
to each other,

433
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,291
right in the beginning

434
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,000
that we'd
stick together.

435
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,291
We were Nova Squadron.

436
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,625
Nobody else
could say that.

437
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,208
And even after
we graduated

438
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,333
we'd try to get posted
on the same duty.

439
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,375
We were going to be a team
for a long time.

440
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,709
Josh can't be a part
of those plans anymore

441
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,333
but I think he would still
want us to be a team.

442
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,250
What do you think?

443
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,291
Mr. Crusher.

444
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,750
Sir.

445
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:31,125
At ease.

446
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:35,834
Am I interrupting?

447
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,709
No. I was just
going over

448
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,792
my deposition
for tomorrow.

449
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:42,750
They told me
you'd be here.

450
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:45,333
I found this
in Josh's room.

451
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,375
I think it belongs to you.

452
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:51,083
Our ski trip.

453
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,375
Josh and I went
to Calgary last month.

454
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,625
He forgot his sweater,
so he borrowed one of mine.

455
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,500
He told me you helped
him with his classes.

456
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,458
A little.

457
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,750
He only needed help
in statistical mechanics.

458
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,834
If Josh had a weakness,
it was mathematics.

459
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,792
No, he could do it.

460
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:15,000
He just didn't like to.

461
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,125
His mother and I thought

462
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:19,458
he'd never get
out of calculus.

463
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,041
Then he found out
what the academy

464
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:24,041
entrance requirements
were like and...

465
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,792
that turned him around.

466
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:30,625
He stayed after class

467
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:33,625
got a tutor.

468
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:36,166
He really worked hard.

469
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,750
He never gave up
on anything.

470
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:45,000
And he had a lot
of respect for you

471
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:47,458
and everybody
on the team.

472
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:52,083
I realize it
was his fault...

473
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:57,250
and everybody could
have been killed.

474
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:03,083
And I want to
say that, uh...

475
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:08,375
I want to say I'm sorry.

476
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:11,208
I'm sorry that
he let you down.

477
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:34,166
BRAND:
Are you ready,
Mr. Crusher?

478
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,542
Yes, sir.

479
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,291
This is the beginning
of our run toward Titan.

480
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,792
I'm on the right wing.

481
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:46,917
Where is Mr. Albert
at this point?

482
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,709
He was on my port quarter

483
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,000
approximately
50 meters away.

484
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,208
We've just received the signal

485
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,834
to begin
the diamond slot formation.

486
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:58,542
That's Cadet Locarno
coming into view now.

487
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,083
We're in a
20-degree turn

488
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,667
around Titan.

489
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:07,959
We should be coming out of
Titan's gravity well about now.

490
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,458
LOCARNO (<i> over com</i> ):
Okay, people, follow me in.

491
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:13,709
BRAND:
That is the extent
of the data

492
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,917
we were able to recover
from the flight recorder.

493
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:18,667
Mr. Crusher,

494
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:20,250
would you describe
what happened

495
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:22,750
after you left
orbit of Titan?

496
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:28,125
Once we cleared the moon

497
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:30,250
Mr. Locarno led us
into a Yeager Loop.

498
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:32,208
Approximately
nine seconds later

499
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,375
my proximity
alarm went off.

500
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:38,041
I tried to veer away, but it
was too late, and I was hit.

501
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:40,583
I lost control of my ship.

502
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:43,000
A power coupling
exploded in
my cockpit.

503
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,458
I don't know how

504
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,375
but I managed to activate
my escape transporter.

505
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:51,250
And the next thing I remember
is finding myself

506
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,959
on the emergency
EVAC station on Mimas

507
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,166
with the rest of the squadron--

508
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:59,125
except Josh.

509
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:04,458
Do you have anything
to add to your testimony?

510
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,792
No, sir.

511
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:12,458
Mr. Crusher, will you describe
a Yeager Loop.

512
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:18,333
The ships begin
in a diamond slot formation

513
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:21,417
and climb and loop backwards
at a steep angle

514
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:23,333
and at the peak of the loop

515
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:26,750
turn over and accelerate
in a new direction.

516
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:29,917
Mr. Crusher, did your team
remain in formation

517
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,458
throughout the loop?

518
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:33,959
Yes, sir.

519
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,375
I want you to be
absolutely clear

520
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:38,250
on this point, Mr. Crusher.

521
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:41,625
Before the collision,
was Nova Squadron

522
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,917
in a diamond slot formation?

523
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,583
Yes, sir.

524
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,041
Computer, display
Saturn NAVCON file

525
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,959
6-379.

526
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,542
These images
were obtained

527
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,709
from a navigational
control satellite

528
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,458
in orbit around Saturn
during a standard sensor sweep.

529
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,750
Computer, freeze image.

530
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,583
Magnify sector
Gamma Three

531
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,125
and enhance.

532
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,375
This image
was recorded

533
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:18,875
when your ships moved briefly

534
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,792
into the satellite's
sensor range.

535
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:22,959
According to
the time index,
what you see

536
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,333
on the monitor
took place seven seconds

537
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:29,417
after Nova Squadron<i> completed</i>
the Yeager Loop.

538
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:36,291
Mr. Crusher,
are these ships

539
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:38,250
in a diamond slot formation?

540
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,291
No, sir.

541
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:45,834
What is your explanation,
Mr. Crusher?

542
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:53,875
I have none, sir.

543
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,709
Everything's going
to be okay, Wesley.

544
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,917
There must be
an explanation
for all of this.

545
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,250
Data and Geordi are
already analyzing

546
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:10,500
the flight recorder and
the satellite transmission.

547
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:12,208
Why?

548
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,000
Well, there must be something
wrong with the satellite data.

549
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,083
It might have been
tampered with.

550
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,542
Mom...

551
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:20,333
Well, there must be
some explanation for this.

552
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,000
I know you're telling the truth

553
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,625
but the satellite data made it
look as if you were lying.

554
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:28,709
I've spoken with
the other parents.

555
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,291
I am going to talk
to Admiral Brand

556
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,875
and ask her to
delay the inquiry...

557
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,333
Mom.

558
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,333
Don't.

559
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:38,792
You can't do that.

560
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:39,875
I'm not going
to let them

561
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,291
ruin your career, Wesley.

562
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,875
You haven't done
anything wrong.

563
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,667
Mom...

564
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:49,041
don't try to protect me.

565
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:54,000
Please stay out of this.

566
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,458
Ah...

567
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,667
the weeds
keep popping up

568
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:11,000
in the pittosporum.

569
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,834
Poor plants don't have
a chance to grow.

570
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,291
You could use
a good herbicide

571
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,333
instead of pulling the weeds
with your bare hands.

572
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,125
Mm-hmm, and you could
explore space

573
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:24,208
on a holodeck instead
of a starship.

574
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,083
Boothby, tell me some more
about Nova Squadron.

575
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,500
Not going well, is it?

576
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:34,000
No, it isn't.

577
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:39,166
You remember the parrises
squares tournament of '24?

578
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,542
The final game against Minsk...

579
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:46,083
It took me three weeks
to repair the grounds

580
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,250
after the celebration.

581
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,875
We had a lot to celebrate.

582
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:51,917
Our team
wasn't supposed to win.

583
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,417
We were very proud of them.

584
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,166
Well, the cadets today

585
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,458
are just as proud
of the Nova Squadron.

586
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,375
The celebration they held
after Nova won the Rigel Cup

587
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:03,667
made '24 look
like a dinner party.

588
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:04,875
To the other cadets

589
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:07,083
the members of
that team are gods

590
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:09,667
and that's a hard image
to live up to.

591
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:12,333
But Nick Locarno--
he watches out for them.

592
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,917
He keeps them together.

593
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:17,458
Nick is what makes
that team special.

594
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,583
He's their coach,
surrogate father

595
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,542
and best friend, all in one.

596
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,041
A natural leader.

597
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,208
The members of that team
love him.

598
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,333
If he asks them
to do something, they do it

599
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:32,125
even if it means
going right over a cliff.

600
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,875
Report.

601
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,583
Nothing conclusive.

602
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,375
We do know that
the collision occurred
about four seconds

603
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,667
after the satellite
images were recorded.

604
00:30:58,709 --> 00:31:00,166
But we still don't know
how the ships got

605
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,792
into the new formation
or why the crash occurred.

606
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:04,041
We unsuccessfully tried

607
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,583
53 different
computational models

608
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,125
in an effort to simulate
the movements

609
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,208
of the Nova Squadron
just prior to the crash.

610
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,750
There are just too
many variables to take

611
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:15,083
into consideration--
speed, attitude, course...

612
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:17,041
Did Wesley's flight
recorder indicate

613
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,500
that there was
anything unusual

614
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:20,750
about the ship, or the
way it was operating?

615
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:23,208
Well, the starboard power
flow was fluctuating.

616
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,125
However, it was well
within operational limits.

617
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,375
LA FORGE:
Fluidic pressure in
the landing struts was low,

618
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:31,458
but I don't know
what difference that would make.

619
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,750
We did find that Wesley opened
his coolant interlock

620
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,041
just before beginning
the maneuver around Titan.

621
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,542
That is a bit unusual.

622
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,291
Normally, the interlock
is closed

623
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,875
unless you're performing a check
on the engine coolant levels.

624
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:45,083
But there's no evidence
that Wesley was performing

625
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,959
that sort
of a check.

626
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,041
Filling the primary
coolant tanks

627
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,625
requires an open interlock

628
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:51,875
but that can only be performed
at a maintenance bay.

629
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:54,750
Is there any other reason
for opening the valve?

630
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:57,542
Well, it's the first step
in purging the plasma exhaust.

631
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,834
That procedure would be
extremely hazardous

632
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,375
while the ship was in flight.

633
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,917
Yeah, the engine would probably
ignite the plasma.

634
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,959
Ignite the plasma...

635
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:12,083
That's exactly
what they were trying to do.

636
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:23,000
(<i> door chimes</i> )

637
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,375
Come.

638
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:29,834
Captain.

639
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,250
Can you tell me
what this maneuver is?

640
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:45,667
It's a Kolvoord Starburst, sir.

641
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:51,333
Five ships crossing
within ten meters of each other

642
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:54,500
and igniting
their plasma trails.

643
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:56,709
It's one of the most spectacular

644
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,625
and difficult
demonstrations in
precision flying.

645
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:04,208
And it hasn't been performed at
the academy for over 100 years.

646
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,542
Do you know why?

647
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,250
It was banned by the academy

648
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,959
following
a training accident, sir.

649
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,125
An accident in which all
five cadets lost their lives.

650
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:28,709
I think that Nicholas Locarno

651
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,709
wanted to end his academy career
in a blaze of glory

652
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,083
and that he convinced
the four of you to learn

653
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,208
the Kolvoord Starburst

654
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,375
for the commencement
demonstration.

655
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:43,250
If it worked, it would thrill
the assembled guests

656
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,333
and Locarno would graduate

657
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:48,041
as a living legend.

658
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,917
Only it didn't work.

659
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:55,458
And Joshua Albert
paid the price.

660
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,834
Am I correct?

661
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:01,750
Cadet, I asked you
a question.

662
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:04,250
Am I correct?

663
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:06,959
I choose not to answer, sir.

664
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:11,083
You choose not to answer?

665
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,458
But you've already given
an answer to the inquiry.

666
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,959
That answer was a lie.

667
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,291
I said the accident occurred
after the loop.

668
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,959
It did.

669
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,375
What you neglected to mention
was that following the loop

670
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:31,917
your team attempted a maneuver

671
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:35,959
that was the direct
cause of the crash.

672
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,625
Oh, you told the
truth, up to a point.

673
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:43,542
But a lie of omission
is still a lie.

674
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,625
Do you remember the first day
you came aboard this ship?

675
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,333
Your mother brought
you on the bridge.

676
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,375
Yes, sir.

677
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:00,917
You even sat in my chair.

678
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:02,417
I was annoyed.

679
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,792
A presumptuous child
playing on my ship?

680
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:08,083
But I never forgot
how you already knew

681
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:11,166
every control,
every display.

682
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:14,000
You behaved as though you
belonged on the bridge.

683
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:18,083
And then later, when I decided
to make you an acting ensign

684
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,917
I was convinced you could be
an outstanding officer.

685
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:23,583
And I never questioned
that conviction...

686
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,458
until now.

687
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:33,083
The first duty of
every Starfleet officer

688
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,583
is to the truth-- whether
it's scientific truth

689
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,792
or historical truth
or personal truth.

690
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:40,792
It is the guiding
principle on which
Starfleet is based.

691
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:42,458
Now, if you can't find it
within yourself

692
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,625
to stand up and tell the truth
about what happened

693
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:46,500
you don't deserve
to wear that uniform.

694
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:49,542
I'm going to make this simple
for you, Mr. Crusher.

695
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,375
Either you come forward
and tell Admiral Brand

696
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:53,583
what really took place,
or I will.

697
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,125
(<i> whispers</i> ): Captain...
Dismissed!

698
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,250
(<i> knock on door</i> )

699
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:17,834
Your message said
it was urgent.

700
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,083
They know, Nick.

701
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:20,083
They know what we did.

702
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,458
Calm down.
Calm down.

703
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:26,041
Now, tell me exactly
what happened.

704
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,750
Captain Picard called me
onto the<i> Enterprise.</i>

705
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:31,542
When I got there, he
told me that he knows.

706
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:33,834
The Kolvoord Maneuver,
the cover-up,<i> everything.</i>

707
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,208
He said that if I
didn't come forward

708
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,166
and tell the truth
<i>now,</i> he would.

709
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,917
You said he figured it out.
Does he have any evidence?

710
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:44,250
No, but he knew exactly
how it happened.

711
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,125
Captain Picard
doesn't know anything.

712
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,750
He has a theory.

713
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,417
So, let him tell the inquiry
what he thinks happened.

714
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:55,542
They'll ask us, "Is it true?"
We'll say, "No, sir."

715
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,291
There's no evidence,
so there's no case.

716
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:00,000
We'll get off
with a reprimand.

717
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,875
I can't call Captain
Picard a liar.

718
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:05,875
Wesley...

719
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:09,250
We have to hang on
just a little bit longer.

720
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:11,583
Then this will all be over.

721
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,709
It's wrong, Nick.

722
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,667
Wesley...

723
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:17,250
No.

724
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,417
I'm going to tell them
what happened.

725
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:31,417
You're going to tell them
what happened?

726
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,834
You...

727
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,417
Alone...

728
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,792
Are going to decide
what happens to me

729
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,542
to Sito, to Jean?

730
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:39,834
<i>You're</i> going to decide that?

731
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:43,500
I'm not going to lie
to them again, Nick.

732
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:46,041
I can't live with it.

733
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:48,417
<i>You</i> can't lie to them.

734
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:49,709
<i>You</i> can't live with this.

735
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,250
<i>You</i> have to tell them
what happened.

736
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:52,208
Who the hell are you?

737
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,250
Nick!

738
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,291
You're going to turn us in!

739
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:55,208
Now, wait a minute...

740
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,458
No,<i> you</i> wait a minute!

741
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,667
He got to you, didn't he?

742
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:10,583
Picard told you some big story
about duty and honor.

743
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:17,041
Well, it must have been
a pretty good speech

744
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:18,834
to make you turn your back
on your friends.

745
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:23,959
We're Starfleet cadets.

746
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,375
We have a duty
to the truth.

747
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:28,709
What about your duty
to your friends?

748
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,500
I got you on this team.

749
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,166
I gave you a chance
when there were upperclassmen

750
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:34,875
waiting in line.

751
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:37,792
I said, "He won't let us down.

752
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:40,000
"He was on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

753
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:42,750
He knows what it's like to trust
somebody with his life."

754
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,000
Well, I guess I was wrong.

755
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:49,375
If we all come forward
together and tell
Admiral Brand...

756
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:52,000
We don't want to come forward.

757
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:55,834
Sito, Jean and me-- we don't
have a problem with this.

758
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,625
But, if you do, then resign
your appointment to the academy

759
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,041
and walk away.

760
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:04,458
Don't make us pay
for your guilty conscience.

761
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,875
You'd let me
do that?

762
00:39:06,917 --> 00:39:10,917
You'd let me throw away my
career just to save your neck?

763
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:13,417
To save the<i> team.</i>

764
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:15,625
That's more important
than you,

765
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,125
and it's more
important than me.

766
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:18,583
And if I were
in your place

767
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:21,208
I'd do it,
without hesitation.

768
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,500
But that's me.

769
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,333
BRAND:
Captain Satelk and I

770
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,333
have gone over
your testimony

771
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,583
and the physical evidence
from the crash.

772
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:46,000
Your statements
cannot be reconciled

773
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:50,000
with the data collected
from the NAVCON satellite.

774
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,834
Your unwillingness to offer
any explanation

775
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,417
for this contradiction

776
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:59,583
is disappointing
and raises suspicion.

777
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:04,583
We cannot escape
the conclusion

778
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,750
that either the data is faulty

779
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:10,000
in some way...

780
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:13,458
or you have lied to us.

781
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,000
However, suspicion
is not proof

782
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,166
and I have no<i> proof</i>

783
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:22,041
that you have lied
to this inquiry.

784
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:24,875
Therefore,
if no further evidence

785
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:27,166
is presented,

786
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:30,959
I have no choice
but to close this investigation.

787
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:46,792
For filing
an inaccurate flight plan

788
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:48,709
and for allowing
Cadet Albert to fly

789
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,333
when you knew
he was having difficulties

790
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,500
I'm ordering
a formal reprimand

791
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:56,750
placed on each
of your permanent records.

792
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:02,125
I'm also revoking
your flight privileges.

793
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:05,500
This inquiry is closed.

794
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:06,583
(<i> bell rings</i> )

795
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:09,166
Sir?

796
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:11,500
I would like to add something
to my testimony.

797
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:15,583
Proceed, Mr. Crusher.

798
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,041
Yesterday, I testified

799
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,834
that the crash occurred
following a Yeager Loop.

800
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:25,125
That is not
entirely true.

801
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,792
We performed a loop,

802
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:29,959
and afterwards
broke formation

803
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,458
and attempted
a Kolvoord Starburst.

804
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,041
(<i> audience murmuring</i> )

805
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:37,709
We knew it
was prohibited.

806
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,083
We knew it was dangerous

807
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,625
but we wanted to do
something spectacular

808
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:45,500
for the commencement
demonstration.

809
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:47,792
We pushed Josh into it,
and he wasn't ready.

810
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:52,208
We thought we
could do it.

811
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,250
We thought we could do anything.

812
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:57,959
We were wrong...

813
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,542
and Josh died.

814
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:06,500
Josh didn't let us down, sir.

815
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:08,500
It wasn't his fault.

816
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:13,083
Mr. Locarno...

817
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:16,709
you are the leader
of Nova Squadron.

818
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,083
Do you have
anything to say?

819
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,542
Mr. Locarno?

820
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,834
No, sir.

821
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:57,291
Mr. Locarno
has been expelled.

822
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:01,208
They should have
expelled all of us.

823
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,166
They very nearly did.

824
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,125
Mr. Locarno made
an impassioned plea

825
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,125
for the rest of you.

826
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:09,250
He said that he'd used
his influence as squadron leader

827
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:12,667
to convince you to attempt
the Kolvoord Maneuver

828
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:14,542
and then to cover up the truth.

829
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:18,000
He asked to take
full responsibility.

830
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,417
He did exactly what
he said he would.

831
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:26,834
He protected the team.

832
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,208
I feel awful.

833
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:31,667
I've let down everyone--

834
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:34,000
my mother,
my friends, you.

835
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,583
You should feel bad.

836
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:39,875
And you will pay
for what you've done.

837
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:43,333
Admiral Brand has decided

838
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:45,417
that in addition
to a formal reprimand

839
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:47,250
your academic credits
for the past year

840
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,458
will be canceled

841
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,458
and you will not advance
with your class.

842
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,834
I understand.

843
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:57,583
It's not going to be easy

844
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:00,375

You have difficult times ahead.

00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:10,834
Yes, sir.

848
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:12,250
Thank you, Captain.

849
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:17,041
You knew what you had to do.

850
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:19,792
I just made sure
that you listened to yourself.
