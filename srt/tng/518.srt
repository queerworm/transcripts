It's a long way down

You have all the symptoms

That would explain

88
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,792
the dizziness and
the headaches.

89
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,959
But there's no
physical evidence.

00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,834

I'll give you 20
cc's of vertazine.

95
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,166
That should clear
up the dizziness,

96
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,917
but finding time to
relax is up... to you.

97
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,291
What? What is it?

98
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,542
Geordi, have you had
these symptoms before?

00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:32,542
No.

00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:33,750

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,834
Yeah, I'm positive.
Why?

00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:39,291
It's funny.

103
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,500
I feel like
we've discussed this before

104
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,000
and I remember giving you
a hypospray for dizziness.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,667
Well, I've never had
these symptoms before today

106
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,959

about another patient.

No.

we'll have to launch

They were, until
the stellar dynamics lab decided

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
they needed to install
new modules.

I recommend we use a

It will perform a
similar function.

I was imagining things.

140
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:08,667
But this morning,

at the same time as I did.

00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,291
to alter the other
ship's trajectory.

185
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,959
Mr. Worf, make it so.

186
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,667
Engaging tractor beam.

187
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,250
Damage report!

188
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,792
Casualty reports coming in
from all over the ship!

189
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:21,166
The starboard nacelle
has sustained a direct impact.

190
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,625
Venting drive plasma.

191
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,959
Initiating emergency
core shutdown!

192
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,333
Inertial dampers failing.

193
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,709
We're losing
attitude control.

194
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:29,959
This is the bridge.

195
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,500
All hands to emergency
escape pods!

196
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,834
The core shutdown
was unsuccessful.

197
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:40,917
We are losing
antimatter containment.

198
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,083
We've got to eject
the engine core!

199
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,000
Ejection systems
are off-line.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,792
Core breach
is imminent.

201
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,333
All hands abandon ship!

202
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,709
Repeat, all hands abandon...

203
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,667
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45652.1.</i>

204
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,166
<i>The</i> Enterprise
<i>has entered an area of space</i>

205
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,792
<i>known as the Typhon Expanse.</i>

206
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,250
<i>We are the first</i>
<i>Starfleet vessel</i>

207
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,417
<i>to chart</i>
<i>this unexplored region.</i>

208
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,333
Sometimes I wonder
if he's stacking the deck.

209
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,667
I assure you,
Commander,

210
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,208
the cards have been
sufficiently randomized.

211
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,583
I hope so.

212
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,375
Eight.

213
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,709
Ace.

214
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,208
Queen.

215
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,500
The dealer receives
a four.

216
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,542
No bet.

217
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,125
DATA:
Ten.

218
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,208
Seven.
No help there.

219
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,458
Pair of ladies
for the Doctor.

220
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,458
Dealer receives
a nine.

221
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:47,041
Doctor?

222
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,917
May I remind you
since you show the highest hand,

223
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:50,333
you control the next bet.

224
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,917
WORF:
Is there something
wrong, Doctor?

225
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:55,917
No.

226
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:57,500
Um, I'll bet ten.

227
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,208
DATA:
Jack.

228
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,250
Four.

229
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,458
Deuce.

230
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,750
Six.

231
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,625
Twenty.

232
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,667
Your 20...

233
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,834
and I'll raise you 50.

234
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,291
You're going to call
my bluff, aren't you?

235
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:26,542
I think I'll quit
while I'm ahead.

236
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:29,375
How did you know
I was going to call your bluff?

237
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,291
I just had a feeling.

238
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,834
Me, too.

239
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:36,792
Ogawa to Dr. Crusher.

240
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,375
Go ahead.

241
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,500
Commander La Forge needs you
in sick bay.

242
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,583
On my way.

243
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,959
At first, I thought the
catwalk was spinning.

244
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,834
As it turns out,
it was me.

245
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,542
I was lucky Ensign Fletcher
was there to grab me.

246
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:04,041
It's a long way down
to the bottom of
the warp core.

247
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,333
You have all the symptoms
of an inner ear infection.

248
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,667
That would explain
the headaches and the dizziness.

249
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:13,417
But there's no physical...

250
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,792
What?

251
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,542
What is it?

252
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,709
Geordi, have you ever had
these symptoms before?

253
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,417
Come to think of it,
I think I have.

254
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:26,250
Do you recall when?

255
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,083
No, I don't.

256
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,834
We've had
this discussion before

257
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:34,959
and I know I've given you
this examination.

258
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,667
Let's check the medical logs.

259
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,000
You've been treated
several times

260
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,291
for headaches
related to your VISOR

261
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,375
but I read no mention
of dizziness.

262
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,542
Must be<i> deja vu.</i>

263
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,792
Both of us?

264
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,625
About the same thing?

265
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:04,375
(<i> humming</i> )

266
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:57,000
(<i> voices murmur indistinctly</i> )

267
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,041
(<i> glass shatters</i> )

268
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,834
(<i> murmuring stops</i> )

269
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,834
Crusher to Picard.

270
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:13,208
Yes, Doctor?

271
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,959
Do you have a minute, Jean-Luc?

272
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,458
My Aunt Adele cured
a lot of sleepless nights

273
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,500
with this steamed milk.

274
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,458
Thank you.

275
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,250
Mmm. Nutmeg.

276
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,250
Whenever I get insomnia

277
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,834
I try to perfect
the recipe.

278
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,542
It was the eeriest feeling.

279
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,959
When the glass broke

280
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,458
it triggered the sensation
even more intensely

281
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,333
that I'd done it
all before.

282
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,500
You know...

283
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,667
earlier, I was reading
this book

284
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,750
and I had
the distinct feeling

285
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,917
that I'd read
certain paragraphs before.

286
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:05,625
But I assumed that I'd
read the book years ago

287
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,166
and I'd forgotten.

288
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:12,041
I've had this feeling
for hours...

289
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,208
and then the voices.

290
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,458
Well...

291
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

292
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:21,709
...it could be nothing more than
the result of a sleepless night

293
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,166
but let's be sure.

294
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,834
Have Data and Geordi run
a ship-wide diagnostic

295
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:26,917
concentrating
on the time and place

296
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:28,458
when you heard the voices.

297
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,959
And we'll discuss the results
tomorrow at 0700 hours.

298
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:35,291
Thank you...

299
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,875
for everything.

300
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,625
Uh-uh. Thank aunt Adele.

301
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,709
The internal scans
were negative.

302
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:51,917
There was no evidence
of auditory anomalies

303
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,083
anywhere on the ship.

304
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,333
As far as the sensors
are concerned

305
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,917
nothing unusual happened
last night.

306
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:59,375
Ten other people
reported hearing voices

307
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,875
at the same time I did.

308
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:02,959
WORF:
Bridge to Captain Picard.

309
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,083
Go ahead.

310
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,375
We are getting unusual readings

311
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,709
20,000 kilometers
off the starboard bow.

312
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:10,875
PICARD: On our way.

313
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,125
Report.

314
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,375
RO:
Sensors didn't detect
the phenomenon

315
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,750
until we were almost
on top of it, sir.

316
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,000
WORF:
There's a highly
localized distortion

317
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,750
of the space-time
continuum.

318
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,375
On screen.

319
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:36,000
Back us off, Ensign.

320
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,041
Nice and slow.

321
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,208
Aye, sir.

322
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,291
Captain, maneuvering thrusters
are not responding.

323
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,750
The distortion field
is fluctuating.

324
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,500
All main systems
just went down.

325
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,083
Power levels
are dropping rapidly.

326
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,875
RIKER:
Red alert.

327
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,583
DATA:
There is an energy buildup
in the distortion field.

328
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,792
We have to get
out of here now.

329
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:02,250
DATA:
Captain, something
is emerging.

330
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,041
RIKER:
Shields up.

331
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,625
Evasive maneuvers.

332
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:09,834
Shields inoperative.

333
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,709
The helm is
not responding.

334
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:13,458
The vessel is on
a collision course.

335
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,667
Impact in
36 seconds.

336
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,000
Hail them.

337
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,542
No response.

338
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,709
Suggestions?

339
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:23,500
Decompress
main shuttle bay.

340
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
The explosive reaction
may blow us out of the way.

341
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,125
Captain, I suggest we use
the tractor beam

342
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,917
to alter
the other ship's trajectory.

343
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,834
Make it so, Mr. Worf.

344
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:33,291
Engaging tractor beam.

345
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,583
Damage report!

346
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,041
Casualty reports coming in
from all over the ship!

347
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,417
Starboard nacelle has sustained
a direct impact.

348
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,500
We are venting
drive plasma.

349
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,125
Initiating
emergency core shutdown.

350
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,417
Inertial dampers failing.

351
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:54,125
We're losing
attitude control.

352
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,375
This is the bridge.

353
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,500
All hands
to emergency escape pods!

354
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,667
The core shutdown
was unsuccessful.

355
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,000
We are losing
antimatter containment.

356
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,625
We've got to
eject the core!

357
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,875
Ejector systems are off-line.

358
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,500
Core breach is imminent.

359
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,208
All hands, abandon ship!

360
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,834
Repeat,
all hands, abandon...

00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,917
<i>to chart</i>
<i>this unexplored region.</i>

366
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:38,667
Sometimes I wonder
if he's stacking the deck.

367
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:39,875
I assure you,
Commander,

368
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,041
the cards are
sufficiently randomized.

369
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,000
I hope...

370
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,083
so.

371
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,792
Something wrong, Mr. Worf?

372
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:53,041
I am experiencing
<i>nib'poh--</i>

373
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,166
the feeling I have
done this before.

374
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,625
Yes, last Tuesday night.

375
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,000
That's not
what I mean.

376
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I've been having
the same feeling.

377
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,333
Keep dealing, Data.

378
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,291
Eight.
Ace.

379
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,291
A queen. You're going
to give me a queen.

380
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,834
And you're
going to get a four.

381
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:23,291
Deal, Data.

382
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,959
But no one has bet.

383
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,417
Forget the bet.
Just deal.

384
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:30,375
Ten.

385
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,375
Seven.

386
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,709
Queen.

387
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,583
Nine.

388
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,291
Jack.

389
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,709
Four.

390
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:40,709
Deuce.

391
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:42,041
Six.

392
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,625
This is highly improbable.

393
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,959
How did we know?

394
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,959
BEVERLY:
Wait.

395
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,291
Crusher to sick bay.

396
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,542
Sick bay here.

397
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,542
Is Commander La Forge there?

398
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:57,083
No, Doctor, he's not.

399
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,709
Wait a minute.

400
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:02,500
He just came in.

401
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,083
You wanted to see me,
Doctor?

402
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,375
Yes.

403
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,083
Captain... have you
been getting the feeling

404
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,917
that you've experienced
certain things before--

405
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,875
a sense of repetition?

406
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,291
Yes, recently.

407
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,291
While I was reading.

408
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,667
Why do you ask?

409
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:28,834
There have been
similar incidents

410
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,542
reported all
over the ship.

411
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:33,792
Feelings of<i> deja vu.</i>

412
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,291
I had a premonition

413
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,875
Geordi was going to
come into sick bay.

414
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,959
A few seconds
later, he did

415
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:41,375
with the symptoms
of an ear infection.

416
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,792
I was going to run
the standard tests

417
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,291
but somehow, I had a feeling

418
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,750
that they would
turn out negative.

419
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:50,125
So, I ran an
optical diagnostic

420
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,542
which traced
the problem

421
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,792
to Geordi's VISOR.

422
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,417
His dizziness
is being caused

423
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,875
by a phase shift
in his visual receptors.

424
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,208
It's causing him to see
images that aren't there.

425
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:03,458
They're like
blurry afterimages.

426
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,333
I ran a scan to see
if I could detect

427
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,542
what he was seeing.

428
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:08,542
I picked up
minuscule distortions

429
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:10,917
in the surrounding
dekyon field.

430
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,625
Somehow, his VISOR
is translating

431
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,750
those distortions
into visual impulses.

432
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,875
Could be a malfunction
in the ship's

433
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:16,959
warp-field generator.

434
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,125
I'll check it out.

435
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,208
Run a localized
subspace scan

436
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,375
to look for
anything else.

437
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,709
Aye, sir.

438
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,583
Keep me advised.

439
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:30,291
(<i> voices murmur indistinctly</i> )

440
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,917
(<i> murmuring stops</i> )

441
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:40,750
Crusher to Commander La Forge.

442
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,083
La Forge here.

443
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:45,250
Geordi, I just heard
what sounded like

444
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,041
voices in my room
but no one else is here.

445
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,750
Sensors just picked up
something strange, too.

446
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,750
We're checking it out.

447
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,500
I'm on my way.

448
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:58,417
(<i> glass shatters</i> )

449
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:06,667
Looks like you managed
to record 6.2 seconds' worth.

450
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:08,000
Let's see if we can
filter the signal

451
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,333
and clear it up
a little bit.

452
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,917
Then I wasn't just
hearing things.

453
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:13,208
The sound itself appears
to have been real.

454
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,625
However, the acoustic energy

455
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:17,041
does not correspond
to any ship's system

456
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:19,375
nor to any voice communication
sent at the time you heard it.

457
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:21,792
Then where did
the sound come from?

458
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:23,166
Well, you heard the voices

459
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,834
at the same time
our localized subspace scan

460
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:26,917
picked up
a dekyon field distortion.

461
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:30,458
The two may be related.
Let's give another listen.

462
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,500
(<i> voices murmuring</i>
<i>indistinctly )</i>

463
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,041
(<i> murmuring stops</i> )

464
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:39,917
Computer, perform a
narrow bandwidth analysis.

465
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:42,333
Eliminate all non-vocal
waveform components.

466
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:47,000
(<i> voices grow louder</i>
<i>and more distinct</i> )

467
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,542
Can we isolate the voices?

468
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:52,166
Find out what
they're saying?

469
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,917
Computer,
continuous playback please.

470
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:57,667
(<i> voices replaying</i> )

471
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:04,458
(<i> voice replay continues</i> )

472
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:08,583
There are approximately
1,000 voices overlapping.

473
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:12,500
The voices are those
of the<i> Enterprise</i> crew.

474
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,834
Our voices.

475
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,583
I'm sorry to call
you all here so early

476
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,959
but we couldn't wait
till 0700 hours.

477
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,917
We think we may
have an explanation

478
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:37,500
for the odd occurrences
around here.

479
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,750
Commander.

480
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,500
This is going to sound
pretty wild.

481
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,834
Somehow, we've entered

482
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:46,709
what seems to be
a temporal causality loop.

483
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:49,083
We think we're stuck
in a specific fragment in time

484
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,875
and that we've been repeating
that same fragment

485
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,208
over and over again.

486
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,542
Is this what's
causing our<i> deja vu?</i>

487
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:56,250
Yes, but it's
more than that.

488
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,125
In<i> deja vu,</i> you
only think you're
repeating events.

489
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,917
We actually are.

490
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:02,333
Our theory is this:

491
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,375
Every time
the loop begins again

492
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:07,208
everything resets itself
and starts all over.

493
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,458
We don't remember anything
that happened before

494
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:12,291
so each time through the loop,
we think it's the first.

495
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,792
You mean we could have come
into this room

496
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,458
sat at this table
and had this conversation

497
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:16,959
a dozen times already?

498
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,375
A dozen, a hundred.

499
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,875
It's impossible to tell.

500
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,166
We could have been
trapped here

501
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:23,458
for hours, days...

502
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,792
maybe years.

503
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:27,375
CRUSHER:
If what we're
saying is true

504
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,917
those voices I heard

505
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:31,250
might have been echoes
from previous loops.

506
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,166
It's the same with
the phase shift in my VISOR--

507
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,500
afterimages in time.

508
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:40,041
If you're right about this,
how did it happen?

509
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:41,417
How did we get there?

510
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:42,500
DATA:
I have a hypothesis

511
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,375
that may explain that, Captain.

512
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:47,166
I have analyzed the recording
Dr. Crusher made.

513
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,709
Most of it is quite ordinary.

514
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,834
150 discussions
about ship operations.

515
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:54,667
252 conversations
of a personal nature.

516
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,959
Five couples engaged
in romantic encounters...

517
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,750
Your point, Mr. Data.

518
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,291
There is evidence

519
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:03,291
of some sort of disaster
aboard the<i> Enterprise</i>

520
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:04,625
severe enough that the Captain

521
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,458
ordered all hands
to abandon ship.

522
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:09,542
I have isolated three segments

523
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:11,500
of this recording
that are crucial.

524
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,625
WORF (<i> distorted voice</i> ):
A highly localized distortion

525
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,291
of the space-time continuum.

526
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:17,375
DATA:
Collision course.

527
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:20,125
Impact in 36 seconds.

528
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,917
PICARD:
All hands abandon ship!

529
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,458
Repeat, all hands aban...

530
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,709
(<i> recording stops</i> )

531
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:27,417
LA FORGE:
Worf refers
to a distortion.

532
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:29,458
If this were a
temporal distortion--

533
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,875
and if we were
close enough to it--

534
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,208
it's possible that a
large enough explosion

535
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,709
might have ruptured
the space-time continuum.

536
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:37,208
We collided, exploded,

537
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,917
then got caught in this
repeating loop of time.

538
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,625
If you're right,
perhaps we could escape

539
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:43,208
from the loop
by avoiding the collision.

540
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:44,667
That's our guess.

541
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:47,333
Perhaps we should
reverse course.

542
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,750
For all we know,
reversing course

543
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,625
may be what leads us
into the crash.

544
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,792
No.

545
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:55,834
We can't afford to start
second-guessing ourselves.

546
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,041
We'll stay on this course

547
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,834
until we have reason
to change it.

548
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:02,333
But let's do everything that we
can to avoid the collision.

549
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:04,083
LA FORGE:
Captain, we might
not be able

550
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,875
to figure out
how to avoid this accident

551
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:06,917
until it's too late.

552
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:08,458
And if the loop begins again,

553
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,750
we'll forget everything
we learned this time around.

554
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:14,917
What do you suggest?

555
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:16,959
If we<i> do</i> find a way to avoid
this collision

556
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:20,125
we should try to send that
information into the next loop.

557
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,083
Is that possible?

558
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:25,458
We have seen that echoes or
afterimages from previous loops

559
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:28,917
appear as distortions
in the dekyon field.

560
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,709
We may be able
to send a deliberate echo

561
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:32,208
into the next loop.

562
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,625
Like a message
in a bottle.

563
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:34,792
Exactly.

564
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:36,458
We could enhance
a dekyon emission

565
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:37,875
to create
a specific pattern

566
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,375
and send ourselves
a message.

567
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:42,333
Not a long one, probably
only a few characters.

568
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:44,000
Maybe one word.

569
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,250
How do we know we'll pick up
that word the next time through?

570
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,542
If the dekyon emission
is modulated correctly

571
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,375
it will set up resonances

572
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,583
in my positronic
subprocessors.

573
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,000
I will receive the information

574
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,542
on what you would call
a subconscious level.

575
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:58,917
LA FORGE:
Now, there's
the catch.

576
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,417
We have no way of knowing

577
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:02,792
how this information will
be perceived by Data.

578
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:05,917
It might be like a
posthypnotic suggestion.

579
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:08,417
Even with all these
uncertainties, we've got to try.

580
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:10,542
Take whatever steps are
necessary to send a message.

581
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,041
Dismissed.

582
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:14,917
LA FORGE:
You know, it's possible

583
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:16,542
we've tried this
a thousand times

584
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:19,375
and it's
never worked.

585
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,375
Do you have the feeling

586
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,542
that you've done
this before?

587
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:22,583
No, I don't.

588
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,625
Neither do I.

589
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,667
Maybe that's a good sign.

590
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,083
Let's test
the emitter.

591
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:33,875
Particle accelerators
at full power.

592
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,709
Dekyon field active.

593
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,166
Particle flux nominal.

594
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:40,250
We're in business.

595
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,417
All we need now
is a message.

596
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:44,333
RIKER:
Senior officers,
report to the bridge.

597
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:45,667
On our way.

598
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:48,667
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

599
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,667
RIKER:
We've got to figure out
how we handled this before.

600
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,792
PICARD:
Back us off, Ensign.

601
00:30:56,792 --> 00:30:58,125
Nice and slow.

602
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,875
Aye, sir.

603
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,500
Captain, maneuvering thrusters
are not responding.

604
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,709
The distortion field
is fluctuating.

605
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,458
All main systems
just went down.

606
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:13,291
Power levels
are dropping rapidly.

607
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:16,166
There is an energy buildup
in the distortion field.

608
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,458
We have to get
out of here now.

609
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:20,458
DATA:
Captain, something
is emerging.

610
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,542
RIKER:
Shields up.
Evasive maneuvers.

611
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,125
Shields inoperative.

612
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,500
The helm's not responding.

613
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,667
The vessel is on
a collision course.

614
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:32,333
Impact in
36 seconds.

615
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,041
Hail them.

616
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,625
No response.

617
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,750
Suggestions?

618
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,250
Decompress main shuttle bay.

619
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,375
The explosive reaction
may blow us out of the way.

620
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,291
Captain, I suggest
we use the tractor beam

621
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:49,625
to alter the other
ship's trajectory.

622
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,458
Make it so, Mr. Worf.

623
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,917
Engaging tractor beam.

624
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,166
Damage report!

625
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,625
Casualty reports are coming in
from all over the ship!

626
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:05,041
Starboard nacelle has
sustained a direct impact.

627
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:07,417
We are venting
drive plasma.

628
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:10,041
Initiating emergency
core shutdown.

629
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:12,792
Inertial dampers failing.
We're losing attitude control.

630
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,333
This is the bridge!

631
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,417
All hands
to emergency escape pods!

632
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,959
DATA:
Core shutdown
is unsuccessful.

633
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:24,500
We are losing
antimatter containment.

634
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,792
We've got to eject the core!

635
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:28,875
Ejection systems
are off-line.

636
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,291
Core breach is imminent.

637
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:32,667
PICARD:
All hands,
abandon ship!

638
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,750
Repeat,
all hands aban...

639
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:46,208
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45652.1.</i>

640
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:48,625
<i>The Enterprise has entered</i>

641
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,458
<i>known as the Typhon Expanse.</i>

00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,041
<i>We are the first</i>

<i>to chart</i>

644
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:58,458
RIKER:
Sometimes I wonder
if he's stacking the deck.

645
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,917
I assure you,
Commander

646
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:01,667
the cards are sufficiently
randomized.

647
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,709
I hope so.

648
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:07,750
Something wrong,
Mr. Worf?

649
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,917
I am experiencing
<i>nib'poh--</i>

650
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,667
the feeling
I have done this before.

651
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,792
Yeah. Last Tuesday night.

652
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,208
That is not what I mean.

653
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:19,000
I've been having
the same feeling.

654
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,667
Wait.

655
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,000
An eight, an ace,

656
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
a queen
and a four.

657
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,792
Deal the cards, Data.

658
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,500
Three. All threes.

659
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,959
BEVERLY:
I was positive

660
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:39,417
I knew what cards
were going to be dealt.

661
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,667
I was also sure.

662
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,125
Finish dealing
the hand.

663
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,375
Look at this.

664
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,834
We've all got
three of a kind.

665
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,917
First we get a three,

666
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:05,208
and then three of a kind.

667
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:07,959
Ogawa to Dr. Crusher.

668
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,291
Go ahead.

669
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:11,041
Commander La Forge needs you
in sick bay.

670
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,291
I'm on my way.

671
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,834
At first, I thought
the catwalk was spinning.

672
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:27,333
As it turns out, it was me.

673
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,083
I was lucky Ensign Fletcher
was there to grab me.

674
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:32,583
It's a long way down
to the bottom of the warp core.

675
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:33,709
BEVERLY:
You have
all the symptoms

676
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:35,417
of an inner
ear infection.

677
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:38,166
That would explain
the headaches, dizziness.

678
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:41,166
But I don't see any
physi... cal...

679
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:43,083
What?

680
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,500
What is it?

681
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,041
Geordi, have you
ever had these
symptoms before?

682
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:50,959
Now that you mention it,
I think I have.

683
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,834
Do you recall when?

684
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:55,166
No... I don't.

685
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,500
I know we've had
this discussion before

686
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,834
and I remember giving you
this examination.

687
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:02,792
Let's check
the medical logs.

688
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:11,500
You've been treated
several times

689
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,917
for headaches
related to your VISOR

690
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:15,375
but there's no mention
of dizziness.

691
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:17,208
Must be<i> deja vu.</i>

692
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,000
Both of us?

693
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,667
About the same thing?

694
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:24,375
I'd like to run an
optical diagnostic.

695
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:27,041
For an ear infection?

696
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,333
I have a hunch.

697
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,458
Now hold still,
this pulse

698
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,000
may be
a little bright.

699
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,417
(<i> groans</i> )

700
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:45,875
Have you made
any changes

701
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,208
to your VISOR
lately?

702
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:49,792
No, why?

703
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:52,625
I'm detecting
a small phase shift

704
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,959
in your visual receptors.

705
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:32,291
Crusher to Captain Picard.

706
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,500
Yes, Doctor?

707
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,542
Can you come
to sick bay immediately?

708
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:35,750
It's urgent.

709
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,959
I'm on my way.

710
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,291
His dizziness
is being caused

711
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,041
by a phase shift
in his visual receptors.

712
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,750
It's causing him to see things
that aren't there.

713
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,917
They're like
blurry afterimages.

714
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,333
I ran a scan to see if I could
detect what he was seeing.

715
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,625
I picked up
minuscule distortions

716
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,875
in the surrounding dekyon field.

717
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:04,917
His VISOR seems
to be translating

718
00:37:04,917 --> 00:37:07,834
those distortions
into visual impulses.

719
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,709
Could be a malfunction in
the ship's warp field generator.

720
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:11,917
I'll check it out.

721
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,417
While you're at it
run a localized

722
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:15,375
subspace scan

723
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:16,834
Aye, sir.

724
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,333
Keep me advised, Doctor.

725
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,208
LA FORGE:
Lateral sensors on line.

726
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,500
Subspace scanners active.

727
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,375
Data, would you run
a Level-2 diagnostic

728
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:31,417
on the warp subsystems?

729
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,667
All threes.

730
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:40,917
That can't be right.

731
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:42,333
I have encountered
the numeral three

732
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,667
an inordinate number of times

733
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:45,000
over the last two hours.

734
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,917
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

735
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:49,583
We have a dekyon field
fluctuation

736
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:53,041
on deck nine, section 28.

737
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,333
Crusher to Commander La Forge.

738
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:55,792
La Forge here.

739
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:57,875
I just heard what sounded
like voices in my room

740
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,500
but there's no one here.

741
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,834
Sensors just picked up
something strange, too.

742
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:03,083
We're checking it out.

743
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,125
I'm on my way down.

744
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,750
(<i> glass shattering</i> )

745
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,208
Dr. Crusher,
are you all right?

746
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm fine.

747
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,709
DATA:
I have isolated
three segments

748
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,375
of this recording
that are crucial.

749
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:17,208
WORF:
A highly localized distortion

750
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:19,166
of the space-time continuum.

751
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,667
DATA:
Collision course.

752
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,458
Impact in 36 seconds.

753
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:24,417
PICARD:
All hands, abandon ship!

754
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:27,083
Repeat, all hands, aba...

755
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:29,375
Worf refers
to a distortion.

756
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,500
If this were
a temporal distortion

757
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,000
and if we were
close enough to it

758
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,333
it's possible that a
large enough explosion

759
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:37,917
might have ruptured the
space-time continuum.

760
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:40,417
We collided,
exploded

761
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:43,417
then got stuck in this
repeating loop of time.

762
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:45,208
If you're right about this
then perhaps

763
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:46,875
we can escape from the loop
by avoiding the collision.

764
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,250
That's our guess.

765
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,709
WORF:
Perhaps we should
reverse course.

766
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:51,000
For all we know,
reversing course

767
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,917
might be what leads
us to the crash.

768
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:54,834
We can't afford to start
second-guessing ourselves.

769
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:56,291
We should stay
on this course

770
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,250
until we have reason
to change it.

771
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,083
But in the meantime,
I think we should do

772
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,667
what we can to avoid
a collision.

773
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,917
Captain, we've
been seeing the
number three

774
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:07,291
all over the ship--
on consoles,

775
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:08,500
in a poker game.

776
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,083
DATA:
To date, we
have encountered

777
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:13,500
2,085 conspicuous examples
of the number three.

778
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,667
All of these threes
can't be coming up by accident.

779
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:19,458
Maybe someone's trying
to tell us something.

780
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,750
We came to
the same conclusion,

781
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,834
so we ran
a ship-wide diagnostic.

782
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:24,625
The only unusual
thing we found was

783
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:26,000
a dekyon field
modulation

784
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,291
in Data's positronic
subprocessors.

785
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:30,208
What could be causing it?

786
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,834
I don't know,
but if I wanted

787
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:33,875
to send information from
one loop into the next

788
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,417
I might use a method
like a dekyon emission.

789
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,959
You think we sent
ourselves a message?

790
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,542
It would make sense.

791
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,291
Maybe we are trying to
tell ourselves something.

792
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:45,709
If that were true,
what could three indicate?

793
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:47,583
Maybe we should run
a Level-3 diagnostic

794
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,834
on all key systems.

795
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:50,333
LA FORGE:
That's a good idea.

796
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,542
I'll have the computer
run a pattern-matching

797
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:52,792
algorithm on
the number three.

798
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:54,333
RO:
Bridge to Captain Picard.

799
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,542
Go ahead.

800
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:57,041
We're getting unusual readings

801
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:59,959
20,000 kilometers
off the starboard bow.

802
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,709
On our way.

803
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:04,583
(<i> alarm buzzing</i> )

804
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,750
Report.

805
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,333
Sensors didn't detect
the phenomenon

806
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:14,000
until we were almost
on top of it, Captain.

807
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,166
WORF:
It is a highly
localized distortion

808
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,166
of the space-time continuum.

809
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,500
On screen.

810
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:25,625
How do you think we
handled this before?

811
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:29,333
Back us off, Ensign.

812
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,250
Nice and slow.

813
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,625
Aye, sir.

814
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,500
Captain, maneuvering thrusters
are not responding.

815
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,417

00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,500
There is an energy buildup
in the distortion field.

819
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,166
We have to get
out of here now.

820

Shields inoperative.

Suggestions?

Decompress
main shuttle bay.

832
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,959
The explosive reaction
may kick us out of the way.

833
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:17,500
Captain, I suggest
we use the tractor beam

834
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,583
to alter the other
ship's trajectory.

835
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:20,959
Make it so, Mr. Worf.

836
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:23,917
WORF:
Engaging tractor beam.

837
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:35,875
The tractor beam
will not be successful.

838
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:37,625
I am decompressing
the main shuttle bay.

839
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,875
(<i> loud whooshing</i> )

840
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,083
We are clear
of the distortion.

841
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,250
Data, what happened?

842
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,041
At the last moment,
I speculated

843
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:02,125
that "three" might
refer to the number
of rank insignia

844
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:03,375
on Commander
Riker's uniform.

845
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:05,041
That indicated to me

846
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:08,333
that his suggestion
might be the correct
course of action.

847
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,625
Data, you must have
picked up a message

848
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:12,250
we sent from
the last loop

849
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,834
and stacked the deck
in the poker game

850
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:15,125
without realizing it.

851
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,959
That is possible.

852
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,041
I may also have
inadvertently been responsible

853
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:22,834
for the unexplained occurrences
of the number three.

854
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:26,000
Mr. Worf, end red alert.

855
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,792
And try to access
a Federation time base beacon.

856
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,458
Let's see if we can find out

857
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:33,667
how long we've been
in this causality loop.

858
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,792
Time base confirms
our chronometers are off

859
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:40,750
by 17.4 days.

860
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:48,709
Reset them, Mr. Data.

861
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:50,792
Aye, sir.

862
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:53,500
Captain, we are being hailed
by the other vessel.

863
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,417
Computer identifies it
as the USS<i> Bozeman--</i>

Soyuz-class?

867
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,625
They haven't been in service
in over 80 years.

868
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:08,625
Open a channel.

869
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:11,083
This is Captain Morgan Bateson

870
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:12,792
of the Federation
Starship<i> Bozeman.</i>

871
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:14,375
Can we render assistance?

00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:17,166
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard

873
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:19,750
of the Federation starship
<i>Enterprise.</i>

874
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,333
We were just going to
ask you the same thing.

875
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,333
Captain Picard, your vessel
is not familiar to us.

876
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,959
Captain, have you any idea
what has just happened?

877
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:34,083
Our sensors detected
a temporal distortion.

878
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:35,166
Then your ship appeared.

879
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:36,458
We nearly hit you.

880
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:38,709
The<i> Enterprise</i>
has been caught up

881
00:43:38,709 --> 00:43:42,000
in a temporal causality loop,
and I suspect

882
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,792
that something similar
may have happened to you.

883
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:45,083
You must be mistaken.

884
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,917
We left Starbase
only three weeks ago.

885
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:54,417
Captain...

886
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:55,959
do you know what year this is?

887
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:57,083
Of course I do.

888
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:58,625
It's 2278.

889
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:04,500
Perhaps you should
beam aboard our ship.

890
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:09,542
There's something
