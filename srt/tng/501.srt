1
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:05,041
<i>Last time on</i> Star Trek:
The Next Generation.

2
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:07,959
We will have to move quickly
if we are to be successful.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,417
Successful?

4
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:13,709
Yes. In preventing
a Klingon Civil War.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,959
I would speak with you.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,834
I do not hear
the words of traitors.

7
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,125
It was Duras' father

8
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:23,083
who betrayed our people
to the Romulans at Khitomer,

9
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,375
not mine.

10
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:25,875
We have discovered

11
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:30,041
that our brother did indeed
have a son and heir.

12
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,083
Follow me and I will
show you honor.

13
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,542
Your blood will paint
the way to the future.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,000
If we go to the aid of
the<i> Bortas,</i>

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,750
we'll be dragging the Federation
into a Klingon Civil War.

16
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:47,417
GOWRON: You both
fought as warriors.

17
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:50,291
I return your family honor.

18
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,083
Mr. Worf, your responsibilities
as a Starfleet officer

19
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,917
are incompatible
with remaining onboard

20
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,959
a Klingon ship during
a time of war.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,792
Then I resign my commission
as a Starfleet officer.

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,917
Picard has rejected
Gowron's plea for help.

23
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,417
(<i> chuckles</i> )

24
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,709
The<i> Enterprise</i>
has left orbit.

25
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:16,125
We should not discount
Jean-Luc Picard yet.

26
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,500
He is human...

27
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:20,208
and humans have a way
of showing up

28
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,875
when you least expect them.

29
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,375
<i>And now the conclusion.</i>

30
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:33,750
KURN: Maintain course.
Status of warp engines.

31
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,250
Warp engines at 60%.

32
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,125
KURN:
Status of shields.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,625
Aft shields
buckling.

34
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:46,959
Transfer auxiliary power
to shields.

35
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,625
Aft shields are gone.

36
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,917
We cannot win.
We must withdraw.

37
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,667
Keep your place.

38
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:12,625
New course... 307,
mark 275.

39
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,792
But, sir, that takes us
dangerously close to the--

40
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,000
<i>GhoS!</i>

41
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,583
WORF: We are entering
the star's corona.

42
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,583
We will reach the photosphere
in 30 seconds.

43
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,166
Standby to enter
warp on my command.

44
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:36,500
Set course 250, mark 015.

45
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,542
Shields failing.

46
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,250
Outer hull temperature
exceeding design limit.

47
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,959
Captain!

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,542
Maintain course.

49
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,792
They're
closing on us.

50
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:57,500
Standby.

51
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,917
<i>Dah!</i>

52
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:31,250
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45020.4.</i>

53
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,375
<i>We have arrived at Starbase 234</i>

54
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,000
<i>where I've taken</i>
<i>the opportunity</i>

55
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,875
<i>to make a proposal</i>
<i>to Fleet Admiral Shanthi.</i>

56
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,542
There have been
three major engagements

57
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,709
in the past two weeks,
all of them won

58
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,417
by ships loyal to
the Duras family.

59
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,375
None of which is
our concern, Jean-Luc.

60
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:50,417
The Klingon Civil War is,
by definition,

61
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,250
an internal matter
of the empire.

62
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:56,083
Agreed. But if the Duras are
being aided by the Romulans,

63
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,709
it becomes very much
our concern.

64
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,375
The Romulans have been
attempting to destroy

65
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:04,125
the Klingon Federation
Alliance for the past 20 years.

66
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,166
And at the same time, the Duras

67
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,542
have been secretly conspiring
with the Romulans.

68
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,834
Doesn't it strike you as odd

69
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,291
that the Duras
are able to field

70
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,500
such an overpowering
force against Gowron,

71
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:15,583
that they outmatch him
at almost every turn?

72
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,625
Some would call it
good leadership.

73
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:21,041
And some would say that
they must be getting help.

74
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,208
The Romulans are prepared
to take enormous risks

75
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,333
to gain any advantage
over the Federation.

76
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:29,041
Can we seriously believe
that now, with the future

77
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,959
of the Klingon Empire
in the balance,

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,625
they are content
to standby and watch?

79
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,583
What is it you propose, Captain?

80
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,792
We must stop the flow
of supplies and equipment

81
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:44,291
to the Duras from
the Romulans.

82
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,250
What I propose
is that we send a fleet

83
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,500
to the Romulan/Klingon border.

84
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:54,500
We take no offensive action,
but we will be in a position

85
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:56,875
to expose any Romulan supplies

86
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,458
that attempt to cross
the border.

87
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,750
A blockade?

88
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:01,083
Exactly.

89
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,625
But how will you overcome

90
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:05,750
the Romulan
cloaking device?

91
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:08,125
My chief engineer
has developed a system

92
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,208
that should nullify
that advantage.

93
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,917
Each ship will send out
an active tachyon beam

94
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,375
to the other
blockading ships.

95
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,083
Now, in theory,

96
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,583
any cloaked vessel

97
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,667
that attempts to pass
between our ships

98
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:25,583
must cross that beam
and be detected.

99
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,959
I'll have to clear this
with the Federation Council.

100
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:36,625
In the meantime,
assemble your fleet, Captain.

101
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,333
Nicely done.

102
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,959
I hope we know
what we're doing.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,625
So do I, Number One.

104
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:17,959
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,625
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

106
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,750
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

107
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:27,291
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

108
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:31,709
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

109
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,250
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

110
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,041
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45021.3.</i>

111
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:39,083
<i>Convincing Starfleet Command</i>
<i>to establish a blockade</i>

112
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,709
<i>was relatively painless.</i>

113
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,959
<i>Implementing that plan</i>
<i>is proving more troublesome.</i>

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,166
RIKER:
Starfleet is stretched

115
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,709
pretty thin across
this quadrant.

116
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,083
There are only
about 12 ships

117
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,792
within a day's travel
at this position.

118
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,041
The only others ships available

119
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,333
are either in Spacedock
for repairs

120
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,750
or still
under construction.

121
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,792
Most of 'em don't even
have full crews yet.

122
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:58,667
We could probably scare up
seven, maybe eight more ships.

123
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:01,166
Mr. La Forge, can you implement
your tachyon detection grid

124
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,959
with 20 ships?
LA FORGE: It's possible.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,583
But the more ships,

126
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,000
the bigger the net
we can throw.

127
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,417
All right, I want to add
the<i> Tian An Men,</i>

128
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,417
the<i> Sutherland,</i>
and the<i> Hermes,</i>

129
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,709
whether the yard superintendent
says they're ready or not.

130
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,417
Mr. Data, will you
select a group

131
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,417
of experienced
<i>Enterprise</i> officers

132
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,500
to augment the crews
of those ships?

133
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,959
Aye, sir.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,417
Will, I want you
to command the<i> Excaliber.</i>

135
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,417
Her crew was reassigned when
she put in for repairs.

136
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,458
Geordi, you will be
his first officer.

137
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,875
Aye, sir.

138
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:31,500
I want the fleet underway
by 0900 tomorrow.

139
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:33,041
Thank you,
gentlemen.

140
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,917
Yes, Mr. Data?

141
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,667
May I ask a question, sir,
of a personal nature?

142
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,875
Yes.

143
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:47,083
I am confused.

144
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,834
Why have I not been
assigned to command

145
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,375
a ship in the fleet, sir?

146
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,917
Well, I felt that you would be
needed here.

147
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,375
Why do you ask?

148
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:58,291
You have commented on the lack
of senior officers

149
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,208
available for this mission.

150
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,291
I believe my 26 years of
Starfleet service

151
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,959
qualifies me for such a post.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,667
However, if you
do not feel

153
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:09,625
the time has arrived for an
android to command a starship,

154
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,750
perhaps I should address
myself to improving--

155
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,458
Commander...

156
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,583
I believe
the starship<i> Sutherland</i>

157
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,959
will need a captain.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,125
I think of no one better suited
for that task than you.

159
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,000
Thank you, sir.

160
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,250
(<i> yelling and growling</i> )

161
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,959
(<i> low growling</i> )

162
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,125

(<i> laughing</i> )

165
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:01,625
You always did have fools
working for you, Larg.

166
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,000
Now, you don't
have as many.

167
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,417
You were lucky, Kurn,
but luck always runs out.

168
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,417
Someday, I will stand
over your broken corpse

169
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,750
and drink to the victory
of the Duras.

170
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:13,000
(<i> laughing</i> )

171
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,875
Ah, Worf...
Worf, good.

172
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:19,083
This piece of<i> baktag</i>
is Captain Larg.

173
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,667
He commanded the squadron

174
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,291
that tried to
destroy us yesterday.

175
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,291
Ah, the infamous Worf,
son of Mogh.

176
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,208
What is that
you are wearing?

177
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,333
That is the uniform
of a Klingon!

178
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,834
(<i> laughs</i> )

179
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,709
The capital city
is neutral ground,

180
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,875
and Larg's men are
all around us,

181
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,375
as are mine.

182
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,625
Good to drink
with you, Kurn.

183
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,000
May you die well.

184
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,959
Die well, Larg.

185
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,375
(<i> growling</i> )

186
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,583
(<i> laughing</i> )

187
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:00,709
You drink with
our enemies?

188
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,333
How many are
Gowron's men?

189
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,750
How many are Duras?

190
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,375
Does it matter?

191
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,667
When we meet in battle,
we will fight to the death.

192
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,500
But here,
here we're all warriors,

193
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,375
all Klingons.

194
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:18,000
The repairs to the<i> Hegh'ta</i>
are proceeding.

195
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,250
The port stabilizers--

196
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,667
Is there nothing in
your heart but duty?

197
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:23,083
It is my responsibility.

198
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:26,083
We all have
responsibilities and duties,

199
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:30,041
but you and I are warriors
fighting in a great war.

200
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,667
Think of it.

201
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:35,291
You and I will fight battles
that others can only dream of.

202
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,125
The time for
glory is here.

203
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,834
It is not a time to worry
about stabilizers.

204
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,625
It is a time to celebrate,

205
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,917
for tomorrow,
we all may die!

206
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,000
(<i> roaring cheers</i> )

207
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,625
Come, let us,
the sons of Mogh,

208
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:53,041
live this night as if
it were our last.

209
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,208
Huh? Huh? Huh?

210
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,917
(<i> roaring cheer</i> )

211
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,333
Worf is not
like his brother.

212
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,083
No.
He tries to be,

213
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,125
but he's still
unsure of himself.

214
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,500
Perhaps he needs something to
help restore his confidence.

215
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:20,125
I think he'll find
our offer appealing.

216
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,750
I'll make sure he does.

217
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,750
You've got to keep
this mixture above 90%

218
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,667
or we'll never leave orbit.

219
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,125
Thank you, Mr. Craig.

220
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,959
I am Lieutenant
Commander Data.

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,875
Lieutenant Commander
Christopher Hobson.

222
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:55,875
By order of Starfleet, I hereby
take command of this vessel.

223
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:58,500
Please note the time
and date in the ship's log.

224
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:02,500
Excuse me, sir.

225
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,917
I'd like to request
a transfer.

226
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,500
May I ask why?

227
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:14,458
I don't believe I'd be a
good first officer for you.

228
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,959
Your service record to date
suggests you would perform

229
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,667
that function adequately.
No, no, no.

230
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,792
That's not what I mean.

231
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:24,041
I don't think I'd be a
good first officer for<i> you.</i>

232
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,750
Why?

233
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:29,041
Frankly, sir, I don't
believe in your ability

234
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,417
to command this ship.

235
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,625
You're a fellow officer
and I respect that,

236
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,250
but no one would suggest

237
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,333
that a Klingon would be
a good ship's counselor,

238
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,041
or that a Berellian
could be an engineer.

239
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,333
They're just not suited
for those positions.

240
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,291
By the same token,
I don't think an android

241
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,291
is a good choice
to be captain.

242
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,667
I understand your concerns.

243
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,583
Request denied.

244
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:01,875
The<i> Endeavor</i> has cleared
the dock, Captain.

245
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:03,208
All ships standing by.

246
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,542
Good.

247
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,375
Course 118, mark 357,
full impulse power.

248
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,291
Signal the fleet
to get underway.

249
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,417
We'll enter warp
once we're clear of the system.

250
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,750
Aye, sir.

251
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,542
Engage.

252
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,375
The Romulan convoy is late.

253
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,709
We need those supplies.

254
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,625
Gowron has suffered another
loss near the Mempa system.

255
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,583
His forces will not
threaten you in that region

256
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,208
for some time.
But if Gowron--

257
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,000
The convoy will arrive
in due course.

258
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,875
A Federation fleet
has left Starbase 234.

259
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:53,041
They've set course for
Klingon territory.

260
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,208
How many?

261
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,375
At least 20 starships.

262
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:57,208
Who is commanding
this fleet?

263
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,291
Picard.

264
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,709
What does it mean?

265
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,000
Is the Federation
going to enter the war?

266
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,750
Should we attack them
before they get here?

267
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,834
Silence the child
or send him away.

268
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,500
Movar.

269
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,917
I want you to return to
Romulus immediately.

270
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,750
Have all available
ships rendezvous

271
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,667
at these coordinates
in two days.

272
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,250
Yes, Commander.

273
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,208
20 starships aren't
enough to wage war.

274
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,750
Starfleet
must be bluffing.

275
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,750
Perhaps.

276
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:33,750
Our forces in the Mempa sector
are now in full retreat.

277
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,875
They will need to regroup
near Beta Lankal.

278
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:40,959
We destroyed their supply bases
in that sector three weeks ago.

279
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,250
How can they
continue to fight?

280
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,250
They must be getting help.

281
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,000
KULGE: Maybe they have
better leaders.

282
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:01,750
I say you have failed
as our leader, Gowron.

283
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,000
There is no time for this.
We must make plans

284
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,500
before those forces
reach Beta Lankal.

285
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,166
How can we
oppose the Duras

286
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,834
when we continue to fight
amongst ourselves?

287
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,500
Gowron must answer this
challenge to his authority.

288
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:21,959
Stop it!

289
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,417
Do we fall upon ourselves
like a pack of Ferengi?!

290
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,959
The enemy is the Duras!

291
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,250
We are at war.

292
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,583
(<i> chuckles</i> )

293
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:50,834
Now, the war can continue.

294
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,542
We're crossing into
Klingon territory, Captain.

295
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,291
Signal the fleet to
maintain yellow alert

296
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,250
until further notice.
Aye, sir.

297
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,709
Begin long-range scans
of the Romulan border.

298
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,041
No uncloaked ships
within sensor range.

299
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,542
A few subspace anomalies,
but nothing firm.

300
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,333
Those anomalies
could be cloaked ships.

301
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,500
Could be, sir.

302
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:19,083
Open a channel to the<i> Excalibur.</i>

303
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,208
RIKER:
<i>Excalibur,</i> Riker here.

304
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,333
Deploy the fleet, Will.

305
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,208
It's time to spread
our net.

306
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,458
RIKER: Yes, sir.

307
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:33,667
We've arrived at the designated
coordinates, Captain.

308
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:37,583
All stop. Notify the flagship
that we have assumed station.

309
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,875
(<i> alarm beeps</i> )

310
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,667
Starboard power coupling
is overloaded.

311
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:44,750
We've got a radiation leak
on decks 10 through 12.

312
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:46,166
Why are the back-ups
not functioning?

313
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,959
There wasn't enough time
to test all the back-ups

314
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,250
before we left the yard.

315
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,917
Terry, I want you
down in Engineering

316
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:54,041
working on a
new coupling.

317
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,542
You have taken the phaser and
torpedo control units off-line.

318
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,667
Keith, you and I will
start bringing--

319
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:01,792
Mr. Hobson, it is inappropriate
for you to determine a course

320
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:05,792
of action without consulting
your commanding officer.

321
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:09,458
I was trying to safeguard the
lives of<i> people</i> on those decks.

322
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,083
But you're right.

323
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,208
Belay those orders,
everyone.

324
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,500
Phasers and torpedoes
are back on-line.

325
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,792
What should we do, sir?

326
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:25,917
You will take the phaser and
torpedo units off-line

327
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:29,166
and begin repairs of
the starboard power coupling.

328
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,709
Thank you, sir.

329
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,250
You heard the captain,
everyone.

330
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,959
We're ready, sir.

331
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,583
Mr. La Forge, how long
do you think it will take

332
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,583
the Romulans to detect
the tachyon field

333
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,333
once it's
activated?

334
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:55,208
Not long-- Romulan sensors
are as good as ours.

335
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,875
Very well.

336
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:58,333
Energize the network.

337
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,583
Commander, there's an increase
in tachyon emissions

338
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,750
from the Federation fleet.

339
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,875
SELA: They're using the beams
as a detection field.

340
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:20,000
If we try to cross it,
they'll see us,

341
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,375
even if we're cloaked.

342
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:27,125
Issue orders to begin work on
a way to penetrate this field.

343
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,667
In the meantime,
we'll have to convince

344
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,959
Captain Picard
he should leave.

345
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,875
Captain, I'm picking up
something directly ahead.

346
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,542
Romulan ship decloaking.

347
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,875
O'BRIEN:
Shall I raise shields?

348
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:45,583
Not yet.

349
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,417
They're hailing us, sir.

350
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,792
On screen.

351
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,834
Tasha.

352
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:03,500
No, Captain.
My name is Commander Sela.

353
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:08,542
The woman you knew as Tasha Yar
was my mother.

354
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:16,291
SELA: Deploying an invasion
fleet along our border

355
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,166
is a clear act
of aggression, Captain.

356
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,875
It will not be tolerated.

357
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:22,125
You have 20 hours
to recall your ships

358
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,792
and return peacefully to
Federation territory.

359
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,417
So, you believe her,
Counselor?

360
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:38,166
I'm not saying we should accept
her claim at face value,

361
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,709
but I sensed
no deception from her.

362
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,333
She really believes she's
the daughter of Tasha Yar.

363
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,500
Regardless of what she believes,
Sela can't be her daughter.

364
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,583
I've reviewed all of
Tasha's medical records,

365
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,750
and there is no indication that
she was ever pregnant.

366
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,750
Besides, Tasha was a child
when this woman was born.

367
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:55,834
Sela could have
been cloned.

368
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,250
Or had her appearance
surgically altered.

369
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,625
But why? What possible advantage
could there be to the Romulans?

370
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,291
As this now stands,

371
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,834
I don't think this will
have any impact

372
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,000
on our present strategy.
We'll continue the blockade.

373
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,583
Leave the next move to them.
Thank you.

374
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,458
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

375
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,583
(<i> door opens</i> )

376
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,500
GUINAN:
Am I intruding?

377
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:23,750
No, not at all.

378
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:25,500
Is something wrong?

379
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:29,000
News travels fast.

380
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,125
I heard that
Tasha Yar's daughter

381
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,125
is aboard the Romulan ship.

382
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,125
I think that the Romulans

383
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,375
are just hoping
to create a distraction.

384
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,250
They want to keep us
off balance.

385
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,583
Hmm.

386
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,041
How much do you know
about what happened

387
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,250
to the last ship
called<i> Enterprise?</i>

388
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,875
The<i> Enterprise-C?</i>

389
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:53,375
It was lost at the
Battle of Narendra III

390
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,834
defending a Klingon outpost
from the Romulans.

391
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,959
And the survivors?

392
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,792
There were stories of prisoners

393
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,333
taken back to Romulus,
but these were only rumors.

394
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,709
No.

395
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,875
There were survivors.

396
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:12,625
And Tasha Yar
was one of them.

397
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,959
Guinan, that was 23 years ago.

398
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,625
Tasha Yar was
only a child.

399
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,333
I know that.

400
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,000
But I also know
she was aboard that ship

401
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,917
and she was not a child.

402
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:31,041
And I think...
you sent her there.

403
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,375
How can that be?

404
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:38,125
I don't know.
I just know that you did.

405
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,000
Tasha died...

406
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,959
a year before you came
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

407
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,208
You never met her.

408
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,959
I know that.

409
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,625
If you have only
a vague intuition--

410
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:54,542
You can't just dismiss this.

411
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,166
If I'm right,

412
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,625
then<i> you</i> are responsible
for this whole situation.

413
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:05,625
I think it's time
that I met Commander Sela.

414
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,959
We are at war.

415
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,667
Gowron should forbid
any challenges

416
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,083
until we are victorious.

417
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:20,291
A Klingon does not postpone
a matter of honor.

418
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,750
A Klingon should place
the good of the empire

419
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,083
above his own pride.

420
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,792
Oh, so now, Gowron
no longer suits you?

421
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:28,500
Perhaps you wish
to challenge him

422
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,208
for the leadership
of the Council.

423
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,333
No!

424
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,667
Then do not speak
of this again.

425
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:35,041
I did not wish
to follow Gowron.

426
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,291
You came to me
and insisted

427
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:41,000
that we support Gowron
against the Duras family.

428
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:44,250
The time for debate is over.

429
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,250
We are Klingons.
He is our leader.

430
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,875
If that is not
enough for you,

431
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,917
then perhaps you made
the wrong choice

432
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:53,250
when you put
on that uniform.

433
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:01,750
(<i> grunting</i> )

434
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,750
(<i> groaning</i> )

435
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,000
Well, Captain,

436
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,667
what is this urgent matter
we need to discuss?

437
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:31,792
Please, won't you sit down?

438
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,875
I'm afraid that
you have misinterpreted

439
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,583
our presence here.

440
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:43,959
I want to reassure you that
we have no hostile intention.

441
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,834
Ah!

442
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,834
So, then I can tell my superiors

443
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:51,208
that a fleet
of 23 Federation starships

444
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,625
is on our border for what?

445
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:56,500
Humanitarian reasons?

446
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:59,834
It is our intent
to prevent any external power

447
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,709
from interfering
in Klingon affairs.

448
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,417
Nor do we have any plan to
do so.

449
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,583
But, Captain,
if for any reason

450
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:10,667
we chose to enter
Klingon territory,

451
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,291
how would you stop us?

452
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,792
With our cloaking devices,
we can slip by you at will.

453
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:17,750
Then why don't you
just take your ships across?

454
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:22,583
You sound eager for us to try.

455
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:26,291
Perhaps you've discovered
a method in detecting our ships?

456
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:32,625
However, I don't think
you asked me here

457
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,834
to discuss
our military situation.

458
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:38,083
All right.
Why did I invite you here?

459
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:43,333
You want the answer to the
only question on your mind--

460
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,792
how could Tasha Yar
be my mother?

461
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:47,125
It's been suggested

462
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,792
that she was on board
the<i> Enterprise-C</i>

463
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:51,208
when it was destroyed
24 years ago,

464
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,625
that she was one
of the survivors

465
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,834
and that obviously,
you are a product

466
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:58,500
of a union between
her and a Romulan.

467
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:02,083
(<i> chuckles</i> )
But you know that's impossible.

468
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,583
She would have been a child
when that battle occurred.

469
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,792
But you claim that
it<i> is</i> possible--

470
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:09,041
that you're the daughter
of Tasha Yar.

471
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:17,542
Yes, she was on that ship
24 years ago.

472
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:22,583
She was sent there
by you from the future.

473
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,667
She was among those
few who survived.

474
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:35,500
They were all to
have been executed

475
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:37,750
after the interrogation,
but a Romulan general

476
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:40,750
saw her and became
enamored with her.

477
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:42,834
So, a deal was struck.

478
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,333
Their lives
would be spared

479
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:47,875
if she became his consort.

480
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:49,875
I was born a year later.

481
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:56,083
I want to meet your mother.
Can you arrange that?

482
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,750
One night when I was
four years old she came to me.

483
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:05,250
She bundled me up and she
told me to stay quiet

484
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,208
as we left the compound.

485
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,083
I realized
she was taking me away.

486
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,667
She was taking me away from
my home, my father,

487
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:15,375
So, I cried out.

488
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:18,500
My father offered her life.
He gave her a home.

489
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:20,250
He gave her a child.

490
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:22,250
And how did she
repay him?

491
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,083
By betrayal.

492
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:27,542
They executed her.

493
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:40,458
Everything in me that was human
died that day with my mother.

494
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,291
All that's left now is Romulan.

495
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:46,000
Never doubt that.

496
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,500
Doubts?
I'm full of them.

497
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,500
(<i> sighs</i> )

498
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,291
But nothing in my experience
can persuade me

499
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,458
that what you have
told me is true.

500
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,834
And I do know one thing--

501
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:02,375
it will not affect my judgment
at our next encounter.

502
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:06,500
You have 14 hours, Captain.

503
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:08,959
I suggest
you use them wisely.

504
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,834
(<i> raspy purring</i> )

505
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,792
(<i> lustful growl</i> )

506
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,208

(<i> laughing</i> )

509
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,959
Something wrong?

510
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,375
Welcome, Worf,
son of Mogh.

511
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:46,792
What do you want?

512
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:48,625
The same as you--

513
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:51,417
personal honor,
glory for the empire.

514
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,542
Your family has never
valued honor.

515
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:57,041
You only knew
our brother.

516
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,250
We are not like him.

517
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:02,041
Our brother
made many mistakes.

518
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:05,041
One was to make
you an enemy.

519
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,542
We would rather
be your friends.

520
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,750
Then you should not
have opposed Gowron.

521
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:11,917
Gowron is nothing.

522
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,875
Toral is Duras'
only son,

523
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:18,458
and he will be the
leader of the Council.

524
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,667
In your heart,
even you know that.

525
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:22,750
But Toral
needs guidance.

526
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:24,959
A firm hand.

527
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,667
A father figure.

528
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:30,166
That could be you...

529
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:33,250
if you were mated
to B'Etor.

530
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:36,166
The rewards could be greater
than you could imagine.

531
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,709
Nothing would
stand in our way.

532
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,875
We could rule the
empire together.

533
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:44,834
Join us, Worf,
and usher in a new

534
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,250
era for our people.

535
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:49,166
Era, where honor has
no meaning?

536
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:55,208
Where Klingons trade loyalties
in dark rooms

537
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,458
and the empire
is ruled from Romulus?

538
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,709
(<i> single beep</i> )

539
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,458
SELA: Enough, Lursa.
You've failed.

540
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,834
I need to know the strength

541
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:07,625
and capabilities of
the Federation fleet.

542
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:10,875
I don't have time for this.
Turn him over to the guard.

543
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:13,750
B'Etor can have him back
when they finish with him.

544
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,333
Come!

545
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,792
In 13 hours, we'll be forced to
either withdraw from the border

546
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,667
or fight the Romulan fleet.

547
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:30,667
Neither alternative
is acceptable.

548
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:33,792
We must expose their
involvement before the deadline.

549
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,667
What is it you propose?

550
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,709
If you launch a
full-scale attack now,

551
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,625
then the Duras fleet will
call for supplies.

552
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,500
Lursa and B'Etor
will call for help.

553
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,959
The Romulans will try
to run the blockade,

554
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,667
and we'll be ready for them.

555
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:52,375
And once the Romulan connection
has been exposed,

556
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,792
support will fall away
from Lursa and B'Etor.

557
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:56,875
Very well.

558
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:59,834
I will make
preparations.

559
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,834
One thing more,
Picard.

560
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:07,291
Worf has been captured
by the Duras.

561
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,500
I hope he dies well.

562
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:12,917
<i>Qapla'!</i>

563
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:23,208
When Gowron begins his attack,
then we will make our move.

564
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,583
<i>Excalibur</i> will fall back
with engine problems.

565
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,875
And you will take the
<i>Akagi</i> and the<i> Hornet</i>

566
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,417
to this position,
which will open

567
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:31,542
a small gap in
our detection net.

568
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,792
And if the Romulans are already
aware of the tachyon field,

569
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:35,500
they should run the
blockade at that point.

570
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:37,583
Exactly, but when they try
to bring their ships through,

571
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,750
the<i> Enterprise</i>
and the<i> Tian An Men</i>

572
00:31:39,792 --> 00:31:43,000
will swing around,
close the gap...

573
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:44,750
catch them in the act.

574
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:49,166
Very nice.

575
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,750
I'd better get back.

576
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:53,917
Good luck, Will.

577
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,375
Good luck, Captain.

578
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,959
We've just received
an urgent message

579
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,458
from Lursa and B'Etor.

580
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,792
Gowron's forces have
attacked in three sectors.

581
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:15,792
The Duras are
nearing defeat.

582
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,208
You mean they were
caught unprepared

583
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,583
and now,
they're crying for help.

584
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,542
(<i> sighs</i> )
Have the science sections

585
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,792
found a way to circumvent
the detection grid yet?

586
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,583
We think so.

587
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,583
Just before
we cross the border

588
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:35,875
we'll send out a massive
tachyon pulse.

589
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:37,542
A burst that large
should cause

590
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,291
enough interference
to disable

591
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,333
the part of
their network.

592
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,667
Good.

593
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:47,375
MOVAR: One of their ships is
moving off the blockade line.

594
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:48,917
Their warp drive is failing.

595
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,625
Picard is
redeploying the fleet

596
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:53,375
to compensate for
the missing ship.

597
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:55,291
There's a gap
opening in the net.

598
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,458
SELA: He doesn't have enough
ships to maintain the network.

599
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,750
If we act quickly,
we can move through.

600
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,083
Commander?!

601
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:08,083
No.
I don't think so.

602
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,834
But it's what
we've been waiting for!

603
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:12,333
Yes, I know,
and so does Picard.

604
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,625
He's giving us
exactly what we need,

605
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:17,250
and he expects us to take it.

606
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:20,709
No. We won't step
into Picard's trap.

607
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,750
We will disable part
of his network...

608
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:26,625
here, where
they're weakest.

609
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,333
We'll direct
the energy burst

610
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:32,000
right at the ship with
the android captain.

611
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,458
Sir, the detection net

612
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,917
is picking up activity
from the Romulans.

613
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:41,667
15 cloaked ships

614
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,125
spreading out
along the border.

615
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,875
Signal the fleet
to stand by.

616
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:46,375
Aye, sir.

617
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:48,792
Now.

618
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:55,625
Come to course 080,
mark 295.

619
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,125
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

620
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:59,834
There's a disruption
in the tachyon detectors.

621
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:09,375
It's localized to this
segment of the net.

622
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,500
Open a channel to
the<i> Sutherland.</i>

623
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:12,875
Data here, sir.

624
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,166
We're reading
a disruption

625
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,125
of the tachyon net
in your area.

626
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:17,792
DATA: Yes, sir.
The Romulans have released

627
00:34:17,834 --> 00:34:19,291
a high-energy burst.

628
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,083
The net is no longer
effective in a radius

629
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,291
of 10 million kilometers
around the<i> Sutherland.</i>

630
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,083
That's where
they're going through.

631
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,709
Send a signal to the fleet.

632
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,000
All ships to fall back and
rendezvous at Gamma Eridon.

633
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,667
We'll re-establish
the net there.

634
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:33,417
Aye, sir.

635
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:44,250
All Federation ships proceed at
maximum warp to Gamma Eridon.

636
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,792
Acknowledge the signal.
Ensign, lay in a course

637
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,542
and engage at warp 9.3.

638
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,500
Aye, sir.

639
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,917
What are you doing?

640
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,250
In disrupting the
detection net,

641
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:08,041
the Romulans may
have caused a residual

642
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,542
tachyon signature to form
around their own ships.

643
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:13,125
But we have no way
of detecting it.

644
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,375
All stop.

645
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:16,041
Aye, sir. All stop.

646
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:20,458
Sir...

647
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,000
the fleet's been ordered
to Gamma Eridon.

648
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:25,291
The tachyon signatures
will not last long.

649
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,000
By the time the fleet is
deployed, it will be too late.

650
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:29,792
Begin to reconfigure
the sensors

651
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:31,625
to detect ionized
particle traces.

652
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:34,875
The entire area's been flooded
with tachyon particles.

653
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:37,291
We'll never be able to find
what we're looking for.

654
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,917
I am aware of the difficulties.

655
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:40,875
Please bring
the phasers back on-line.

656
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:43,625
That will flood three decks
with radiation.

657
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:46,417
We will initiate radiation
protocol when necessary.

658
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,750
You don't give a damn
about the people whose lives

659
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:50,834
you're throwing away,
we're not just machines--

660
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,625
Mr. Hobson!

661
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:55,750
You will carry out my orders
or I will relieve you of duty.

662
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,583
Yes, sir.

663
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:06,959
Captain, the<i> Sutherland</i> 
isn't heading

664
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,333
for the rendezvous point.

665
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,417
She's come to
a full stop.

666
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,875
Open a channel.

667
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:18,375
The<i> Enterprise</i> wants to know
the reason we've stopped.

668
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:20,375
Display sensor schematic.

669
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:27,125
Display sensor sweep,
maximum range.

670
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,667
Are you going to answer
the<i> Enterprise?</i>

671
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:33,041
Overlay display
with tachyon emissions.

672
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,792
Highlight any tachyon
signatures

673
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:42,458
which show subspace
inertial displacement.

674
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,834
Concentrate a sensor sweep
in that area.

675
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:46,542
HOBSON:
Sir, this is pointless.

676
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,875
Those readings
could be anything.

677
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,500
There's no way for us
to be sure

678
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,834
the Romulans
are out there.

679
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:54,375
Reconfigure photon
torpedo warhead yields.

680
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:56,792
Set for high energy burst,
level six.

681
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:58,417
Level six?
But that won't even--

682
00:36:58,458 --> 00:36:59,750
Do it!

683
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,917
Torpedoes ready.

684
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:08,959
Another message coming in.
It's Captain Picard.

685
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,875
PICARD: Mr. Data,
you were ordered to rendezvous

686
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:15,291
with the fleet at Gamma Eridon.
Acknowledge.

687
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,834
Stand by, Captain.

688
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,166
Mr. Hobson, prepare to fire.

689
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,250
Didn't you hear?
Captain Picard wants us--

690
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:21,542
Fire.

691
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,542
Fire!

692
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:39,417
They have
discovered us.

693
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:40,667
Reverse course.

694
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:42,500
Order the fleet back
to Romulan territory.

695
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:45,417
Commander, the Duras
need this convoy.

696
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,375
Without these supplies,
they cannot win.

697
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:49,083
We've been discovered.
It's over.

698
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:52,083
But what should I tell
Lursa and B'Etor?

699
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,667
Tell them...

700
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:58,250
they're on their own.

701
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:09,750
They're changing course,
heading back to Romulan space.

702
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,917
Make a full report
to the flagship.

703
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,250
Take the main
phasers off-line

704
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,792
and begin radiation cleanup
of the affected decks.

705
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:19,417
Yes, sir...

706
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:21,458
Captain.

707
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Defeat.

708
00:38:36,542 --> 00:38:38,291
How? Where are
the Romulans?

709
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,667
They never came.

710
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:42,458
(<i> Worf groans</i> )

711
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,750
(<i> spits</i> )

712
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:50,041
Kill him.

713
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,500
(<i> explosion</i> )

714
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:09,000
No!

715
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,083
(<i> grunts</i> )

716
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:34,834
Toral...

717
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:38,125
the next leader
of the empire.

718
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:42,000
Gowron is looking forward
to seeing you again.

719
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:50,083
<i>Captain's personal Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45025.4.</i>

720
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,375
<i>It is with a profound</i>
<i>sense of relief</i>

721
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:55,625
<i>that I have ordered the fleet</i>
<i>back to Federation territory</i>

722
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,500
<i>following</i>
<i>the Romulan withdrawal</i>

723
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,709
<i>and the news of Gowron's</i>
<i>victory.</i>

724
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,917
<i>We have arrived</i>
<i>at the Klingon home world</i>

725
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:03,792
<i>where I will present</i>
<i>the High Council</i>

726
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,291
<i>with a full report on our</i>
<i>encounter with the Romulans.</i>

727
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

728
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:10,417
Come.

729
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:15,208
Captain, I wish
to submit myself

730
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,667
for disciplinary action.

731
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:18,458
I have disobeyed
a direct order

732
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,208
from a superior officer.

733
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,000
Although the result of
my actions proved positive,

734
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:25,417
the ends cannot justify
the means.

735
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:30,542
No, they can't.

736
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:35,000
However, the claim
"I was only following orders"

737
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:39,709
has been used to justify too
many tragedies in our history.

738
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,166
Starfleet doesn't want officers
who will blindly follow orders

739
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,125
without analyzing the situation.

740
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:48,333
Your actions were appropriate
for the circumstances,

741
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,917
and I have noted
that in your record.

742
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:55,083
Mr. Data?

743
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,750
Nicely done.

744
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:01,583
Sir.

745
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,625
The Council appreciates
your report, Captain.

746
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:21,917
The information
on the Romulan supply ships

747
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:24,792
will prove very useful.

748
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:28,291
Before you leave...

749
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:32,000
there is one last matter
to attend to.

750
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:48,750
Bring him.

751
00:41:57,083 --> 00:42:00,917
Toral, son of Duras.

752
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:03,625
You stand convicted of treason.

753
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:07,667
The Duras family will one day
rule the empire.

754
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:10,000
Perhaps...

755
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,834
but not today.

756
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:18,417
Worf...

757
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:21,375
this child's family

758
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:25,000
wrongly took your name

759
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:27,542
and your honor
from you.

760
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:32,625
In return...

761
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:38,041
I give his life...
to you.

762
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:12,875
(<i> drops knife</i> )

763
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,375
What's wrong?

764
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:24,083
Kill him!

765
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:26,792
No.

766
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:28,750
But it's our way.

767
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:31,208
It's the Klingon way.

768
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,291
I know...

769
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,834
but it is not my way.

770
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:44,458
This boy has
done me no harm,

771
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,208
and I will not kill him for
the crimes of his family.

772
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,917
Then it falls to Kurn.

773
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:53,792
No!

774
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:55,667
No, you gave
me his life,

775
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:58,333
and I have spared it.

776
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:02,458
As you wish.

777
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:15,333
Request permission
to return to duty, sir.

778
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,333
Granted.
