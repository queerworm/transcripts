1
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,000
Good evening, Mr. Data.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,375
Actually,
good morning, sir.

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,041
Ship status is--
No need to report.

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,375
I'm just here to do
some work on my own.

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:16,583
Aye, sir.

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,959
I'd like to speak
to Professor Mowray

7
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,834
at his archaeological
site on Landris II.

8
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:21,500
Could you put it through
to my ready room?

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,542
I am sorry, sir, but stellar
cartography has requested

10
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:26,125
a communications blackout
while they run an experiment.

11
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,667
Hmm. How long
will it be?

12
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:30,875
Another three hours,
22 minutes, sir.

13
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,125
I can override,
if necessary.

14
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,375
No, it's not important.

15
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,875
Aye, sir.

16
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,333
Computer,
display the latest

17
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,333
excavation schematics
on Landris II.

18
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,542
Library computer
is temporarily off-line.

19
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:54,792
Explain.

20
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:57,083
Library systems
have been allocated

21
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,375
to stellar cartography.

22
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,542
(<i> sighs</i> )

23
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,375
Tea, Earl Grey.
Hot.

24
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,417
COMPUTER:
Replicator systems
are off-line

25
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:16,583
at the request of...

26
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,667
BOTH:
stellar cartography.

27
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:28,583
What could they possibly
be doing down there?

28
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:40,083
Oh...

29
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,625
In or out-- just
close that door.

30
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,417
And don't move.

31
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:51,333
It'll take a second
for our eyes to readjust.

32
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,250
Okay.
Elevate to 3.2, Marquez.

33
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,667
MARQUEZ:
Now at 3.2, Commander.

34
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:58,291
Good. Good.
We can do this.

35
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,250
No, no, no. We're losing
vertical alignment.

36
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,083
Compensate. Compensate!

37
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,333
Compensating.

38
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,709
Gently. Gently, Marquez.
Don't bump it.

39
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,417
(<i> buzzing</i> )

40
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:10,500
No! No, no, hit the--

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,542
Oh... oh, forget it.

42
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:15,917
Forget it.
Lights.

43
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,500
Whoever you are,
you just ruined

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,125
four hours of work.

45
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,500
You might have taken
the simple precaution

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,667
of locking the door.

47
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,291
It's 3:00
in the morning...

48
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,709
Captain Picard.

49
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,709
I assume that you must be
Lieutenant Commander Daren.

50
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,250
Yes, sir.

51
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,500
I'm sorry. It's just we
weren't expecting anybody

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,166
to be up at this hour.

53
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,625
Well, you're new
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

54
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,583
You'll have to learn
to expect the unexpected.

55
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,542
That's why I put in for
this assignment, sir.

56
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:47,375
Excellent. Now, perhaps
you can tell me

57
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,041
what was so important
that it required

58
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,542
depriving the captain
of his cup of Earl Grey.

59
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:55,041
Earl Grey? No wonder
you can't sleep.

60
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,917
Computer, bring replicators
back online

61
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:58,917
and give me a cup
of Daren herbal tea

62
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:01,208
blend number three,
hot.

63
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,792
You shouldn't be
drinking a stimulant

64
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:09,500
at this time of night.

65
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,291
I think
you'll like this.

66
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,917
I-- I've programmed
seven other blends

67
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:21,750
into the replicator.

68
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,250
You're bound to
like one of them.

69
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,542
I look forward
to sampling them.

70
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:27,250
(<i> coughing</i> )

71
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,583
(<i> chuckling</i> )

72
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,834
I'm sorry if, uh,
the system blackouts

73
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:34,375
we requested...
inconvenienced you.

74
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,417
We're taking very precise
gravimetric readings,

75
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,375
so it wouldn't have taken
much to throw them off.

76
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,125
What were
the readings for?

77
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,750
Well, I'm trying to construct
a mathematical model

78
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,625
of an emerging
star system.

79
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,375
If it works, we'll
be able to predict

80
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,000
the configuration
of a star system

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,166
that won't be formed for
another two million years.

82
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,834
A long time to wait
to see if you're right.

83
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,792
I have a few things to do
between now and then.

84
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:31,583
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

85
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:35,834
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

86
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:37,417
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

87
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:41,166
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

88
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:45,792
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

89
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:49,750
<i>to boldly go where</i>
<i>no one has gone before.</i>

90
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,208
Captain, we'll be arriving

91
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,542
at the Borgolis Nebula
in three hours.

92
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:56,875
Yes, I understand

93
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,417
that it has some unusual
radioactive emissions.

94
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:01,959
Well, I'm sure that
stellar sciences

95
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,667
will find it a most
interesting study.

96
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,917
Commander Daren has already
requested extra time

97
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:07,917
on the main
sensor array.

98
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,542
Well, you have the
bridge, Number One.

99
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,000
Captain?

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,417
I would like
to remind you

101
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,291
of our concert this
evening in Ten Forward.

102
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,041
We will perform Chopin's
"Trio in G Minor."

103
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,917
I'll be there.

104
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,709
PICARD:
And so, the upshot is,

105
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:29,000
that we'll be close enough
for you to slip away

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,375
for a few days
and see Wesley.

107
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,792
Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you, Jean-Luc.

108
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,583
This is delicious.
What is it?

109
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,834
Mmm, it's
a herbal tea blend.

110
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:40,709
I, um... found it
in the replicator files.

111
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,417
Oh.

112
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,917
Have you met any
of the new crew members

113
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,166
who came aboard
at Starbase 218?

114
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,166
In fact, I have
a new nurse-- Beck.

115
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,458
He's an obstetrics
specialist.

116
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:54,250
I met the new head
of stellar sciences last night--

117
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,250
Lieutenant Commander Daren.

118
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,625
Yes...
Nella Daren.

119
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,709
She came into sick bay
for a physical last week.

120
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,917
I like her--
very forthright.

121
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:06,125
Did you know...

122
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,542
that it is now possible

123
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:11,041
to predict the configuration
of a star system

124
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,375
which won't be formed
for another two million years?

125
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,166
Really?
No, I didn't.

126
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,375
Mm-hmm. It's really
quite intriguing.

127
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,000
The whole thing
is made possible

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,792
by a complex
mathematical construct

129
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:24,125
based on fractal
particle motion.

130
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,750
But that's only
the foundation.

131
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,792
The modeling itself is done
by gravimetric wave input.

132
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,417
I see.
Hmm.

133
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,208
Well...

134
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,291
I know this is all
pretty dry stuff.

135
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,166
Stellar cartography
isn't everybody's cup of tea.

136
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,166
I'm sure it's really
quite fascinating.

137
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,583
You know, we should be
getting along to Ten Forward.

138
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,291
We're going to be late
for the concert.

139
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:59,250
(<i> audience murmuring</i> )

140
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:10,125
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

141
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,250
(<i> playing Chopin's</i>
<i>"Trio in G Minor"</i> )

142
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,208
Thank you.
DAREN: Thank you.

143
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,542
Will you
excuse me?

144
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,667
Yes,
of course.

145
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,667
Well done, Mr. Data.
Well done.

146
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,333
Commander, that was
a remarkable performance.

147
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,625
You are very talented.
Thank you.

148
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,291
I noticed that the
applause this evening

149
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,417
exceeded average
decibel levels.

150
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,125
I guess that means
they enjoyed themselves.

151
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,583
I think that much
was obvious.

152
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,834
Excuse me.
I have not yet

153
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:53,125
congratulated
Ensign Cheney.

154
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,917
I'll go with you.

155
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:57,041
Commander, you must have been
playing since you were young.

156
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,041
I played the piano
for a while when I was small,

157
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,667
but I didn't put in
the practice you must have.

158
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,417
Well, practicing was
never my problem.

159
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:07,250
In fact, my parents had to
make me go out and play.

160
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,875
I wanted to ask,
uh...

161
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,792
during the second arpeggio
of the first movement,

162
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,125
I noticed that you played

163
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,458
an F minor chord
instead of a diminished D.

164
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,166
You're a musician.
What's your instrument?

165
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,417
We should play sometime.

166
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,083
No, no, no.
I'm-I'm just an amateur.

167
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,750
But your choice in that
arpeggio was delightful.

168
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,250
Not at all
what one would expect.

169
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,834
Well, Captain,
now that I'm on your ship,

170
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:30,083
maybe you should start
expecting the unexpected.

171
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:43,458
Ah.
Excuse me, sir.

172
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,875
I was hoping that my people
in spectral analysis

173
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,333
could have another few hours
on the main sensor array?

174
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,834
I'm sorry.
The array has already

175
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,125
been allocated
to engineering.

176
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,417
They're running

00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,375
I know there are
no Starfleet regulations

356
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,834
about a captain
becoming involved

357
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:45,625
with a fellow officer.

358
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,458
But--
You would like my opinion

359
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,417
about you and
Commander Daren?

360
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,542
It's that obvious?

361
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,959
In a way
that pleases people

362
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,542
who care about your happiness,
yes, it is.

363
00:22:58,542 --> 00:22:59,709
But I have to
be concerned

364
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,875
about more
than my own happiness.

365
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,417
And you think that
your feelings toward Nella

366
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:06,959
could change the way
you function as captain?

367
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,166
Yes.

368
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,709
Relationships
with coworkers

369
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:11,875
can be fraught
with consequences.

370
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,542
That's true,

371
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,333
but cutting yourself off
from your feelings

372
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,500
can carry consequences

373
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,542
that are just
as serious.

374
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:25,041
You see, I've
always believed

375
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,417
that becoming involved with
someone under my command

376
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,667
would compromise
my objectivity.

377
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,792
And yet...

378
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:36,417
Captain, are you asking
my permission?

379
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:38,333
If I were,
would you give it?

380
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:42,750
Yes.

381
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:44,917
(<i> door chimes</i> )

382
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,625
Come in.

383
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,917
Nella?

384
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,458
Can I help you,
sir?

385
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:03,125
(<i> sighs</i> )

386
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,458
I'm really very sorry

387
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,375
about what happened
in the turbolift.

388
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,417
When the crew member
walked in,

389
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,333
I felt very
self-conscious.

390
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,583
It's going to take
a while

391
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,000
for me to get used
to the idea

392
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,709
of crew seeing
the two of us together.

393
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,125
I understand.

394
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,792
Now, I'm glad you told me.
For a minute there,

395
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,834
I thought
I'd misread you.

396
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:25,750
One kiss, and you're off
to find somebody else.

397
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:33,041
I can assure you that I'm not
given to casual relationships.

398
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:39,291
There is something
that I want to tell you...

399
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,291
but not here.

400
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:46,166
Do you remember
the folk melody that
I played to you this morning?

401
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,625
Yes. Yeah.

402
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:51,792
I learned it on a planet
called Kataan.

403
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:53,417
Never heard of it.

404
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,625
No, I'm not surprised.

405
00:24:55,625 --> 00:25:00,083
Its sun went nova more than
a thousand years ago.

406
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,542
I don't understand.

407
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:06,917
The<i> Enterprise</i> 
encountered a probe

408
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:09,291
that had been sent
from the planet

409
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,083
before it was destroyed.

410
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:14,250
And it scanned me,
and I lost consciousness.

411
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,041
And...

412
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:22,083
in the space
of 25 minutes,

413
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:26,875
I lived a lifetime
on that planet.

414
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,583
I had a wife and...

415
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:34,083
and children
and a grandchild.

416
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:39,625
And it was
absolutely real to me.

417
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,250
And when I awoke,

418
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,458
all that I had left
of that life

419
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:49,959
was the flute that
I'd taught myself to play.

420
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,500
Why are you
telling me this?

421
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,792
Because I want you
to understand

422
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:58,125
what my music
means to me...

423
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,291
(<i> sighs</i> )

424
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,333
...and what it
means for me

425
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:06,959
to be able to
share it with someone.

426
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:15,333
Thank you.

427
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,583
Hello.
Sir.

428
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:38,125
Commander, I was
hoping to talk to you

429
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,792
about Ensign Cabot's
transfer.

430
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:41,834
Quantum mechanics doesn't
want to give him up.

431
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,875
But he wants to come
to my department.

432
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:48,375
How do you know that?
I offered it to him.

433
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,041
Transfers are to
be approved by me

434
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,625
before any offers
are made.

435
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:52,667
I'm sorry.

436
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,208
We were just talking,
and...

437
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:56,959
It's all right, but Cabot
should stay where he is.

438
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:59,750
Commander, please don't make
that decision final.

439
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,834
I realize I shouldn't
have made the offer,

440
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:03,792
but he's perfect
for the job,

441
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:06,291
and quantum mechanics
is overstaffed, anyway.

442
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,417
Commander, do you realize the
position you're putting me in?

443
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:11,625
Well, I-I think
I'm just doing

444
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,542
what any good
department head would do--

445
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:16,166
trying to build
the best staff I can.

446
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,750
Look, I'll review
the situation.

447
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,500
I'll let you know
as soon as I can.

448
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,625
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come.

449
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,750
May I have a minute?

450
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,375
Yes, of course.
Come in, Number One.

451
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:37,625
It's about Lieutenant
Commander Daren.

452
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,542
As a department head,
she comes to me

453
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:42,333
for systems allocation,
personnel transfers,

454
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,917
things like that.

455
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:46,208
Well...
I'm beginning to feel

456
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,291
uncomfortable
with her requests.

457
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:54,333
Because of her
relationship with me?

458
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,291
Yes, sir.

459
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:07,542
Are her requests unusual?
No.

460
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:10,291
Would you say that she's
just trying to do her job?

461
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,000
Yes, sir.

462
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,208
Then let her do it, and you
feel free to do yours.

463
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:18,250
Ship's resources are
your responsibility.

464
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,125
I have always had absolute
confidence in your judgment.

465
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,709
Thank you, sir.

466
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,917
(<i> sighs</i> )

467
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,625
I can't believe I'm going
to get the chance to study

468
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,709
the firestorms
on Bersallis.

469
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:42,250
Apparently,
they're generated

470
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,458
by particle emissions
from the Bersallin sun.

471
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:47,500
They cause a cascade effect
in the planet's atmosphere

472
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,959
that...

473
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,834
Oh, I'm boring you.

474
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:53,208
No. No. No, you're not.

475
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,458
Not at all.

476
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:57,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

477
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:59,041
It's just that...

478
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:02,208
Commander Riker
came to see me this afternoon...

479
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,542
about you.

480
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,709
About the personnel
transfer.

481
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:10,667
I<i> thought</i> 
he looked uncomfortable.

482
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,333
He thought I was asking
for special treatment.

483
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,083
I was just doing what I thought
was best for my department.

484
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,000
And that's what I told him.

485
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,625
But...
we have to be careful.

486
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:27,750
Obviously, it's easy
for people to misunderstand.

487
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,166
I don't like the thought

488
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:32,333
of having to second-guess
people all the time.

489
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,959
If I have to worry about what
people are thinking about me,

490
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,083
I'll be concentrating
on the wrong thing

491
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,709
and I won't be
as effective an officer.

492
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:40,583
All I'm saying is

493
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,458
that it's something
we have to be aware of,

494
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:44,709
but you mustn't
compromise yourself.

495
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:46,834
You must do
what you have to do,

496
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:49,959
because if I find that
my head of stellar sciences

497
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:53,417
isn't being effective,
then<i> I</i> shall do what<i> I</i> must do--

498
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,333
and I shall replace her.

499
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,875
Noted, sir.

500
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,583
Now, I think that we should
just forget about this

501
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,000
and enjoy our evening.

502
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,875
What about that special
dessert you promised me?

503
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:09,500
Right. Now, this is something
that I first tasted

504
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,709
on Thelka IV...

505
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,000
WORF:
Bridge to Captain.

506
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,417
Go ahead, Mr. Worf.

507
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:15,083
WORF:
Bersallis III reports

508
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:17,542
that the storm has changed
its speed and heading.

509
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,667
They are predicting
it will hit the outpost

510
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:23,417
within eight hours
and are requesting evacuation.

511
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,375
I'm on my way.

512
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:35,125
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46693.1:</i>

513
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,542
<i>We have entered</i>
<i>the Bersallis star system</i>

514
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:39,750
<i>and are making</i>
<i>preparations to evacuate</i>

515
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,291
<i>the Federation outpost</i>
<i>on the third planet.</i>

516
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:43,750
A firestorm can
kick up winds

517
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,750
of over 200
kilometers per hour

518
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,083
and temperatures
as high as 300 degrees C.

519
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,834
Incredible.
What causes them?

520
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:53,041
They form when
solar flare radiation

521
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:54,417
reacts with
high-energy plasma

522
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:56,208
present in
the planet's atmosphere.

523
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:59,333
Wasn't the outpost constructed
to<i> withstand</i> the conditions?

524
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,750
It was-- both reinforced
and insulated.

525
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,375
But this is
no ordinary storm.

526
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,959
It's twice as strong
as anything they've ever seen.

527
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,709
The outpost just
won't withstand it.

528
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,750
We'll arrive about an hour
before the storm gets there,

529
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,417
and it'll take us
at least two hours

530
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:14,041
to evacuate the colonists
off the surface.

531
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,750
I led a team of geologists

532
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,125
to study the plasma geyser
on Melnos IV.

533
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:21,125
Now, we cross-connected
a few thermal deflector units

534
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:23,333
to create a protective shield
against the heat.

535
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,709
A firewall.

536
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:27,000
Mm-hmm. Would something
like that work here?

537
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,792
You know... it might.

538
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:34,458
The storm is approaching the
outpost from this direction.

539
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:38,917
If we were to set up a series
of thermal deflector units

540
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:41,542
along the northern perimeter,
we could create a firewall

541
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:43,375
and deflect
some of the heat.

542
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:44,750
The insulation
from the outpost

543
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,041
should be able
to handle the rest.

544
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:47,792
Thermal deflectors
generate a field

545
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:50,083
approximately
400 meters wide.

546
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:52,333
We would need to
cross-connect six units

547
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,458
and align them so that
the fields overlap.

548
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,834
How many people would
it take to set that up?

549
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,667
Twelve-- two per team.

550
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,000
Cross-connecting that many
units, it'll be a little tricky.

551
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,583
Once they're set up, we'll have
to leave the units in place

552
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,041
and transport our people out.

553
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,667
Nobody would be able
to survive

554
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:09,417
very long outside
that structure.

555
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:12,542
Let's do it.

556
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:14,458
The storm is going to
interfere with communication.

557
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:16,667
Everything will need to be
coordinated from the surface.

558
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:19,125
Mr. Data, you will coordinate
the evacuation of the colonists.

559
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,458
Doctor, there are nine patients
in the outpost infirmary.

560
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:23,500
Your first priority will be
to get them to Sick Bay.

561
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,417
After that, you will stay
on board the<i> Enterprise.</i>

562
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:27,166
Be ready to receive
casualties.

563
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,959
Marquez, you'll take some people
down and track the storm.

564
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,333
All the other teams will need to
be kept apprised of its heading.

565
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:35,291
Commander, you'll be in charge
of deploying the deflectors.

566
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,333
Let's go.

567
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,208
Commander Daren?

568
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,083
About those
thermal deflectors.

569
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,625
There must be one
of any number of people

570
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,291
that coordinate
their deployment.

571
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:54,709
I assume Commander
Riker chose me

572
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:57,583
because I'm the best
person for the job.

573
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:59,834
Didn't we agree not
to let our relationship

574
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:02,041
get in the way
of our work?

575
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:07,375
I'll be all right.

576
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:30,250
Lieutenant Marquez is already
set up on the surface.

577
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,208
Apparently, the storm
is gaining speed.

578
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,792
He's estimating
it'll hit the colony

579
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:35,542
in less than
50 minutes.

580
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:37,667
Ensign, make sure you maintain
a continuous transporter lock

581
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,375
on all away team
personnel.

582
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:41,208
We may have to pull
them out in a hurry.
ENSIGN: Aye, sir.

583
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:43,834
RIKER: I don't want to take any
unnecessary chances down there.

584
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:46,166
If anyone gets into trouble
beam them up immediately.

585
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,250
Energize.

586
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,208
Mr. Worf, how long until
the storm reaches the outpost?

587
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:09,834
17 minutes.

588
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:13,250
La Forge to Bridge.
Go ahead, Mr. La forge.

589
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,333
The ionization from
the storm is interfering

590
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,083
with the transporters,
Captain.

591
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:20,083
I'm compensating, but it's
slowing things down a bit.

592
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,792
PICARD:
Keep at it, Mr. La Forge.

593
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:39,625
RIKER:
Riker to Daren.

594
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,458
Daren here.
Go ahead, Commander.

595
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:43,458
RIKER: You've got less than
nine minutes before the storm

596
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,542
reaches
the northern perimeter.

597
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,041
I'm here with team six.

598
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:49,000
We're just about to bring
the deflectors online.

599
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
RIKER:
Whenever you're ready.

600
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,291
Daren to perimeter teams.

601
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,542
Stand by to
cross-connect deflectors.

602
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:58,041
MAN: Standing by.
Activate.

603
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:08,709
Team three, increase your
output by point two percent.

604
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:11,250
WOMAN: Yes, sir.
Good, good.

605
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:16,333
Deng, decrease nutation
by point four percent.

606
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:20,375
Good.
We've almost got it.

607
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,041
Crusher to Bridge.
Go ahead, Doctor.

608
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,125
We just brought back the last
of the infirmary patients

609
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,709
and they're on
their way to Sick Bay,

610
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:35,208
but we still have over
100 colonists down there.

611
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:37,458
Understood.

612
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:40,875
Daren to Commander Riker.
Riker here. Go ahead.

613
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,667
DAREN:
We've got a problem.

614
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:45,542
We're having trouble keeping
the deflectors cross-connected.

615
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:47,000
So, the only way
this is going to work

616
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,041
is if we calibrate
them manually.

617
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,542
RIKER:
If you stay with the deflectors,

618
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:52,333
will they protect you
when the storm hits?

619
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:55,291
DAREN:
I don't know, sir.

620
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,083
A few minutes maybe.

621
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,041
(<i> static hissing</i> )

622
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,959
Picard to Commander Riker.

623
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:05,125
How many more colonists
do you have to transport?
73, sir.

624
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:08,208
How long do you need?
At least ten more minutes.

625
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,875
Captain,
the storm will reach

626
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,875
the northern perimeter
in four minutes.

627
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,709
Picard to perimeter teams.

628
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:26,166
It is imperative
that you hold your position

629
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:29,417
until we've finished
evacuating the colony.

630
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:31,417
Picard out.

631
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,250
Picard to Mr. La Forge.
La Forge here.

632
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,333
I want a signal lock

633
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,041
on every member
of the perimeter teams.

634
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:42,750
LA FORGE: Captain, the storm's
interference won't...

635
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,917
As soon as the last
of the colony is evacuated,

636
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:46,500
I want those
perimeter teams out of there.

637
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,875
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.

638
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,041
(<i> electrical zapping</i> )

639
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,792
(<i> wind howling</i> )

640
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,208
Daren to perimeter teams.

641
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:56,959
The storm's interference

642
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:59,458
is going to make our job
harder than we thought.

643
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,208
We may lose communication,

644
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:04,750
so it's up to each of you to
keep your units operational.

645
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:10,041
A lot of people
are depending on us.

646
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,083
Daren out.

647
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,959
Oh, my God.

648
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:29,792
(<i> wind roaring</i> )

649
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:35,667
The storm has reached
the perimeter.

650
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,542
(<i> murmuring voices</i> )

651
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:57,000
I got out with
the last of the colonists.

652
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,083
If it hadn't been
for the perimeter teams,

653
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,125
none of us would
have made it.

654
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,125
We were able to clear
out four of the teams

655
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:06,208
and the interference prevented
us from getting two more.

656
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,709
I don't know how
they could have survived.

657
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:15,083
Which teams are missing?

658
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,959
Three and six.

659
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:21,542
The last I knew,
Commander Daren
was on team six.

660
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:10,583
WORF:
Bridge to Captain.

661
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,333
Go ahead, Mr. Worf.

662
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,250
WORF:
We have found survivors, sir.

663
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,291
They are beaming up now.

664
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:20,917
I'm on my way.

665
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:23,458
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

666
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,041
(<i> whoosh of</i>
<i>active transport</i> )

667
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:53,834
That's it.

668
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,458
Here, let me help you.
Thank you.

669
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,959
Here, just give
me your hands.

670
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:02,500
You're going to be fine.

671
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:10,125
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46697.2:</i>

672
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,792
<i>Although we succeeded</i>
<i>in rescuing</i>

673
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,458
<i>all 643 Bersallin colonists,</i>

674
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,625
<i>we lost eight crew members.</i>

676
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,291
<i>in the performance</i>
<i>of their duty.</i>

677
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:23,417
When communications
went out,

678
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:26,000
I knew we had to fend
for ourselves.

679
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,959
We modified our phasers
to create resonant disruptions

680
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,417
in the deflector field.

681
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:32,125
The disruptions
formed small pockets

682
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,959
in the plane
of the field

683
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:38,375
and we each stood inside one
to wait out the storm.

684
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:41,333
Richardson
didn't make it.

685
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:45,041
All Deng and I could do
was stand there...

686
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:47,083
and watch.

687
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,375
I'm so sorry.

688
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,375
Don't, don't say
you're sorry.

689
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,875
It must have been terrible.

690
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:05,333
At first, when you told us
to hold our positions,

691
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,000
I didn't question it.

692
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,375
Of course we would.

693
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:10,458
That was our job.

694
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:15,125
But when I saw that storm
coming toward us...

695
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:20,542
A part of you
must have blamed me.

696
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:23,792
A small part, maybe.

697
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,083
But, in the end,
I was more afraid

698
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,750
that you'd blame yourself
if I died.

699
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Would you have?

700
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,166
I've lost people
under my command...

701
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:45,542
people who were
very dear to me...

702
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:50,000
but never...

703
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,917
someone I've been
in love with.

704
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:56,417
And when I believed
that you were dead,

705
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:58,166
I just began to shut down.

706
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:01,458
I didn't want
to think or feel.

707
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:03,917
I was here in my quarters...

708
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,750
and the only thing I could
focus on was my music

709
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,583
and how it would never again
give me any joy.

710
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:19,875
And then I saw you standing
on the transporter pad.

711
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,792
And I knew that I could

712
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,583
never again put
your life in jeopardy.

713
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,458
If I stayed here...

714
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:37,083
you might have to.

715
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:40,208
You could always resign
your commission.

716
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:41,750
Stay here with me.

717
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,000
And you could
resign yours

718
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,667
and come to
a starbase with me.

719
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:51,000
(<i> chuckles</i> )

720
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,458
I'll apply...

721
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,542
for a transfer.

722
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,333
But we could
still see each other.

723
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,875
People do.

724
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:14,000
We could arrange
shore leave together.

725
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,917
And, for the future...
who knows?

726
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:19,709
Of course.

727
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,417
Promise me something.

728
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:38,125
Don't give up your music.
