1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,125
RIKER:
Geordi, have you found it yet?

2
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:06,625
Not yet.

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,709
(<i> loud hissing</i> )

4
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,917
I'm starting
to get some fumes!

5
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:16,125
Ammonia... chlorine,

6
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,917
potassium chloride.

7
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:31,875
(<i> coughing</i> )

8
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:42,291
Oh, I can feel
the heat from here.

9
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,834
There it is.

10
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:49,625
RIKER:
How far?

11
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,375
About ten meters
up the ODN line.

12
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,375
Boy, it's hot.

13
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,083
I'd say over 2,000 degrees.

14
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,500
I'm going in.

15
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,375
(<i> loud rumbling</i> )

16
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,750
(<i> clanking</i> )

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,291
(<i> beeping</i> )

18
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,458
(<i> hissing</i> )

19
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,625
We're okay.

20
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,125
I've activated the emergency
suppression system.

21
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,834
DR. CRUSHER:
All his vital functions
are completely normal.

22
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:36,333
The interface unit is operating
within expected parameters.

23
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,166
Why did he start coughing
when he went through the gases?

24
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,500
DR. CRUSHER:
Psychosomatic response.

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,041
I feel like
I'm actually here...

26
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:46,542
I mean, there--
in the Jefferies tube.

27
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:48,166
It's funny--
when I saw the smoke,

28
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,875
I couldn't help but cough.

29
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:53,417
No one has ever reported so
complete a sensory experience.

30
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,458
The interface is
perfect for Geordi

31
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,709
because his visor inputs
allow the probe

32
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:00,834
to transmit information directly
into his cerebral cortex.

33
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:03,250
It looks like this
is going to work.

34
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,333
Geordi, I'd like
to get the probe

35
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,750
out of the Jefferies tube
onto the Launch Bay

36
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,959
before we reach
Marijne VII.

37
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,917
Will do.

38
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:15,166
Wait a minute.

39
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,000
Something's wrong.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,792
I can't get
my left leg to work.

41
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,000
What is it?

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,291
The probe is designed
to respond

43
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,667
to any movement
Geordi intends to make.

44
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,166
When his brain sends
a message to move his leg,

45
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,417
the interface should move
the probe instead.

46
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,917
Apparently, the tactile
sensors are too low.

47
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:36,875
I will increase
the input.

48
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,875
There it goes.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm on my way down.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,750
Why the bodysuit?

51
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,417
It provides tactile sensations
so that Geordi can feel

52
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,667
he's in the same
environment as the probe.

53
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,250
Geordi,
what's wrong?

54
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:03,834
Nothing.

55
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,792
I'm seeing my reflection
in a panel.

56
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:10,458
I forgot what
a handsome guy I am.

57
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:44,917
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

58
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:48,959
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

59
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,875
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

60
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,792
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

61
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:59,250
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

62
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,333
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

63
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:05,542
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47215.5:</i>

64
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,709
<i>We are responding</i>
<i>to a distress call</i>

65
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:10,959
<i>from the science vessel</i> Raman,
<i>which is apparently trapped</i>

66
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,041
<i>inside the turbulent atmosphere</i>
<i>of an unusual gas giant planet.</i>

67
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,625
<i>We will use an experimental</i>
<i>interface probe</i>

68
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,166
<i>in our attempt</i>
<i>to rescue it.</i>

69
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,625
I have reviewed
the vessel's mission plans.

70
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,625
The<i> Raman</i> was to descend
to the lower atmosphere

71
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,959
11,000 kilometers below
its current position.

72
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,625
The crew was to sample
the atmosphere at that level

73
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,125
and then return
to a safer orbit.

74
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,250
Something must have
happened down there.

75
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,417
Maybe the shields failed
or they had some kind of

76
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,875
inversion reaction
in the nacelles.

77
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,166
Any life signs?

78
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,792
LA FORGE:
Our biosensors are useless.

79
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,583
There's too much interference
in the atmosphere.

80
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,917
Their crew might
still be alive.

81
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:46,875
There's no way we can
tell from up here.

82
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,000
Will the probe be able
to transmit through
that interference?

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,208
The probe sends information
via a focused particle beam.

84
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,208
It should be able to cut
through the interference.

85
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,583
But we may have
to operate the probe

86
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,875
at close to tolerance levels.

87
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,333
Hmm.

88
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,333
Will your nervous system
be able to handle

89
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,583
that much sensory input?

90
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,333
We've already tested
the interface

91
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,834
at about 70% of tolerance.

92
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,583
We shouldn't have
any trouble going higher.

93
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,875
The safety override will
kick in at about 98% tolerance

94
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,542
and that will disengage
the interface.

95
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,709
WORF:
Captain, I am receiving
a transmission

96
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,125
from Starfleet Command--
Admiral Holt.

97
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,834
In my Ready Room.

98
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:22,166
The seven people on that ship
are our first priority.

99
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,917
Is the probe ready
for launch?
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,500
Send it directly
to the aft section

101
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,542
of the<i> Raman</i> through
the secondary airlock.

102
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:30,834
That way it should put it
just one bulkhead away
from the Bridge.

103
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,750
I'll interface
with the probe

104
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,125
as soon as it's ready

105
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,667
and take it the rest
of the way from there.

106
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,667
Make it so.

107
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,834
Hello, Marcus.

108
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,458
Jean-Luc.

109
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,166
How's life on DS3?

110
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,333
We're hosting
this year's palio.

111
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,458
The, uh, Ferengi have already
been accused of trying

112
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,542
to bribe the Breen pilot
into throwing the race.

113
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,208
(<i> chuckles softly</i> )

114
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, there's nothing
unusual about that.

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,709
Nothing at all.

116
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,959
I wish I could say
that I was calling

117
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,917
just to catch up on things.

118
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,583
Nine days ago,

119
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,750
the<i> Hera</i> left here
on a routine courier mission.

120
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,250
We were in contact with it
for five of those days.

121
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,542
Then the ship disappeared
without a trace.

122
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,625
The<i> Hera?</i> 
I'm afraid so.

123
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,750
The<i> Excelsior</i> and the<i> Noble</i> 
have been retracing its course

124
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,667
for the last 72 hours.

125
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,291
Nothing.

126
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,417
I'm going to keep them
at it for another 72,

127
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,166
but to be honest,

128
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,709
I don't think another week
would make any difference.

129
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:47,291
I'll inform
Commander La Forge.

130
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

131
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,166
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

132
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,542
Mr. Data, I'd like a word
with Commander La Forge.

133
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:00,041
Aye, sir.

134
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,542
I will be on the Bridge.

135
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,458
Geordi, I've just
spoken with Starfleet.

136
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,083
The<i> Hera</i> is missing.

137
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,125
Missing?

138
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:20,583
My mother?

139
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,667
Captain La Forge
has disappeared

140
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,625
along with the rest
of her crew.

141
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,875
WOMAN:
I saw your father last week,

142
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,667
and your sister about
ten days before that.

143
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,709
I decided I missed
my favorite son.

144
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,583
Your only son, Ma.

145
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,041
You're going to have
to see the<i> Hera</i> again.

146
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,166
We have a lot of
new faces on board,

147
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,583
including a chief engineer
who juices up the nacelles

148
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,583
every chance she gets.

149
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,542
I think she's the best
technician in the fleet.

150
00:08:57,542 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay, second best.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,083
(<i> door chimes</i> )

152
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,125
Come in.

153
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,500
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were...

154
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't worry about it.

155
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,250
Maybe you should meet her.

156
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,500
We're going to be
in the same sector next week.

157
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,250
Take a shuttle over
and I'll introduce you.

158
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,417
My mother's always trying
to find me a wife.

159
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:29,917
MRS. LA FORGE:
...I'll see you at your
father's birthday party.

160
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:32,000
Remember,
if you talk to him,

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,291
it's a surprise.

162
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,792
This came in
about three weeks ago.

163
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,458
I never got back to her.

164
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,417
Geordi, the probe has entered
the planet's atmosphere

165
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:57,583
and I'm ready to take it
onto the ship.

166
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,542
If you would like to take
a couple of days off,

167
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:00,834
I'll run the interface.

168
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,417
The interface is calibrated

169
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,333
specifically to
my visor's inputs.

170
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,834
It would take you at least
ten hours to convert it

171
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,417
and those crewmen
down there can't wait.

172
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,625
The interface doesn't have
to be fully compatible.

173
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,041
I could run it right now.

174
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,917
I wouldn't have the same
control that you have,

175
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,667
but it would still work.

176
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,750
Forget it.

177
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,583
I'm the best person
for the job

178
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,417
and there's no reason why
we shouldn't proceed as planned.

179
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:25,542
The<i> Hera</i> is reason enough.
The<i> Hera</i> is missing,
that's all.

180
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,000
Until I hear
something different,

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,333
my mother just might as well
have taken the crew

182
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,166
on an unscheduled holiday.

183
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,125
Let's go.

184
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,542
Captain, the probe
is through the airlock

185
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,500
and in position
aboard the<i> Raman.</i>

186
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,959
Picard to Commander Data,
report.

187
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,333
We are ready to bring
the interface online, sir.

188
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,166
PICARD:
Proceed.

189
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,333
Activating
the remote sensors.

190
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,667
Initiating interface... now.

191
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,333
Vital signs are normal.

192
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,041
Geordi, how do you feel?

193
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,375
Fine.

194
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,083
DATA:
Do you have visual contact?

195
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,875
Not yet.

196
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,875
Data, turn up
the input sensors.

197
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,542
I'm not seeing anything.

198
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,583
DATA:
Acknowledged.

199
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,709
Okay, I can see,
but no colors.

200
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,458
Increasing signal strength
to 75% of tolerance.

201
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,917
Ah... that's better.

202
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,834
DR. CRUSHER:
Your pulse has gone up.

203
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,917
Your nervous system probably has
to get used to the input levels.

204
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:35,208
I'm excited,
that's all, Doctor.

205
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:39,000
This is like being on
a roller coaster.

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Or a first date.

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,125
I'm all right.

208
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,250
I'll be the judge of that.

209
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,291
If your heart rate
gets too high,

210
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,667
we're going to
disconnect you.

211
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,250
Understood.

212
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,875
It's a mess in here.

213
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,458
There must be a breach
in the hull someplace.

214
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm picking up
atmospheric gases

215
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,709
in the corridor.

216
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,709
Methane and ammonia
primarily.

217
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:13,625
That break in the hull might
even be on the Bridge itself.

218
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,709
I'm heading
towards the Bridge.

219
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,375
I found someone.

220
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,875
DATA:
What is your position?

221
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:29,959
About 12 meters
up the main corridor.

222
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,041
He's trapped under some conduit
from the bulkhead.

223
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,917
I can't move it.

224
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,208
I'm going to need more power
to the tractor beam.

225
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,542
DR. CRUSHER:
Go to 80% of tolerance, Data.

226
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,417
No higher.

227
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,625
He's dead.

228
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,500
Data...

229
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
that door at the end
of this corridor.

230
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,834
What's it lead to?

231
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,291
DATA:
A magnetic Storage Bay.

232
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,291
If there was a break
in the Bridge,

233
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,250
that'd be
the safest place to go.

234
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,375
(<i> air hissing</i> )

235
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,166
(<i> beeping</i> )

236
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:19,792
(<i> grunting</i> )

237
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:22,750
Data, give me a phaser burst.

238
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,875
Narrow focus,
level four intensity.

239
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,667
I found them.

240
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,125
They're dead...

241
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,291
all of them.

242
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,709
There's a fire in here.

243
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,875
(<i> yelling in pain</i> )

244
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,875
Data, disconnect.

245
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,583
What happened?

246
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,083
Geordi?

247
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,875
I don't know.

248
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,959
My hands.

249
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:19,458
They're burned.

250
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,667
PICARD:
How did this happen?

251
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,250
DR. CRUSHER: There was
some kind of energy discharge

252
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,000
in the interface suit.

253
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,208
But shouldn't the safety
overrides have prevented that?

254
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,500
Yes, but I have a theory
why they didn't.

255
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,750
The tolerance levels
of the interface

256
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,500
were set extremely high.

257
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,125
I think Geordi's neural response
to the input was so strong

258
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,250
that it created
a feedback loop.

259
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,583
The sensors
that were transmitting

260
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,125
the sensation of heat
to my hands

261
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,333
must have overloaded.

262
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,417
The crew of
the<i> Raman</i> are dead.

263
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:52,792
I would like to retrieve them
and their vessel,

264
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,542
but not if it means putting
Geordi's safety at risk.

265
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,792
If we turn down the sensory
input on the probe,

266
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,709
I should be fine.

267
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,750
Seven people lost their lives
down there, Captain.

268
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,083
We should at least
retrieve the information
they were collecting.

269
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,709
Doctor?

270
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,250
If we operate the interface
at lower input levels,

271
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,166
I'd say the risk
is acceptable.

272
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,625
Picard to Riker.
Riker here.

273
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,417
We will proceed
with the probe.

274
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,000
We'll have to take it
into the<i> Raman's</i>

275
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,709
Auxiliary Control Room.

276
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:22,291
Their Bridge is
too badly damaged.

277
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,417
How long before you
have it in position?

278
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:25,750
RIKER:
A couple of hours.

279
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,208
We have to cut through
the bulkhead.

280
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,750
Acknowledged.

281
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,709
Well, it looks like
you'll have time to recuperate.

282
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:36,625
Yeah...

283
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:40,458
There's something
I've got to do anyway.

284
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,709
How are you, Dad?

285
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,583
As well as
could be expected...

286
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,041
under the circumstances.

287
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,709
Are<i> you</i> okay?
Yeah.

288
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,625
I spoke with your sister
this morning.

289
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,959
She said she'll be in touch
with you in a few days.

290
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,583
Right now,
she's pretty upset.

291
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,375
The service...

292
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:11,125
for the<i> Hera</i> will
probably be on Vulcan.

293
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,208
Most of the crew
were from there.

294
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:17,250
But your sister and I...
want to have a private ceremony.

295
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,333
Dad...

296
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:24,667
don't you think everybody's
jumping the gun here?

297
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,458
Last I heard,

298
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,000
there were still two starships
out there looking for them.

299
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,625
They found no debris,

300
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,667
no residual
warp distortion...
And no ship.

301
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,583
Not yet, but that
doesn't mean they won't.

302
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,291
Starfleet is considering
the<i> Hera</i> lost.

303
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:43,542
The search isn't much more
than a formality at this point.

304
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,875
Geordi...

305
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,917
your mother's gone.

306
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:53,041
Yeah, well, you can
think that if you want,

307
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,834
but until I see
some hard evidence,

308
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,709
I'm not going
to give up hope.

309
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,458
All right, Geordi.

310
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,208
Call me if you need anything.

311
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,709
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come in.

312
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,375
Hey, Data.

313
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,875
Still working?

314
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:36,583
No. I have completed the
adjustments to the interface.

315
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,375
I am now waiting
for Commander Riker

316
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,542
to finish
moving the probe.

317
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,583
Do you need
to be comforted?

318
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:48,250
No. I was just passing by.

319
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,583
I was wondering
what you were up to.

320
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,750
I am using the time to catch up
on my study of poetry.

321
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,709
LA FORGE: Data,
there's nothing on the screen.

322
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:04,792
That is not
entirely correct.

323
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,583
While it is true
the display is currently blank,

324
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,583
this... emptiness
has a poetic meaning.

325
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,709
Therefore, it cannot be
considered "nothing" as such.

326
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,166
Says who?

327
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,959
The ancient Doosodarians.

328
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,583
Much of their poetry contains
such "lacunae" or empty spaces.

329
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,709
Often these pauses measured
several days in length,

330
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:25,792
during which
poet and audience

331
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,625
were encouraged
to fully acknowledge

332
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,792
the emptiness of
the experience.

333
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,125
I can remember a few lectures
from Starfleet Academy

334
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,208
that seemed that way.

335
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,959
Are you certain you do not wish
to talk about your mother?

336
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,792
Why would you say that?

337
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,166
You are no doubt feeling
emotional distress

338
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,291
as a result of
her disappearance.

339
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,083
While you claim to be
"just passing by,"

340
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,542
that is most likely an excuse
to start a conversation

341
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,375
about this
uncomfortable subject.

342
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,083
Am I correct?
No, Data.

343
00:18:56,083 --> 00:19:00,625
Sometimes "just passing by"
means "just passing by."

344
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,500
Hmm.

345
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,250
Then I apologize for
my premature assumption.

346
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,250
This particular poem
has a lacuna of 47 minutes.

347
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,875
You may experience the emptiness
with me if you wish.

348
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,375
Thanks.

349
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,834
(<i> sighing</i> )

350
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,000
You know, Data,

351
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
maybe you gave up
a little too easily.

352
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,834
I do not understand.

353
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:36,125
Well, when I said

354
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,333
"just passing by"
means "just passing by,"

355
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,500
I really
didn't mean it.

356
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Then my initial
assumption was correct.

357
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,959
You<i> do</i> wish to speak
of your mother.

358
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,709
Am I crazy to think
that she's still alive?

359
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:52,834
Your sanity
is not in question.

360
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,542
However,
your evaluation

361
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:57,750
of the available
information<i> is</i> biased.

362
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,000
She's a starship captain.

363
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,125
She's gotten herself
into and out of

364
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,583
impossible
situations before.

365
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,500
Why should this
be any different?

366
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,375
Disappearances fitting
the profile of the<i> Hera</i>

367
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,625
have rarely ended with the safe
recovery of ship and crew.

368
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,834
Well, that makes me
feel much better.

369
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,000
(<i> sighs</i> )

370
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,291
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry, Data.

371
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,208
I didn't mean
to snap at you.

372
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,750
I am not offended.

373
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,208
You are upset.

374
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,291
Your reactions
are not surprising.

375
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,542
It's just that if...

376
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,667
if she really is dead...

377
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,583
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

378
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,333
We're receiving
the probe's telemetry.

379
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,417
The input levels are currently
at 53% of tolerance.

380
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:50,875
That's too low, Data.

381
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,834
I won't be able
to do anything down there.

382
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,625
I want to start with as wide
margin of safety as possible.

383
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,166
We can adjust upward later.

384
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,500
Ready?
Go ahead.

385
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,166
Initiating interface.
(<i> beeping</i> )

386
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,083
(<i> machinery powering up</i> )

387
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,417
I can't see anything.

388
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:08,917
DATA:
I am increasing the input now.

389
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,625
LA FORGE: Yeah.

390
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:14,250
Yeah, that's better,
but I need more.

391
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:19,041
DATA:
Is this level sufficient?

392
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,083
Geordi?

393
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:32,083
Geordi, do you hear me?

394
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,041
Mom?

395
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,375
Mom, is it you?

396
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,500
Is it<i> you?</i>

397
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,125
Oh, I forgot, all you
can see is this probe.

398
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,917
Yes! It's me!

399
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,542
I'm... I'm actually
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

400
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,208
I'm interfaced
with this probe.

401
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,417
Geordi, who are you
speaking to?

402
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:57,917
What are you seeing?

403
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,208
But is it really you?

404
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,250
Yes, Geordi.
It's Mom.

405
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,583
But how can that be?

406
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,041
I mean,
how is this possible?

407
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,917
There's no time
to explain.

408
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:10,458
We have to go down.

409
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,291
Down where?
The surface.

410
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,208
Geordi, report.

411
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,959
Hang on, Doctor.

412
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:20,208
Why? Why do we have to go
down to the surface?

413
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,917
We're dying.

414
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:24,792
We? The<i> Hera?</i>

415
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:26,875
You mean the<i> Hera</i> 
is down there?

416
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,208
DR. CRUSHER: We're
disconnecting you right now!
No, wait!

417
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,709
We need your help.
I need your help.

418
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:33,458
Mom!
Geordi!

419
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:37,083
The cutoff has been
automatically activated.

420
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,917
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

421
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:41,250
He's in neural shock.

422
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,333
DR. CRUSHER:
The sensory overload didn't
cause any permanent damage,

423
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,250
but I wouldn't want
to expose his brain

424
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,083
to that kind
of stimulus again.

425
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,542
Is there any indication what
caused this hallucination?

426
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,375
His brain functions
are normal.

427
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,166
I told you,
I wasn't hallucinating.

428
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:01,458
Geordi, I have analyzed
the probe's sensor logs.

429
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:04,291
There are no records to indicate
the presence of a living human

430
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,500
on board the<i> Raman.</i>

431
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,917
Well, she wasn't
exactly there.

432
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:08,333
Her ship is down
on the surface.

433
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,333
So, you believe
that what you saw

434
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,083
was some kind
of transmission?

435
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,500
Somehow she has managed
to communicate with me.

436
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,333
We have no indication of
a transmission of any kind.

437
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,667
Maybe I'm the only one
who can detect it

438
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,959
because I'm interfaced
with the probe.

439
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:27,458
The probe does allow Geordi
to sense quantum fluctuations,

440
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,834
subspace anomalies
and other phenomenon

441
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:32,250
not perceptible by
any other kind of sensor.

442
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,291
Granted, but how could he
perceive his mother visually

443
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,250
as if she were standing
there in the room?

444
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,125
I'm not sure, but I do know
that our brains weren't designed

445
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,458
to process the kind of sensory
information Geordi was getting.

446
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,875
When the brain receives
something it doesn't understand,

447
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,500
it interprets
the input as best it can--

448
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,041
sometimes as
a smell or a sound,

449
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,166
sometimes visually.
You see?

450
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:57,250
But, Geordi, I'm not
saying that your mother

451
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,834
was really communicating
with you.

452
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:01,250
I'm just trying
to give you a reason

453
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,792
why you might have
thought that she was.

454
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:04,291
Look, I'm telling you,

455
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,875
my mother's ship
is trapped down there

456
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,667
and-and we've got
to help them.

457
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:10,417
Geordi, the<i> Hera's</i> 
last reported position

458
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,417
was 300 light-years away.

459
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,750
How could it end up here?

460
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,583
If the<i> Hera</i> 
is on the surface,

461
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,375
its hull could not
possibly withstand

462
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,083
the pressure
of the atmosphere.

463
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,125
Well, at least let me go back
down there just to be sure.

464
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,959
I do not recommend that
he use the interface again.

465
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,583
The sensory overload
almost killed you.

466
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:28,166
I'll be all right.
No, no, I'm sorry, Geordi.

467
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,750
I'm not prepared
to risk your life.

468
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,041
Data, find another way
of salvaging the<i> Raman.</i>

469
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:35,500
I want an alternate
plan in two hours.

470
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,000
Geordi...

471
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,041
I'd like you to talk
to Counselor Troi.

472
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,750
(<i> frustrated sigh</i> )
She's expecting you.

473
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,250
What's your mother like,
Geordi?

474
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,875
If you think I'm going
to start talking

475
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:55,375
about my childhood,
Counselor, you're way off.

476
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,083
That's not what I asked.

477
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:05,166
Well... she's...

478
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,500
she's brilliant...

479
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,125
funny.

480
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,458
She's incredibly
perceptive.

481
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,834
She knows people.

482
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:22,250
Knows what they're all about
even before they open
their mouths.

483
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,000
She's always been that way.

484
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,959
She's...

485
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,709
she's a real good judge
of character.

486
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,709
When was the last time
you saw her?

487
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,875
About seven months ago

488
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,208
when she first took
command of the<i> Hera.</i>

489
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:38,542
I went to a party
she had for her crew.

490
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:41,208
She wanted me to
come over and see her,

491
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,834
but I was...
really busy at the time.

492
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:49,792
I mean, I suppose I
could have made the time

493
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:52,375
to go and see her,
but...

494
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:54,750
you know,
I just didn't think that...

495
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,542
I mean, you know, I...

496
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:02,458
I didn't think that...

497
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:05,375
You didn't think it would be
your last chance to see her.

498
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:07,500
That's not what
I was going to say.

499
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,875
I want to suggest
something.

500
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:17,625
Call it a theory,
all right?

501
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,750
All right.

502
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,709
You're worried about the
disappearance of your mother...

503
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:26,458
guilty that you didn't see her
when you had the chance,

504
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:30,375
so you're unwilling to consider
that she might be dead.

505
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:34,375
Your need to believe
she's alive is so strong

506
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:38,750
that it manifests itself
as a physical image.

507
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,792
Yes, but she told me
she's trapped on that planet,

508
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,333
that she's in danger.

509
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,917
Now, if this were
some sort of wish fulfillment,

510
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:46,750
don't you think
I'd be fantasizing her

511
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,375
safe and sound?

512
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:52,208
No, because that would be
the end of your fantasy.

513
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,208
You'd know
it wasn't true.

514
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,959
The more involved
and complicated

515
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:05,709
and unending
your story is,

516
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:10,291
the longer you can believe
your mother's still alive.

517
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:14,500
Yeah, well, that's
your theory, Counselor.

518
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,750
I've got one of my own.

519
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:23,709
I've been exploring
the possibility

520
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:26,750
of using a tractor beam to pull
the<i> Raman</i> from the atmosphere.

521
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,208
However, the high level
of interference

522
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:29,792
prevents a positive lock.

523
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:31,417
If we set up some sort
of relay system...?

524
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,542
That is my conclusion
as well, Commander--

525
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:36,458
two shuttlecraft staggered
between the<i> Enterprise</i> 
and the<i> Raman</i>

526
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:39,458
with their shields adjusted
to refocus the tractor beam.

527
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,375
Can we get the shuttles
close enough without danger?

528
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:46,542
Mr. La Forge?
Sure... um... yeah.

529
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:49,625
As long as we keep them both
above the troposphere,
that'll be all right.

530
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:51,166
Then in that case...

531
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,250
LA FORGE:
But what about the<i> Hera?</i>

532
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,000
We'd be leaving
my mother and her crew

533
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
stranded on the planet.

534
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,959
Commander...

535
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,542
I've been thinking about this.

536
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:02,333
A couple of weeks ago,
I got a message from my mother.

537
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,333
She said she had
a new chief engineer

538
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,375
who had been experimenting
with the warp drive.

539
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,792
Now, I've seen the<i> Hera.</i>

540
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:11,000
It uses trionic initiators
in the warp coil.

541
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,500
They have a reputation
for strange side effects,

542
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,417
especially when you start
playing around with them.

543
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,625
There<i> have</i> been
reports of warp bubbles

544
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:19,875
and other subspace
deformations.

545
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:23,333
So, what if that's
what happened?

546
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,709
Not a warp bubble,

547
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:28,959
but a subspace funnel.

548
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,542
Connecting two points
through subspace?

549
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,750
Well, the<i> Hera</i> could have
accidentally created

550
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,875
a distortion that emptied out
right here at Marijne VII.

551
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:40,250
Why here?
Well, the<i> Hera</i> passed by this
planet just ten days ago.

552
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,834
Now, there's an awful lot
of subspace disturbance
in the atmosphere.

553
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:46,208
The ship could have accidentally
picked up some residual traces

554
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,125
that directed the funnel
right back here.

555
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:50,166
So the<i> Hera's</i> in one piece
somewhere out there?

556
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,208
Well, maybe
it's being surrounded

557
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:55,417
by some kind of warp field,
but who knows for how long?

558
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:57,417
Mr. La Forge,
do you have any evidence

559
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:59,083
to support this hypothesis?

560
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:01,000
Well, I did pick up some pretty
strange subspace readings

561
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,375
when I was interfaced
with the probe.

562
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:03,917
Geordi, that could
have been anything.

563
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:05,667
LA FORGE: Yeah, but I talked
to her, Commander.

564
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,709
She asked me to bring
the<i> Raman</i> closer to the planet.

565
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:12,125
Mr. Data,
is any of this possible?

566
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,417
Yes, sir.

567
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:17,500
However,
it is highly unlikely.

568
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,834
How unlikely?

569
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:20,917
Nearly impossible, sir.

570
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:22,875
(<i> sighs</i> )

571
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,750
Let's proceed
with the shuttle plan.

572
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,291
Captain...
Dismissed.

573
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,834
Mr. La Forge.

574
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:37,667
I want you to know that
I am not unsympathetic

575
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,834
to what you're
going through.

576
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:42,208
Your mother's
disappearance is tragic,

577
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:44,458
but I cannot risk
your safety

578
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:47,041
on the basis of
a dubious hypothesis.

579
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:49,834
Captain, if I'm right,

580
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:52,000
and there's just one chance in
a million that she's alive...

581
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,458
I'm sorry, Geordi.

582
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,625
My decision is made.

583
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:58,500
I understand, sir.

584
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,125
We'll be in position
to use the tractor beam

585
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,417
in less than an hour.

586
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:16,291
You didn't come all the way
down here to tell me that.

587
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,417
No, I didn't.

588
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:21,333
Geordi...

589
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,208
I may have seemed
a little harsh

590
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,917
about the situation
aboard the<i> Raman.</i>

591
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:29,250
I just don't like the idea
of one of my best officers

592
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,208
putting himself
in unnecessary danger.

593
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,250
I guess I feel like
I should be the one

594
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,792
to decide whether
it's unnecessary or not.

595
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,834
My mother died
when I was a baby.

596
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:40,750
All I had was pictures

597
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,125
and the stories that my father
used to tell me about her.

598
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,667
I begged him to tell
those stories--

599
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,709
over and over.

600
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:56,625
When I was five
and I went to school,

601
00:30:56,625 --> 00:31:01,000
I started to tell my new
friends those same stories,

602
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,417
pretending that
she was alive.

603
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:06,333
Then I started believing
that she was alive--

604
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,875
that she had just
gone away...

605
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:12,333
but that she
was coming back.

606
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:15,542
The teacher
got wind of this.

607
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,458
She and my father
had this talk with me.

608
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:23,083
They told me it was important
to accept the fact

609
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,291
that my mother was dead

610
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:29,000
and that she wasn't
coming back

611
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,834
and all the hoping in
the world wouldn't make it so.

612
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:41,000
In my mind, that was the day
that my mother actually died.

613
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,542
I cried all that night,

614
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:48,959
but after that,
it started feeling better.

615
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:51,250
Your mother<i> was</i> dead.

616
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,583
There was proof.
There was a body and a funeral.

617
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,834
It was a reality.
Geordi...

618
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:57,625
If I could see a body

619
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,542
if there were wreckage,
I could accept it,

620
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,750
but my mother
has just disappeared

621
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,417
and now,
there's a possibility

622
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:09,000
that she<i> is</i> alive

623
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,333
and I'm not
going to quit.

624
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,250
Not yet.

625
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,333
(<i> machinery powering up</i> )

626
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,500
(<i> beeping</i> )

627
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:39,083
I suspected you would attempt
to operate the interface alone.

628
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,583
Did you?

629
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,375
I am familiar enough with
your behavior patterns

630
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:45,625
to predict certain...
decisions.

631
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,333
Well, I guess you know me
pretty well.

632
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,458
You are disobeying
the Captain.

633
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,333
I can't just sit back
and do nothing

634
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,250
when I know that my mother
may be down on that planet.

635
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,625
I cannot allow you to
endanger your well-being.

636
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:04,625
Data...
if I leave

637
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,250
without knowing for sure,

638
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,917
then I'll have to
live with that

639
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:12,083
for the rest of my life--
wondering if I left her to die.

640
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:14,792
I couldn't do that.

641
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,875
That's why
I've got to do this.

642
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,917
I could have you
confined to quarters

643
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,500
for the duration
of the mission.

644
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,041
If that's what you need
to do, Data, then do it,

645
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,500
because nothing
short of that

646
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,500
is going to stop me from
trying to save my mother.

647
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,041
What are you doing?

648
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:37,917
I will monitor the interface
and attempt to keep you safe.

649
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,417
I cannot have you
confined to quarters

650
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:44,333
for something
you have not yet done.

651
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:47,333
You know, we could both get
into a lot of trouble for this.

652
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:51,583
There is a high degree
of probability

653
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:54,000
that you are correct.

654
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,083
Thanks, Data.

655
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:00,792
However,
I do have a request.

656
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:03,291
Yeah? What's that?

657
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,083
I would ask you to
consider the possibility

658
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:09,667
that what you see
is not real.

659
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:12,542
I will.

660
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:14,542
I promise.

661
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,875
I am establishing
the interface.

662
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:30,208
LA FORGE:
Mom?

663
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:34,834
Mom?

664
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,834
Hello, Geordi.

665
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:38,834
Mom.

666
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:40,750
How did you get here?

667
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,291
I'm not really
with you, Geordi.

668
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,166
I'm on my ship
on the surface.

669
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,375
We were pulled
into a warp funnel.

670
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,458
That's just
what I thought.

671
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:52,709
<i>How</i> are we
communicating?

672
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:55,000
We found a way to send
a subspace signal

673
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,333
that could cut through
the atmospheric interference.

674
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,417
DATA: Geordi, are you seeing
the image of your mother?

675
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:03,583
Yes, and she's just confirmed
everything I've been saying.

676
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:07,291
I am reading unusual subspace
energy in your vicinity

677
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,125
similar to what
the probe sensor recorded

678
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,208
the first time
you encountered your mother.

679
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,792
That's how she's
communicating with me.

680
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,083
It's the only kind of signal
they could send

681
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,959
that could cut through
the interference.

682
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,500
We need your help.

683
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
I've been thinking
about this.

684
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,875
I'm going to take the<i> Raman</i> 
into a low stationary orbit

685
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,125
and initiate
an inverse warp cascade.

686
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,667
Why?

687
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:32,000
The subspace distortion
from the cascade

688
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,625
should reverse
the warp funnel.

689
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:36,250
Your ship will end up
right back where it started.

690
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,125
Geordi,
the atmosphere

691
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,792
becomes increasingly turbulent
the farther down you go.

692
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:42,709
You may not be able
to bring the<i> Raman</i>

693
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:45,375
close enough to the<i> Hera</i> 
before being destroyed.

694
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:46,667
I have to try, Data.

695
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:48,917
We're running out of time.

696
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,750
Shields back online.

697
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,250
We're starting
our descent.

698
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,125
(<i> sighs</i> )
Thank God.

699
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,667
Thank God?

700
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,375
That you're alive

701
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:04,041
that I was right
about all of this.

702
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:06,333
I can't wait
to call Dad.

703
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,667
He and Ariana
had given up.

704
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,709
We're going home.

705
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:12,959
Well, eventually, yeah...

706
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:14,375
Data...

707
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:18,291
everything's fading
in and out.

708
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:20,125
I'm losing the interface.

709
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,375
The probe is descending
out of range.

710
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:25,333
You'll have to turn up the input
gain to maintain my connection.

711
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:28,291
We are already
at 75% of tolerance.

712
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:30,125
Data, you can turn it

713
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:32,917
all the way up to a 100
if you do it slowly enough--

714
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:35,375
give my nervous system
a chance to adjust.

715
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,375
That is theoretically true,

716
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:40,458
but even at this level of input,
you are already experiencing

717
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,375
dangerous neural feedback.

718
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:45,000
There are over 300 people
are on board the<i> Hera,</i> Data.

719
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,375
You and I are the only
chance they've got.

720
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:54,333
I will increase the gain
incrementally as you descend.

721
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,250
It's working.

722
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,917
When we are ready
to disconnect the interface,

723
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:05,625
we must allow enough time
to lower the input levels.

724
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,792
Otherwise, your nervous system
will go into shock

725
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,250
from the sudden drop in input.

726
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,250
Well, once I initiate
the warp cascade,

727
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,917
we can start
dropping the gain.

728
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:14,625
DATA:
Understood.

729
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:17,208
We'll be within
sensor range of the<i> Hera</i>

730
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:20,333
in a few minutes.

731
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,667
Mom...

732
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,375
I'm really sorry
I didn't get by to see you

733
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:26,750
a couple of weeks ago.

734
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:30,000
You were too busy
with work.

735
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,250
Yeah, well,
I'm sorry.

736
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,417
It won't
happen again.

737
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:38,458
(<i> beeping</i> )

738
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:42,166
Captain, the<i> Raman</i> is
descending toward the planet.

739
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:45,875
Geordi.

740
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:47,917
We are at 90% of tolerance.

741
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:51,542
My calculations show
you will reach 100% of tolerance

742
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:53,417
before you are
in range of the<i> Hera.</i>

743
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:55,875
Then we're going to have
to go beyond tolerance.

744
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,667
That would not be advisable.

745
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,667
You must cease your descent.

746
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:01,291
No, Geordi, don't.

747
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:03,041
Please.

748
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:08,375
Data... I'm taking
this ship down.

749
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:12,542
Now, if you don't boost the gain
past tolerance levels,

750
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,375
I'll lose the interface
when we go out of range

751
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,208
and my system
will go into shock.

752
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:19,667
Geordi, you are putting me
in a difficult position.

753
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:21,834
Please,
cease your descent.

754
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:24,125
I won't do it, Data.

755
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,667
You're going to have
to increase the tolerance.

756
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,917
Disengaging safety systems.

757
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:37,125
Going to full tolerance
levels... now.

758
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:40,667
Thank you, Data.

759
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:43,709
We're getting close.

760
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:45,834
Thank God.

761
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:48,166
PICARD:
Commander La Forge.

762
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,542
Yes, Captain.
Stop your descent.

763
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,500
Prepare to disengage
the interface.

764
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,542
I'm sorry, Captain,
but I can't do that.

765
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:56,959
Damn it, Geordi,
you're going to kill yourself.

766
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,583
If I come back now, my mother
and her entire crew will die.

767
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:03,834
I'm scanning
for your ship.

768
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:06,208
I'm not getting anything.

769
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:09,709
We're still
too far away.

770
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:13,125
No, not really.

771
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:15,959
I should be picking
<i>something</i> up by now.

772
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:20,208
I'm not finding anything.

773
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:23,417
There's no warp funnel...

774
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:26,458
no ship...

775
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,667
there's nothing there.

776
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:35,500
PICARD:
Doctor, report.

777
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,417
His neural synapses
are overloading.

778
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,709
He can't survive this.

779
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,041
Geordi,
what's happening to you?

780
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:43,250

781
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,083

783

786
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,500
You're killing us.

787
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,917
We must go down.

788
00:40:04,917 --> 00:40:07,500
PICARD:
Geordi...

789
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,583
what's happening? Report.

790
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:12,458
You're... you're trapped?

791
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:14,583
Is there any way
that we can disconnect him?

792
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:17,166
If we take him off
too abruptly,

793
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,583
he'll go into neural shock.

794
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,542
Caught on the ship?

795
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:22,959
Reduce the input gradually

796
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:24,875
and still get him out
before it's too late.

797
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:27,458
Are you saying that you killed
the<i> Raman's</i> crew?

798
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,625
Perhaps we could deceive
his neural receptors.
Deceive them?

799
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,333
By feeding them
the sensory information

800
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,625
recorded from his early
experiences with the probe.

801
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,500
We could disconnect
the interface

802
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,458
and still maintain
the input levels.

803
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,625
We could then lower them
in a controlled manner.

804
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,041
What do you want?

805
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:44,792
Like a decompression tank.
Let's try it.

806
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,542
LA FORGE:
It was an accident...

807
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:49,333
Captain, I have to take the ship
into the lower atmosphere.

808
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,542
Explain.

809
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:52,000
As I understand it,

810
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,625
when the<i> Raman</i> got close
to the planet,

811
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,792
it accidentally picked up
some life-forms

812
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:58,208
that live
in the lower atmosphere--

813
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:01,625
subspace beings of some kind--
intelligent.

814
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,083
When the ship went back
into a higher orbit,

815
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,667
the beings were trapped.

816
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:06,917
How do you know all this?

817
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:08,875
One of them can
communicate with me.

818
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:11,792
It must have read my thoughts
through the probe interface

819
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:14,208
and took the form
of my mother

820
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:16,959
to try to talk me into taking
the ship closer to the surface.

821
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:18,291
Are these beings responsible

822
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:19,959
for the death
of the<i> Raman's</i> crew?

823
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:22,875
LA FORGE: Yes, but I don't
think it was on purpose.

824
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:25,375
They probably tried
communicating with them

825
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:28,000
the same way they're
communicating with me--

826
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,166
by directly accessing
their thoughts.

827
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,333
It must have been
fatal to the crew.

828
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:36,166
I guess the interface
is what protected me.

829
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:38,625
I have to take
them back, Captain.

830
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:42,041
They can't survive
so far up in the atmosphere.

831
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,333
I'll turn the ship around
and come back
