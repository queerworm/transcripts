1
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:06,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47304.2.</i>

2
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:10,041
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has arrived</i>
<i>at Kesprytt III</i>

3
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:14,375
<i>in order to evaluate an unusual</i>
<i>request on the part of the Kes</i>

4
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:18,000
<i>for associate membership</i>
<i>in the Federation.</i>

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:21,083
This morning,
she was 15 minutes late.

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,458
That's the third time
this week.

7
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:27,917
(<i> tapping</i> )

8
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:29,625
Jean-Luc.

9
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,375
You don't have
the slightest idea

10
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:32,750
what I'm talking
about, do you?

11
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:36,125
No. I'm really sorry.
I don't.

12
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,000
I've been telling you
about Nurse Ogawa
and Ensign Markson

13
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,458
for the last 15 minutes.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,041
You have?
Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,500
I'm really sorry.

16
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:46,041
Are you worried about
this mission with the Kes?

17
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:49,083
Not worried, exactly.

18
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,709
This notion of admitting
half their planet

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,792
while leaving
the other half out...

20
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,917
First of all, the Kes
are not half the planet.

21
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:59,917
They're nearly 3/4 of it.

22
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,208
And the Prytt are
not being left out.

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,333
They themselves
simply don't want
to have contact

24
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,625
with anyone
from the outside--

25
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,333
not the Federation
or anyone else.

26
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:12,333
Every member of the Federation
entered as a unified world,

27
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,792
and that unity said
something about them--

28
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:19,083
that they had resolved
certain social and
political differences

29
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,542
and they were now ready
to become part of
a larger community.

30
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,417
By all indications
the Kes are a very unified,
very progressive people.

31
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,834
But the Prytt are not.

32
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,792
They're reclusive
to the point of xenophobia.

33
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:32,750
Well, think about Earth.

34
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,875
What if one of
the old nation states--
say, Australia,

35
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:39,417
had decided not to join
the world government
in 2150?

36
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,375
Would that have disqualified
us as a Federation member?

37
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,667
That analogy is not...

38
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,041
Riker to captain.

39
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,375
Go ahead, Number One.

40
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:48,959
We've received word
from Ambassador Mauric,

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,792
he's ready to see you
and Dr. Crusher.

42
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:53,208
Inform him
we're on our way.

43
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,542
Thank you for breakfast.

44
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,792
Wait until tomorrow.

45
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:01,709
I have something
very special planned.

46
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,542
It's a Vulcan dish,
that's all I'll say.

47
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:10,959
Captain, doctor.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,917
I have the coordinates
of Ambassador Mauric's
chambers.

49
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,041
Let's not keep them
waiting, Mr. Worf.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,792
<i>Enterprise</i> to Kes
Security Relay Station One.

51
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,709
We are ready
to commence transport.

52
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,083
Acknowledged,<i> Enterprise.</i>

53
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,959
We have lowered
our defense shield.

54
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,125
Confirmed.

55
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,375
Energize.

56
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,917
MALE:
This is Security
Relay Station One.

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,792
We are ready to receive your
captain and medical officer.

58
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:43,542
This is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

59
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,000
We have already completed
the transport sequence.

60
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,458
You should have them.

61
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,000
Negative,<i> Enterprise.</i>

62
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,500
They're not here.

63
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:27,917
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

64
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,959
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,792
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

66
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:37,750
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

67
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:42,375
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

68
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:47,125
<i>to boldly go where</i>
<i>no one has gone before.</i>

69
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,667
Beverly.

70
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,875
Beverly.

71
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,083
What happened?

72
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,709
I don't know.

73
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,792
The last thing
I remember,

74
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:28,834
we were beginning
to transport.

75
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,166
I assume we must
be on Kesprytt

76
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,083
and we're in some
kind of prison cell.

77
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,792
The question is why?

78
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,542
I can't imagine
that Ambassador Mauric

79
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,792
would have any reason to detain
us.

80
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:44,917
Jean-Luc...

81
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,166
What is it?

82
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,083
Let me see.

83
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,500
What?

84
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,041
It looks like
an implant.

85
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,792
Seems to be connected
directly to the brain stem.

86
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,250
Is it some kind
of coercive device?

87
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,375
Whatever it is I doubt
it's designed for our health.

88
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,375
What is
going on here?

89
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:15,083
If you could tell us
why you've taken us
hostage, we might be able...

90
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,834
You are not hostages.

91
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,125
You are prisoners.

92
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,834
Prisoners on
whose authority?

93
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,375
You're being held
under the authority

94
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,625
of the Prytt
security ministry.

95
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,083
The charges are conspiring
with the enemy.

96
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,458
Enemy?
You mean the Kes.

97
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,750
We are not fools.

98
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,500
We are aware of
the Federation attempt

99
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:32,542
to establish a military
alliance with the Kes.

100
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,375
It will not be tolerated.

101
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:36,792
Your information
is incorrect.

102
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,250
We have no plans...

103
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,333
There is no point
in trying to
mislead us, captain.

104
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,041
The devices
which have been implanted
in your cerebral cortexes

105
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,959
will soon be calibrated
to your psi-wave pattern.

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,458
At that time we will
be able to get all
the information we need.

107
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:55,417
And then you'll
discover that we are
telling the truth.

108
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,834
We shall see.

109
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,959
There is nothing wrong
with the transporter.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,417
I have run
a complete diagnostic

111
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,375
of all of the targeting
components.

112
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,417
Then what happened
to the captain
and Dr. Crusher?

113
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,458
Commander,
the transporter
sensor log

114
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,000
shows an unusual
concentration

115
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,000
of antigraviton particles
in the emitter coil.

116
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,458
A concentration
of antigraviton particles

117
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,834
suggests a tractor beam.

118
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,250
It might have deflected
the transporter beam

119
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,917
to a different set
of coordinates.

120
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,291
Is there a way to locate
those coordinates?

121
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,625
The tractor beam
originated

122
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,583
somewhere in
the Prytt Alliance.

123
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,125
What does the Prytt want with
Captain Picard and Dr. Crusher?

124
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,625
I don't know,
and it's not going
to be easy to find out.

125
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:50,709
The Prytt have
consistently refused
all outside contact.

126
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,875
We're going to have
to work through the Kes.

127
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:54,500
Contact
Ambassador Mauric.

128
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:55,875
Tell him I want
a meeting right now.

129
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:57,083
Aye, sir.

130
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,834
What?
What?

131
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,291
You're staring at me.

132
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,667
I was just thinking about
how to get out of here.

133
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:17,333
There may be
a structural flaw

134
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,709
that would allow us
to escape.

135
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,291
Right.

136
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,625
Beverly,
the important thing
during any confinement

137
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,834
is to think positively,
and not give up hope.

138
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,500
There is a way
out of every box--

139
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:27,959
a solution
to every puzzle.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,834
It's just a matter
of finding it.

141
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,125
Damn!

142
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,500
Well, at least this means
we won't starve to death.

143
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:52,000
It means they plan on
keeping us here for awhile.

144
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,792
I'm beginning to think
negatively, Jean-Luc.

145
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,542
My tricorder.

146
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,750
Does it work?

147
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,583
Yes.

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,917
Except something's been added
to the main directory.

149
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:09,291
It's a map.

150
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,959
An escape route.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,750
That guard must be
working for the Kes.

152
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,291
Possibly,
but it could be

153
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,500
part of a very
carefully laid trap.

154
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:19,834
Well, if you ask me,

155
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,083
I'd like to take
my chances out there.

156
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,500
Agreed.

157
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,500
Is there a way
to open the cell door?

158
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,834
Yes. The code's
been entered.

159
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,667
Commander, on behalf
of my government

160
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,250
I would like to take
this opportunity

161
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,083
to present
my profound apologies

162
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,667
regarding this
unfortunate incident.

163
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,542
That's very kind,
Ambassador,

164
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,959
but I don't think
anyone here holds you
or the Kes government

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,417
responsible
for what happened.

166
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,166
Our primary concern
is not to assign blame

167
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,959
but to recover
our missing officers.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,417
I agree.

169
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,583
We are prepared to insert
a hostage rescue team

170
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,542
into the Prytt capital city
on three hours' notice.

171
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,625
Ambassador, we have
not even attempted
a diplomatic effort yet.

172
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,750
I would rather not use force
until we've exhausted
all other options.

173
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't believe there<i> is</i> any
diplomatic option, Commander.

174
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,917
We have no formal relations
with the Prytt, no ambassadors.

175
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,250
There's simply no way
to contact them.

176
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,417
Surely, you must have
some means of communication

177
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,250
in case
of a planetary emergency.

178
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,375
We have never had need
of such a system.

179
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:41,125
We can determine their
communications frequencies

180
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,542
and establish a link.

181
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,250
Allow me
to be blunt.

182
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,125
The Prytt are a fanatical,
xenophobic people

183
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,709
with little regard
for civilized discourse.

184
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,959
Even if you do establish

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,250
a communications
link with them

186
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,041
it will be a complete
waste of time.

187
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,500
How long has it been
since your last
diplomatic contact?

188
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:59,125
Humph!

189
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,667
Almost a century.

190
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:03,667
Then it's possible they may
have changed over the years.

191
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:10,375
We have had other less...
formal contacts with the Prytt--

192
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:12,834
contacts
we cannot discuss--

193
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:13,917
but I can assure you,

194
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,083
they have changed
very little.

195
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,917
RIKER:
With all due respect,
Ambassador,

196
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,458
I think I should try to
communicate with the Prytt

197
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,208
before I sanction
the use of force.

198
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,917
Of course, Commander.

199
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,625
In the meantime,
I will continue
making preparations

200
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,709
for a rescue mission.

201
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,125
Agreed.

202
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,166
I do have one request.

203
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,417
We believe that the Prytt
obtained their information

204
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,750
about the transport of
your captain and doctor

205
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,625
through a breach of our
communications network.

206
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,959
If I could establish
a base of operations

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,417
here on the<i> Enterprise,</i> 
I'd feel much more secure.

208
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,041
Mr. Worf will help you.

209
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,333
Thank you.

210
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,792
Lieutenant.

211
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,083
You first.

212
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,917
(<i> sighing</i> )

213
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,166
Is there a problem,
Ambassador?

214
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,542
Probably not.

215
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,333
Simply securing the area.

216
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,875
I can assure you
there is no need.

217
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,709
I'm sure you're right.

218
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,834
Yes, this will do
very nicely.

219
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,458
As security chief
of the<i> Enterprise,</i>

220
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,250
I would be glad to assist
you in any way possible.

221
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,417
There's no need.

222
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,709
We'll take care
of everything.

223
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,959
Thank you,
Lieutenant.

224
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,583
There must be
a lava flow

225
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,000
or an underground
hot spring

226
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,000
somewhere near here.

227
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,000
It's a lava flow.

228
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,041
It's about
30 meters below us.

229
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,041
It says we should
go this way.

230
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,291
I smell gas.

231
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,000
This whole chamber
is filled with pockets

232
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,208
of a methanogenic compound.

233
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,667
Can we get
through it?

234
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,625
I think so.

235
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,792
What did you say?

236
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:41,375
I didn't say anything.

237
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:44,166
There might be
a fairly regular pattern
to these eruptions.

238
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,166
We should be able
to navigate our way
through them

239
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,709
if we're careful.

240
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,792
Say when.

241
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,291
Now.

242
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,792
The eruptions
have stopped.

243
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,917
(<i> beeping loudly</i> )
The gas is building up.

244
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,250
I have scanned the entire
Prytt communications system.

245
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,125
This appears to be the
primary access module

246
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,750
for their
central government.

247
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,583
Can you determine which
of the com links is connected

248
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,792
to the prime minister's
office?

249
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:39,125
I believe so, sir.

250
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,875
However, the Prytt
have no link designed

251
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:42,458
for extraterritorial
communications.

252
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,417
Our hail may come as
quite a surprise to them.

253
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,041
Well, they're going
to have to adjust.

254
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,834
Open a channel.

255
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,709
This is Prime Minister
Horath's headquarters.

256
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,917
How can I be of service?

257
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,041
This is Commander
William T. Riker,

258
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,750
Federation Starship
<i>Enterprise.</i>

259
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,291
I know this may seem
an unusual way...

260
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,959
The<i> Enterprise?</i> 
You mean the ship in orbit?

261
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,542
That's right.

262
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,125
Why are you
on this com link?

263
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,667
We're having trouble contacting
your government directly.

264
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:09,792
We had to start somewhere.

265
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,250
If you would
let me talk to...

266
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,166
Did you get authorization
for this communication

267
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,083
from the security ministry?

268
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,083
As I said, we're having
trouble contacting your...

269
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,083
I cannot participate in
an unauthorized communication.

270
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,458
This transmission
is terminated.

271
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,291
Not very friendly,
are they?

272
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,291
No, sir.

273
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,792
(<i> beeping</i> )

274
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:32,917
Sir,
we are being hailed.

275
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,000
It is the Prytt
security council.

276
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,125
Well, it looks like we got
someone's attention.

277
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,458
On screen.

278
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:44,417
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is
Security Minister Lorin.

279
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,500
You will immediately cease
all attempts

280
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:48,083
at communication
with our people.

281
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,458
Minister, we have been
attempting

282
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,458
to contact someone
in your government.

283
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
It appears that
you have detained
two of our officers.

284
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:55,166
We would like to discuss
the situation.

285
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,917
There is nothing
to discuss.

286
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,875
If you do not terminate
these transmissions,
we will be forced

287
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,792
to take aggressive action
against your ship.

288
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,834
Their weapon systems
pose no threat
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

289
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:14,291
Just the same,
let's keep the shields up
for the time being.

290
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,333
Aye, sir.

291
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,083
Is there a problem,
Commander?

292
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,375
Our effort with the Prytt
just ran into a wall.

293
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:23,750
I'm sorry, but perhaps this
will brighten your spirits.

294
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,959
We have freed
your captain and doctor.

295
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,750
What?

296
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,792
They were being held
in a prison just outside
the Prytt capital

297
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:32,834
but one of our operatives was
able to arrange their escape.

298
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,291
Where are they now?

299
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,959
Well, they should be
en route to the Kes border.

300
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,208
Our operative provided them
with a detailed map

301
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,750
and instructions
on where to go.

302
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,667
How will you get them
across the border?

303
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,917
At the moment,
that information

304
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,709
is confidential,
but trust us--

305
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,041
we do have a plan.

306
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,834
Ambassador, I'm afraid
I must insist

307
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,041
that you provide us
with more information.

308
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,750
Oh, I understand
your concern, of course,

309
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:54,333
but I would feel
more comfortable

310
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,208
discussing these
operational details

311
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,542
in a less public
environment.

312
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,667
Certainly, we can step
into the ready room.

313
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:04,667
I would prefer the quarters
you provided me.

314
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:05,875
They're safer.

315
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,041
All right.

316
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,625
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

317
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,750
There's no way
out of here.

318
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,917
Maybe we took
a wrong turn.

319
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,208
So am I.

320
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,917
What?
I'm thirsty, too.

321
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:35,041
I didn't say anything
about being thirsty.

322
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,166
I heard you.

323
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,000
You said,
"I'm very thirsty."

324
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,417
I was thinking about it,
but I didn't say anything.

325
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,542
You were<i> thinking</i> it?

326
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,875
The transceivers.

327
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,834
Lorin said that they would
align themselves

328
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,250
to our psi-wave patterns.

329
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,583
The implants must be
transmitting our thoughts.

330
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,542
What am I thinking?

331
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,333
I don't know.

332
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,792
I can't hear your
thoughts either.

333
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,291
Well, maybe
it was a fluke.

334
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,709
Well, right now, we have
more immediate concerns.

335
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,583
Does your map show us
a way out of here?

336
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,542
Yes.
We need to go up.

337
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,250
There's a ledge
about 30 meters up.

338
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,750
That should lead
to another tunnel

339
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:24,500
that connects up
to the surface.

340
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,208
Right.

341
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,000
I heard<i> that.</i>

342
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,625
They weren't words
exactly--

343
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:39,583
a sudden sense of...

344
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,583
fear.

345
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,417
A sense of fear
of heights.

346
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,709
So much for that
being a fluke.

347
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,667
It was a strange sensation,

348
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,208
suddenly having these thoughts
appear in my mind.

349
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,125
If you sensed a fear of heights,
you sensed pretty accurately.

350
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,917
Come on.

351
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:58,875
You've done this before.
It's just like on the holodeck.

352
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,750
One step at a time.

353
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:03,250
Just climbing,
steadily and slowly.

354
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,917
Right.

355
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,458
(<i> door opens</i> )

356
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,250
I see you've done
some redecorating.

357
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:28,166
Just a few pieces of equipment
necessary for security reasons.

358
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,542
You understand?

359
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,667
Certainly.

360
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:33,291
He is, uh...
all right.

361
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:42,875
How do you plan
to get our people
out of Prytt territory?

362
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,333
You must realize
that everything

363
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,166
I'm about to say
cannot leave this room.

364
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,583
For some time, we have
had certain... friends

365
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,125
among the Prytt--
citizens who realize

366
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,125
that the long struggle
between our two peoples

367
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,375
can only end when
the Prytt government

368
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:59,417
is made to see reason.

369
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,750
You've recruited
a few Prytt spies.

370
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:05,583
That's a crude
but accurate term.

371
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,041
These friends
will be waiting

372
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,500
for your captain
and doctor

373
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:09,667
when they reach
the village

374
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,750
of Ohn-kor, near
the Kes border.

375
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,250
The map we provided
your officers

376
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,792
will take them
to a tavern there.

377
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:17,959
Forgive me, Ambassador,
but is it wise to send

378
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,458
two human fugitives
in Starfleet uniforms
into a Prytt village?

379
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,166
The danger is minimal.

380
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,417
Our operatives control
almost the whole village.

381
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:31,208
Once contact has been
made with Captain Picard
and Dr. Crusher

382
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,542
our friends will escort them
across the border into Kes.

383
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,834
I would still feel better

384
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,458
if they could rendezvous
with your operatives

385
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,166
in a less public place.

386
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,333
Commander, I assure you,
we know what we're doing.

387
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,834
We've had a great deal
of experience

388
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,834
in dealing
with the Prytt.

389
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,500
We would hardly risk
the safety of your people.

390
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,750
After all, we still hope
that you will recommend

391
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,166
our entrance
into the Federation.

392
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:23,083
One of us is hungry.

393
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,458
That would be me.

394
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,667
Would you mind thinking
of something else?

395
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:26,792
You're making me hungry.

396
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,458
What do you want me
to think about?

397
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,709
Something other
than a large bowl
of vegetable soup.

398
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,208
My grandmother
used to make it
with peas, carrots...

399
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,375
Beverly!
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,583
I am<i> not</i> being
unreasonable.

401
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,083
I didn't say
that you were.

402
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,208
I may have thought it,
but there's a difference.

403
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:46,667
You're right.

404
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:48,417
We can't react to
every random thought

405
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,875
that crosses the
other person's mind.

406
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,750
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

407
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:53,250
Isn't it
astonishing, though,

408
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,000
how much clutter there is
in the consciousness?

409
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,500
Odd memories coming
to the surface,

410
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:58,166
bits of half-
remembered songs.

411
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,000
Stray daydreams,
scattered minutiae.

412
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,667
I wonder how true telepaths
sift through it all.

413
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:05,542
How can they really get
to what someone's thinking

414
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,458
if the mind keeps churning
all this flotsam
to the surface?

415
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,959
That is not funny.

416
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,417
I wanted to see if you
were still listening.

417
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,583
I think our link
is getting stronger.

418
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,625
Maybe if we put some
distance between us

419
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:22,834
that might weaken it.

420
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,542
Not that I'm growing
tired of hearing

421
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,750
your most intimate thoughts.

422
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,208
Certainly not.

423
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,875
Jean-Luc...

424
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,208
What happened?

425
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,834
Oh...

426
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,375
I was suddenly overcome
with a wave of nausea.

427
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:45,792
Me, too.

428
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,667
Hmm...

429
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:52,625
there's nothing wrong
with either of us.

430
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,959
Maybe the air is toxic.

431
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,542
Oh...

432
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,000
(<i> gasping</i> )

433
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,750
Oh, same thing.

434
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:05,291
But when you moved back
to me, it got better.

435
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:12,417
Well, it seems
as if we're... stuck
with each other.

436
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,083
What is it?

437
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,250
I'm not sure
whether we should go

438
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,583
over this hill or that one.

439
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,083
The topography on this map
is a little vague.

440
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,583
Let me see.

441
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,500
This way.

442
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:58,667
You don't really know,
do you?

443
00:23:58,709 --> 00:23:59,875
What?

444
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:01,291
I mean, you're acting
like you know

445
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,750
exactly which way to go
but you're only guessing.

446
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:06,250
Do you do this
all the time?

447
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:10,667
No, but there are times
when it is necessary

448
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:13,542
for a captain to
give the appearance
of confidence.

449
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,959
I... I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

450
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,834
I just couldn't resist.

451
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,625
I'm beginning to realize
that you always seem to have

452
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:25,542
some acerbic remark on
the tip of your tongue.

453
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,041
Well, at least
I've trained myself

454
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,000
not to say it anymore.

455
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,709
When I was a little girl

456
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,417
my mouth was always
landing me in trouble

457
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,166
with my parents,
my teachers...

458
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,417
And your friends.

459
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:42,333
There was someone
called Tom Norris?

460
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,166
That's right.
I had one date with him

461
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,500
which I brought
to an abrupt halt

462
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:46,792
with the words,
"Is that a beard...

463
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:48,709
BOTH:
...or is your face dirty?"

464
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,417
There's something more.

465
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,250
You're laughing,
but actually

466
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,375
you were embarrassed
by that incident.

467
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,041
Yes.

468
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,542
I thought I was being cute,
but I really hurt him.

469
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,542
That was a long time ago.

470
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,750
I learned
a valuable lesson.

471
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:19,000
This sharing of thoughts
and feelings is...

472
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,875
quite compelling.

473
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:23,250
Very.

474
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,125
We'd better get going.

475
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,709
I don't think so either.

476
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,250
Maybe we can find
another way

477
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,959
to reach the village.

478
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,625
No. It's several
kilometers

479
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,375
to find another way
around that ridge.

480
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:03,875
The border is just
two kilometers east of here.

481
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,125
There's a force-field
protecting it,
but we can find

482
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,875
some way to deal with that
when we get there.

483
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:09,458
Come on.

484
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,125
All right.

485
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,250
Something wrong?

486
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,500
Have a seat.

487
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:38,375
Captain Picard
and Dr. Crusher
did not show up

488
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:40,875
at the designated
rendezvous point.

489
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:42,333
Do you know
what happened to them?

490
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,709
No. We have no idea what
happened to them.

491
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,750
We find it strange
that your officers

492
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:49,625
should follow the escape plan
so precisely and then fail

493
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,041
to make the crucial rendezvous
with our operative.

494
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,375
Well, it is possible
they have been recaptured.

495
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:57,875
Our sources would have
informed us instantly
if that had happened.

496
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:02,208
Of course, if they
weren't captured...

497
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,834
if they simply made
a different rendezvous...

498
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,375
we might not ever
know about it.

499
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,250
A<i> different</i> rendezvous?

500
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:10,667
I'm not sure I know
what you mean.

501
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:12,333
Of course not.

502
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,041
How could you know
if your captain and doctor

503
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,667
were meeting secretly
with the Prytt?

504
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:19,750
Meeting in order to set up
a military alliance

505
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:20,875
with the Federation?

506
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:23,250
What?
It was a clever scheme.

507
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:26,500
First, you pretend
to lose your officers
during transport.

508
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:29,208
Then you ask us for help
and get us to expose

509
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,458
several of our undercover
operatives in the process,

510
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,291
but what you didn't
expect was for us

511
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,000
to get your people
out of prison so quickly.

512
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,750
They needed more time,
they needed more time

513
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:38,000
to plot the destruction
of the Kes

514
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,125
with their new
Prytt friends.

515
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:42,917
This is ridiculous.

516
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:45,125
You're beginning to see
conspiracies everywhere.

517
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,583
We were invited here
by the Kes.

518
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,750
Why would we ally ourselves
with the Prytt?

519
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,125
Indeed, why?

520
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:54,250
Ah... you can believe
what you like.

521
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:56,709
We're going to find our people
with or without your help.

522
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,959
Then I believe
it is time for us

523
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,750
to be leaving
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

524
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:01,166
Fine.

525
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,709
Make sure you take
all this junk with you.

526
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,125
No luck?

527
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

528
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,083
I'm beginning to think
there's not a single thing

529
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,959
on this planet we can eat.

530
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,083
Well, by this time
tomorrow

531
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,583
we could be back
on board the<i> Enterprise</i>

532
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,625
and you can plant yourself
in front of a replicator

533
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:29,083
with a knife and fork.

534
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:32,333
Remember that Vulcan dish
I promised for breakfast?

535
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:33,667
Well, I was just...

536
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:35,959
You hate having
breakfast with me.

537
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,291
That's not true.
Yes, it is.

538
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,417
When I said breakfast,

539
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:40,834
I heard you say,
"I hate that."

540
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,250
That's not quite
what I meant.

541
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,041
Well, then
what did you mean?

542
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,041
It's just that
I don't like...

543
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,959
What I've been choosing
for breakfast recently.

544
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,875
You see,
I think that breakfast
should be a simple meal

545
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:55,250
and recently,
you've been ordering
these elaborate things.

546
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,875
Coffee and croissants.

547
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:58,667
That's all you really
want, isn't it?

548
00:28:58,709 --> 00:28:59,917
Coffee and croissants.

549
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,458
Well, why didn't you
just say so?

550
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,458
I didn't think
it was important.

551
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,792
You don't like those
elaborate meals either.

552
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:10,250
No. I usually prefer
something simple myself,

553
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,583
but I thought you might
enjoy more variety.

554
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,000
Well...

555
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:16,583
I guess it's coffee
and croissants

556
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,792
for both of us
from now on.

557
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:31,667
BOTH:
I love firelight.

558
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:38,458
There's something
about the flame,

559
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,208
the smell of the smoke,

560
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,917
which always
seemed to me to be...

561
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:46,125
intoxicating somehow.

562
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,041
I remember when Jack
and I took Wesley

563
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,625
on his first camping
trip to Balfour Lake.

564
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,500
Wesley kept throwing
<i>manta</i> leaves

565
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,291
into the fire,
watching them pop.

566
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,291
Jack kept telling him...

567
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,583
What?

568
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:09,917
Jean-Luc, I heard you.

569
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,417
Don't push it away.

570
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:16,834
When I said,
"Jack and I",

571
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:21,291
I felt this sudden
wave of... something.

572
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,500
I didn't know
you felt that way.

573
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:31,792
Didn't you?

574
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:38,291
I... I guess I always
knew that there was...

575
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,291
an attraction
between us right from
the start, but...

576
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:44,792
I never knew
how strongly you felt.

577
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:52,250
Why didn't you ever tell me
you were in love with me?

578
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,375
You were married
to my best friend.

579
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,875
At first,
I thought it was...

580
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:02,709
harmless infatuation--

581
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,667
something... hormonal
rather than emotional.

582
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,500
Then, when the months
went by

583
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:12,333
and the three of us
began spending
more time together...

584
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:15,542
I realized that
it was something else,

585
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,625
and it wasn't right.

586
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,959
But although...
I would never act on it

587
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,291
I couldn't help
the way I felt.

588
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:27,458
And when Jack died,
you felt guilty.

589
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:32,125
I felt guilty
before he died...

590
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:35,375
having feelings like that
for my best friend's wife...

591
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:41,834
and then later,
after the accident...

592
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,000
I promised myself

593
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:45,625
that I would never
tell you how I felt.

594
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:48,250
It would be like
betraying my friend.

595
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,458
That's why you
didn't want me

596
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,041
on the<i> Enterprise</i> 
seven years ago.

597
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,458
I didn't know
how I would react.

598
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,959
(<i> sighing</i> )

599
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,333
And then...

600
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:11,667
little by little,
I realized that I...

601
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:14,792
I didn't have
those feelings anymore.

602
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:19,959
20 years is, after all,
a long time.

603
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,000
And now we're friends.

604
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,500
Yes, friends.

605
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,750
Well...

606
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:50,583
we still have
a lot of ground
to cover tomorrow.

607
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,125
We should get
some sleep.

608
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:53,625
Right.

609
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,000
Ambassador,
thank you for coming.

610
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,625
Commander.

611
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,166
We're going to clear up
this misunderstanding

612
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,166
once and for all.

613
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:09,959
Hail Minister Lorin,
please.

614
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,250
Aye, sir.

615
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:14,750
<i>Enterprise,</i>
I have warned you

616
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:16,917
about these unauthorized
communications.

617
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:19,208
Yes, I know,
but I think it's about time

618
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,667
we all sat down together
and tried to work this out.

619
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:23,083
I have Ambassador
Mauric here...

620
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,750
That is<i> your</i> misfortune.

621
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:27,667
We have nothing to say
to either of you.

622
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,417
MAURIC:
Commander, you're
working with the Prytt.

623
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:33,834
Putting on
this little show

624
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,583
for my benefit does
neither of us any good.

625
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:38,792
We'll see.
Mr. Worf?

626
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:44,500
I believe there's someone
waiting for us

627
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,333
in the observation lounge.

628
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,917
I should have known
anyone willing to deal
with the Kes

629
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:58,083
would be capable
of such an outrage.

630
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,458
I'm sorry to resort to such
drastic measures, Minister,

631
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,917
but you left me
little choice.

632
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:03,417
Don't pretend the two
of you are enemies.

633
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:04,709
It's too late
for charades.

634
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,250
If that is
an attempt to hide

635
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,625
your military alliance
with the Federation

636
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,083
you needn't bother.

637
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,166
I already know far more
than you can imagine.

638
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,458
Let's all just sit down
and try to find out

639
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,208
what happened to Captain
Picard and Dr. Crusher.

640
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,500
I will not sit
at a table with<i> him.</i>

641
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:21,959
No more than
I would sit with her.

642
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,500
All right,
then we'll stand.

643
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:26,417
The important thing is
that we start talking.

644
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,834
I am not authorized to
talk with a Kes official.

645
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,417
All right, then,
you talk to me.

646
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,041
Where are
my officers?

647
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,166
As if you don't know
already.

648
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:48,625
Let's go.

649
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,792
I'm all right.

650
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:09,542
We are already
aware of your plan

651
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,083
to use Federation
technology

652
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:13,041
to build new
attack satellites.

653
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,917
You will find that
we are prepared for them.

654
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,625
That is an interesting
but pointless lie.

655
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:18,083
I'd rather discuss
your own plans

656
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,458
to use Federation aid

657
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,083
to stage a takeover
of Kolrod Island.

658
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,917
We have been
over this before.

659
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:25,166
Kolrod clearly belongs
to the Prytt,
who originally...

660
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,000
RIKER:
That's it!

661
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:29,834
I can see that diplomacy

662
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,750
is not going
to get us anywhere today,

663
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:34,291
and I do not have time
to negotiate,

664
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,834
so let's put all of
our cards on the table.

665
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,291
You're concerned
that the Kes

666
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:39,959
are going to be admitted
to the Federation.

667
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,250
Correct.

668
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:43,250
As first officer
of the<i> Enterprise</i>

669
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:45,542
I think I can promise you
that is not going to happen.

670
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,792
The Kes will be
denied membership.

671
00:36:47,834 --> 00:36:49,834
You have no authority
to make that decision.

672
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,875
Despite whatever games
you played with the Prytt
when you arrived,

673
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:54,583
we still plan
to take our petition

674
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,291
directly to
the Federation Council.

675
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,583
They'll listen.

676
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:58,792
They will also listen
to the reports

677
00:36:58,834 --> 00:36:59,959
of the captain
of the<i> Enterprise</i>

678
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,041
and his first officer.

679
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,750
And I can tell you
right now

680
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:05,917
the first officer's report
will go something like this:

681
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:10,792
Kesprytt,
a deeply troubled world--

682
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:13,166
social, political,
military problems

683
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,291
that they have yet
to resolve.

684
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:19,375
The Kes, while a friendly
and democratic people,

685
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:25,250
are driven by suspicion,
deviousness and paranoia.

686
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,250
It is the opinion
of this officer

687
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,041
that they are not ready
for membership.

688
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,834
Now...

689
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,542
...the matter of
our missing officers.

690
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:40,917
They're still charged
with spying, Commander.

691
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,000
I have heard nothing here
which would alter that.

692
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,750
Then maybe you should
consider this.

693
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:47,750
If anything happens to them

694
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:49,709
Starfleet is going to want
a full investigation,

695
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,583
which means more starships
will be coming to Kesprytt

696
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:55,458
and those ships are
going to want answers,

697
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,083
which puts your country
under a very large

698
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,542
and very uncomfortable
microscope.

699
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:02,792
Remember how
unhappy you were

700
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,834
when we contacted just
one of your people

701
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,125
without authorization?

702
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,208
Well, just think what
it'll be like--

703
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,250
<i>ten</i> starships
asking questions,

704
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,083
contacting hundreds
of your people--

705
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,834
massive sensor sweeps.

706
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,792
They may even start
sending down away teams

707
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:20,375
all because<i> you</i> wouldn't help me
find my missing officers.

708
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,333
I think I can use
the tricorder

709
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,375
to set up
a multiphase pulse.

710
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:41,083
That should weaken
the force-field enough
to let us through.

711
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:44,875
No, no, the modulation
frequency

712
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:47,583
is in the upper
harmonic range.
Right.

713
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,291
They're coming.

714
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,583
I'm working
as fast as I can.

715
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:10,542
Minister, we have
the human female.

716
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:13,000
The male is standing
in Kes territory.

717
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,625
Very well. Transmit
their coordinates

718
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:19,709
to the<i> Enterprise</i> 
transporter room.

719
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,250
Understood.

720
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:22,458
Thank you, Minister.

721
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,792
Now, if you'll excuse me.

722
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,000
Mauric is determined
to take his protest

723
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,250
to the Federation Council,

724
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:41,041
but I don't think
he'll get very far.

725
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,083
I tend to agree,
Number One.

726
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:48,375
(<i> chuckling</i> )

727
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:49,709
(<i> laughing</i> )

728
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,375
Did I miss something?

729
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:54,750
Of course,
of course.

730
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:58,792
You're
absolutely right.

731
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:00,208
Ah...

732
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,583
That was wonderful.

733
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:08,959
My pleasure.

734
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,166
Don't get me wrong,
Jean-Luc,

735
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:18,000
but I'm glad we're not
joined at the hip any longer.

736
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,542
So, were you getting
tired of my company?

737
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,208
Just tired of
bumping into you
every 30 seconds.

738
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:30,750
I was beginning to feel

739
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:33,208
as if you were
part of my uniform.

740
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,792
To freedom.

741
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:42,125
Freedom.

742
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,000
Penny
for your thoughts.

743
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:01,333
I was just thinking that,
as distracting as it was,

744
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,917
I was beginning to get used
to hearing your thoughts

745
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:07,208
and I find that I miss it.

746
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,667
So do I.

747
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:10,709
It was very intimate.

748
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:13,458
You know...

749
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,125
last night
I couldn't sleep.

750
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:19,333
Oh?
I was awake
for several hours

751
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:22,667
and, thanks
to the implants,

752
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:26,542
I got to hear
some very interesting
dreams of yours.

753
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,041
A man cannot be
held responsible

754
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:32,625
for what his mind does
while he's asleep.

755
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:35,125
What about
when he's awake?

756
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:48,834
So, now that we've had
this unique experience,

757
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,291
what do we do?

758
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,542
What do you mean?

759
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,583
You know
exactly what I mean.

760
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:55,333
No, I don't.

761
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:58,041
The implants have been
removed, remember?

762
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:09,834
Now that we know
how each of us feels,

763
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:15,000
perhaps we should not be
afraid to explore
those feelings.

764
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:30,041
Or perhaps
we should be afraid.

765
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:38,500
I think I should be
going now.

766
00:42:59,041 --> 00:42:59,959
Good night.

767
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,417
Good night.
