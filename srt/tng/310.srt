00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:07,041
(<i> rooster crows</i> )

2
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,166
Brother John Bates,

3
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:14,291
is that not the morning
which breaks yonder?

4
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,250
I think it be.

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,875
But we have
no great cause

6
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:22,166
to desire
the approach of day.

7
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,667
(<i> rooster crows</i> )

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,667
Who's there?!

9
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:27,959
A friend.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,250
Under what Captain
serve you?

11
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,667
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

12
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,041
I pray you

13
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,083
what thinks he
of our estate?

14
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,834
Even as men wrecked upon a sand

15
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,458
that look to be washed off
at the next tide.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,583
He hath not told
his thought to the king?

17
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,875
No.
Nor it is not meet he should.

18
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:54,125
For though I speak it to you

19
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:59,417
I think the king is...
but a man, as I am.

20
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,375
The violet
smells to him

21
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:04,208
as it doth to me.

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,709
In his nakedness,
he appears but a man.

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,417
Therefore his fears,
out of doubt

24
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,917
be of the same
relish as ours are.

25
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,333
Yet, no man should possess him
with any appearance of fear

26
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:21,667
lest he, by showing it,
should dishearten his army.

27
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,166
He may show
what outward courage he will

28
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,792
but I believe,
as cold a night as 'tis

29
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:28,000
he could wish himself in Thames
up to the neck.

30
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:31,750
Methinks I could not
die anyplace so contented

31
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,542
as in the king's company.

32
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,709
His cause being just

33
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,333
and his quarrel honorable.

34
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,959
That's more than we know.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,250
Or more than we
should seek after.

36
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,041
If his cause be wrong,

37
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:47,250
our obedience to the king
wipes the crime of it out of us.

38
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,333
But if the cause be not good,

39
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,417
the king, himself, have
a heavy reckoning to make

40
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,166
when all those legs and arms and
heads chopped off in a battle

41
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:58,417
shall join together
at the latter day and cry all

42
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,083
"We died at such a place."

43
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,709
The king is not bound to answer

44
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,792
the particular endings
of his soldiers,

45
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:05,000
the father of his son,

46
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,750
nor the master
of his servant.

47
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,083
Splendid, Data, splendid.

48
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,709
You're getting
better and better.

49
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,792
Freeze program.

50
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,041
Thank you, sir.

51
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,709
I plan to study
the performances
of Olivier,

52
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,709
Branagh, Shapiro
and Kullnark.

53
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,625
Data...

54
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:25,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

55
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,375
You're here to learn

56
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:29,500
about the human condition.

57
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:31,834
And there is no better way
of doing that

58
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,709
than by embracing Shakespeare.

59
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,709
But... you must discover it
through your own performance,

60
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,083
not by imitating others.

61
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,709
Riker to Picard.
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

62
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,083
Go ahead, Number One.

63
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,667
Sensors are picking up

64
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,083
a unidentified craft
in the Neutral Zone.

65
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,417
It's heading toward
Federation space.

66
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,125
We're on our way.
Picard out.

67
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:55,417
We'll get to the rest of the act
another time, Data.

68
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,417
Computer, file program
and clear.

69
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,792
Captain, why should a king

70
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,667
wish to pass
as a commoner?

71
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:04,750
If he is the leader,

72
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,458
should he not
be leading?

73
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,083
Listen to what
Shakespeare

74
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,667
is telling you
about the man, Data.

75
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,166
A king who had true
feeling for his soldiers

76
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,625
would wish to share
their fears with them

77
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,625
on the eve of battle.

78
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,542
Sir, will I be able
to schedule

79
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,291
a performance for the crew
in the near future?

80
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,208
Let's not rush
it, shall we?

81
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,625
Hmm.

82
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,667
Outpost Sierra VI
confirms our readings, sir.

83
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,750
They identify it
as a Romulan scoutship.

84
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:41,625
Bearing: 270 mark 14.

85
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,583
Scoutship.

86
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,000
What would a scoutship be doing
this far into the Neutral Zone?

87
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,792
Captain, shall
we transmit

88
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,166
a warning to withdraw, sir?

89
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,667
Open a hailing frequency.

90
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,041
Aye, sir.

91
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,667
Captain, the Romulan
is hailing us.

92
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,041
Visual.

93
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,667
Not within
range, yet.

94
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,208
Open a channel.

95
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,458
Federation ship,
do you read?

96
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,458
I require urgent assistance.

97
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,625
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the USS...

98
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:09,041
Federation ship,
please help me.

99
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,417
Requesting asylum.

100
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,667
Under pursuit.

101
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,208
Pursuit?

102
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,625
Visual range.

103
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,041
On screen, Captain.

104
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:55,875
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

105
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:59,917
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

106
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,792
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

107
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:05,792
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

108
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:10,333
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

109
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:14,792
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

110
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:18,667
Red Alert.

111
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:20,083
Open a channel to the warship.

112
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,166
Come to intercept course.

113
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,458
Keep us out
of the Neutral Zone.

114
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,083
Channel is open.

115
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,500
How long before they cross over
into Federation territory?

116
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:27,834
41 seconds, sir.

117
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:28,834
Romulan warbird,

118
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,333
this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard

119
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,709
of the Federation vessel
<i>Enterprise.</i>

120
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,834
You have crossed
into the Neutral Zone

121
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,083
and are engaged
in hostile action.

122
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,500
Explain yourself
and your intent.

123
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:41,750
No reply, sir.

124
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,166
Hail the scout.

125
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,709
Responding.

126
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,125
On screen.

127
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,583
Federation craft...

128
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,333
please, you must help me!

129
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,417
We are moving to intercept.

130
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,333
Maintain your course and power.

131
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01,208
The scoutship
is severely damaged, sir.

132
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,458
Engines inoperative,
shields are down.

133
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,875
Position?

134
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:07,291
Coordinates 140 by 205, sir.

135
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,667
Federation space.

136
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,250
Right. Move to within
five kilometers.

137
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,625
Mr. La Forge,
prepare to extend

138
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,250
our shields
around the Romulan scoutship.

139
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,166
At that range, the shields
won't be able to take

140
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,417
much punishment, Captain.

141
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,834
Five kilometers, sir.

142
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,458
All stop.

143
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,959
Extend shields.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,417
LA FORGE:
Shields in place.

145
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,709
We've got the scoutship,
Captain.

146
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,000
The weapons on
the warbird are
fully powered, sir.

147
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,250
Lock phasers.
Open a channel.

148
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,417
Ready.

149
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,750
Romulan vessel

150
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:46,041
you are now
in Federation territory.

151
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,000
Unless you withdraw...

152
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,375
No argument?

153
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:54,917
Warbird has re-entered
the Neutral Zone.

154
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,875
Heading
toward Romulan territory.

155
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:59,959
Massive power failure
to the scoutship, sir.

156
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,417
All systems are
going off-line

157
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,709
including
life-support.

158
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,208
Transporter 2,
prepare to beam

159
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,750
the occupant of the scoutship
directly aboard.

160
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:07,750
Aye, sir.

161
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:08,917
Mr. Worf.

162
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,750
Mr. Data,
lock onto the scoutship.

163
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,750
Take it in tow.

164
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:17,959
Energize.

165
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,667
I must see your Captain
immediately.

166
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:36,291
We'll get you
to Sick Bay.

167
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,250
After that...

168
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,709
This cannot wait!

169
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,959
I have information
vital to your survival.

170
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43462.5.</i>

171
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,041
<i>We have beamed aboard</i>
<i>an apparent Romulan defector</i>

172
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,333
<i>who claims to be a low-ranking</i>
<i>logistics officer</i>

173
00:08:56,375 --> 00:09:00,166
<i>with extraordinary information</i>
<i>about a secret offensive.</i>

174
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,625
The humiliating defeat
at the battle of Cheron

175
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,208
has<i> not</i> been forgotten.

176
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,375
The new leaders have vowed
to disregard the treaty

177
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,208
and claim the
Neutral Zone.

178
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,458
Nelvana III is just
the first step.

179
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,917
You're saying an entire base

180
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,625
has already been
established there?

181
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:18,417
Within 48 hours,
the reactor core
will be on-line.

182
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,959
So the Federation sensors
that monitor the Neutral Zone

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,333
just missed it.

184
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,834
It would seem so.

185
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,959
In two days

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,417
a fleet of Romulan warbirds

187
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,291
will be within
striking distance

188
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,166
of 15 Federation sectors.

189
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,041
The Federation
will not permit that.

190
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:43,542
Then it<i> is</i> war that we're
talking about, isn't it?

191
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:50,291
Destroy the base now
and the threat is over.

192
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:54,125
Well, I'm sure you are fatigued
by your ordeal

193
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,000
and you require
medical attention.

194
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,458
Lieutenant Worf

195
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,208
will you conduct Sublieutenant
Setal to the Sick Bay?

196
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,208
We will attend
to your quarters.

197
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,500
No doubt you will wish
to question me further.

198
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,834
No doubt.

199
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,041
He tells a hell of a story.

200
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,625
You don't
believe it?

201
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,208
Well, the Empire knows
that we would never allow them

202
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,041
to build a base
within the Neutral Zone.

203
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,458
Commander, that would not be
an atypical Romulan ploy.

204
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,291
In their long
history of war

205
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,417
the Romulans have
rarely attacked first.

206
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,250
They prefer to test
their enemy's resolve.

207
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,750
RIKER:
I think he's a plant

208
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,542
to draw us
into the Neutral Zone.

209
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,667
That way, we look like
the aggressors.

210
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,250
And the Romulans would have

211
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,667
a legitimate excuse
for responding in force.

212
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:50,667
Exactly.

213
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:51,834
DATA:
That would also

214
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,750
not be an atypical
Romulan ploy, sir.

215
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:57,625
It's always a game
of chess with
them, isn't it?

216
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,625
Well, at least
he's given us

217
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,125
a chance to get a look

218
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,333
at some Romulan
technology close-up.

219
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,417
Mr. La Forge, you will
lead the away team
over to the scout.

220
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,709
Commander, you
and Counselor Troi

221
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,667
will conduct Setal's
interrogation.

222
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,083
Captain, permission to
observe the interrogation.

223
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,834
No, Mr. Data.

224
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,333
I need you
on the bridge with me.
There is much to be done.

225
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,709
We have less than 48 hours
to prevent a war

226
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,041
or, perhaps...

227
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,291
to start one.

228
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,208
This will depend
on establishing the truth...

229
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,542
I set
the autodestruct sequencer

230
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,542
before I left the ship.

231
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,542
Why?

232
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,083
Wouldn't you?

233
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,500
To prevent your ship
from being captured?

234
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,291
Excuse me for being
a little confused, Setal

235
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,500
but I thought
you were defecting.

236
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,500
I am not a traitor.

237
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:57,166
All you can see is
the opportunity to exploit me.

238
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,625
The Federation credo--
exploitation!

239
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,208
Oh, you couldn't get aboard
my ship fast enough, hmm?

240
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,291
Strip it down.

241
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,542
"What secrets might it reveal
that we can use?"

242
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,125
You're shortsighted people.

243
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,000
Can't you understand?

244
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,875
I came to stop a war.

245
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:20,750
If you could
just hold still.

246
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,208
With your metabolism

247
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,250
this will heal
in a few moments.

248
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,333
Thank you, Doctor.

249
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,625
How fortunate

250
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,333
that you know something
of Romulan medicine.

251
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,875
Yes, I had a chance to gain

252
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:43,917
some experience
recently.

253
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:45,125
Oh, yes.

254
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,291
The incident at
the Galorndon Core.

255
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,000
The two officers.

256
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:53,375
You are aware of a great deal
for a logistics<i> clerk.</i>

257
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,333
It was common knowledge.

258
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:02,000
I could show you
my rating code.

259
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:06,041
Forged credentials are
a simple matter for a spy.

260
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:10,250
How do you allow
Klingon<i> pahtk</i>

261
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:14,291
to walk around
in a Starfleet uniform?

262
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,792
You are lucky
this is not a Klingon ship.

263
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,667
We know how to
deal with spies.

264
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:22,000
Remove this<i> tohzah</i>
from my sight.

265
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,959
Your knowledge
of Klingon curses
is impressive,

266
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,625
but, as a Romulan might say,
only a<i> veruul</i> would use

267
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,250
such language
in public.

268
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,750
Mr. Worf please see
to the security arrangements

269
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,834
for our guest's stay.

270
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,583
Aye, sir.

271
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,792
(<i> laughs</i> )

272
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:47,000
You find something
amusing?

273
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,208
Lieutenant Worf--
I like him.

274
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,417
To be more accurate,
I understand him--

275
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,333
a warrior, proud,

276
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,667
fearless, living only
for combat.

277
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,709
Exactly the type
that will get us all killed

278
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,750
if we're not careful.

279
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,041
This is the
food station.

280
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,250
You can reach me
through the com panel.

281
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,041
Later, we would like

282
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,625
to ask you
a few more questions.

283
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,667
Computer, water.

284
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,083
Temperature?

285
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,750
12 onkians.

286
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:40,625
This system is calibrated
to the Celsius metric system.

287
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:42,208
Any temperature at all

288
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,959
on the cold side
of whatever your system is.

289
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,500
(<i> food station beeping</i> )

290
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,750
DATA:
There is no
unusual activity

291
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,750
in the Nelvana
system, sir.

292
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,709
Let's isolate
and magnify that system.

293
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,375
Nothing on
the sensors.

294
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:39,542
It's hard to believe
in what one cannot see,

295
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,750
and yet, conceivably

296
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,709
with their
cloaking technology

297
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,458
a fleet
of Romulan warbirds

298
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,458
could be passing
before our eyes.

299
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,083
There must be some way
to neutralize this advantage.

300
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:57,083
COMPUTER:
Captain Picard, priority one
message from Starfleet

301
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,208
coming in on secured channel.

302
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,875
In my ready room.

303
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,417
Computer, delay time?

304
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,291
Two hours, 22 minute delay
from time of transmission

305
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,083
at Starfleet Command on Lya III.

306
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,709
Computer, key access
412 mark 80.

307
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,959
Picard, Jean-Luc.

308
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,208
Starfleet priority code Gamma.

309
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,542
Decode.

310
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,792
Begin message.

311
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:25,250
Captain, we have received
an official protest

312
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,917
from the Romulan Empire

313
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,458
demanding the return
of your defector.

314
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,625
Obviously, we are
refusing to comply.

315
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:36,500
I join in your skepticism,
but if it is a deception

316
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:40,375
the Romulans are certainly
making a good show of it.

317
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:44,333
The Federation Council has
convened an emergency session.

318
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:48,291
There is no doubt in my mind

319
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,583
that this will eventually fall
on your shoulders, Jean-Luc.

320
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,875
You've got him.

321
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:55,417
You must decide
if he's telling the truth.

322
00:16:55,458 --> 00:17:00,000
For now, I suggest you proceed
along the Neutral Zone border

323
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:04,083
toward a Federation position
proximate to Nelvana III.

324
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,458
Picard to Lieutenant Worf.

325
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,875
Yes, Captain.

326
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:17,333
Please come to my ready room.

327
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,667
Aye, sir.
On my way.

328
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,250
LA FORGE:
Slow playback.

329
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:28,166
Display engine logs
and power data
for both vessels.

330
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:32,000
Now, watch what happens
at 095433 on the clock.

331
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,083
The scout has sustained
engine damage

332
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,208
forcing him to slow
to .615 impulse power.

333
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,583
The warship should overtake
him, but it doesn't.

334
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,125
Now, just 2.6 seconds later,

335
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,625
the warship slows
to precisely the same speed.

336
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,375
Three times, three
speed fluctuations.

337
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:49,291
The warship kept its
distance every time.

338
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,166
I don't think they
wanted to catch up.

339
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,750
And yet they fired
on the scoutship.

340
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,709
They could have
killed him.

341
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,083
Not necessarily, Doctor.

342
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,125
The Romulans have
the same capability

343
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,417
to direct the impact
of their weapons as we do.

344
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,083
Hmm. Is there
a possibility

345
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,458
the wound could be
self-inflicted?

346
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,417
They're very bad burns.
I hardly think...

347
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,583
A possibility.

348
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,500
Yes.

349
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:19,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43463.7.</i>

as well as several independent
vessels in nearby sectors.

358
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:45,041
No one here wants a war,
Captain,

359
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,291
but we are prepared
to take them on

360
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,834
if that is what they want.

361
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,458
All Federation starships

362
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,959
have been placed
on Yellow Alert.

363
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,417
(<i> door chimes</i> )

364
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,083
Come.

365
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,375
You wanted to
see me, Captain?

366
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:02,583
Yes, Data, I want you
to prepare a class-1 probe.

367
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,792
Set the sensors
for maximum scan.

368
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:07,959
I want every meter
of Nelvana III monitored.

369
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,583
I will start my calibrations,
sir.

370
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,709
Data...

371
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:18,166
Is there something else
you require of me, Captain?

372
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,417
Your clarity of thought.

373
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:25,625
Your objectivity, as always.

374
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,125
Sit down.

375
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:35,667
Data, it's very possible
that we are about to go to war.

376
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:40,000
The repercussions of what we do
during the next 24 hours

377
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,375
may be felt for years to come.

378
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:45,750
I want you to keep a record
of these events

379
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,417
so that history
will have the benefit

380
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,583
of... a dispassionate view.

381
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,041
I will begin immediately, sir.

382
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,750
Is that all?

383
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:57,083
How is the crew's spirit?

384
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,750
They are
concerned,

385
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:01,458
of course, Captain,
but confident.

386
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,959
Do you not see that, sir?

387
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,959
Data, unlike King Henry,

388
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,709
it is not easy for me
to disguise myself

389
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,041
and walk among my troops.

390
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,792
That'll be all.

391
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,625
"Now if these men
do not die well

392
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:35,500
"it will be a black matter
for the king

393
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,542
who led them to it."

394
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,583
Why must we waste time
playing this ridiculous game?

395
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,500
There's more here than
you're telling us.

396
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,125
You're forcing yourself
to hold back.

397
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,417
I have told you
everything relevant

398
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,792
about Nelvana III.

399
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,166
I'm not talking
about the base.

400
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,208
The base is all that matters.

401
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,750
You're lying, Setal.

402
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:57,709
Go to Nelvana III
and you will see.

403
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,000
We're not going anywhere
until we get to the truth.

404
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,083
You're a spy, aren't you?

405
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,041
No.

406
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,709
Then prove it.

407
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,583
You can begin by telling me
something about the location

408
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,083
and the strength
of the Romulan fleet.

409
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,041
I don't know it.

410
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,291
You're a logistics officer.

411
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,709
For one sector only.

412
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,417
Who was your superior officer?
Admiral Jarok.

413
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,875
The location
of the Romulan bases

414
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:14,875
along the Neutral Zone?

415
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:15,917
I don't know.

416
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,500
In your sector?
Irrelevant!

417
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,250
The number of troops
under your admiral's command?

418
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,250
Irrelevant! Irrelevant!

419
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,333
I guess you're right.

420
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,333
It's not worth
playing this game.

421
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,917
Oh, what a fool I've been--

422
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:38,375
to come looking for courage
in the lair of cowards.

423
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,500
COMPUTER:
Captain Picard, priority message

424
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:49,250
from Security Officer,
Klingon vessel<i> Bortas.</i>

425
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,792
Mr. Worf, will you handle this
at security station, deck nine?

426
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:54,583
Aye, sir.

427
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,917
Sensors are configured
for planetary probe, sir.

428
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,417
Ready for launch.

429
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,083
Proceed.

430
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,291
Probe on course.

431
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,834
Sensors are functioning.

432
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,792
Coordinate your analysis
with Mr. La Forge.

433
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,208
I want this report
with dispatch.

434
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,667
I don't know, Data.

435
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:23,375
My gut tells me
we ought to be listening

436
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,375
to what this guy's
trying to tell us.

437
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,583
Your "gut"?

438
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,875
It's just a...
a feeling, you know--

439
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,542
an instinct, intuition.

440
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,583
But those qualities
would interfere

441
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,750
with rational judgment,
would they not?

442
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:36,542
You're right,
sometimes they do.

443
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:40,041
Then why not rely strictly
on the facts?

444
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,041
Because you just can't rely
on the plain and simple facts.

445
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,750
Sometimes they lie.

446
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,625
They can lead
to the wrong conclusions,

447
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,750
but they cannot lie.

448
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:52,709
Yeah? Well, what
do you think?

449
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,583
Is he a defector or not?

450
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,000
The facts to date would lead

451
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,041
to the objective conclusion
that he is not.

452
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,583
Well... somehow I think

453
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,625
we're going to catch the
Romulans with their pants down

454
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:04,834
on Nelvana III,
just like he says.

455
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,166
"With their pants...?"

456
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,583
A metaphor.

457
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,750
Catching them in the act.

458
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,959
Because your gut
tells you so.

459
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,291
Exactly.

460
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,208
But you can't always
go with your gut, either.

461
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,375
It's...

462
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,875
Well, it's
a combination, Data.

463
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:25,959
All right, I'll put it to you
this way.

464
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,250
All these feelings that get
in the way of human judgment,

465
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,000
that confuse the hell out of us,

466
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,333
that make us
second-guess ourselves--

467
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:34,875
well, we need them.

468
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:36,375
We need them to...

469
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:37,875
help us fill in
the missing pieces

470
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,250
because we almost never
have all the facts.

471
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,458
So a person fills in
the missing pieces of the puzzle

472
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,792
with his own personality,
resulting in a conclusion

473
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:55,166
based as much
on instinct
and intuition

474
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,333
as on fact.

475
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,917
Now you're getting it.

476
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,166
Hmm.

477
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,875
But what does one do

478
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:06,333
if he has no instinct
or intuition?

479
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,417
Data, look at this.

480
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:13,792
The facts just took
a left turn.

481
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:16,834
DATA:
As the probe went into
orbit around Nelvana III,

482
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,917
it began picking up
low-level subspace
radio emissions.

483
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,417
Could they be
naturally occurring?

484
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,500
No, sir, the patterns
are clearly artificial.

485
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:26,166
The signal was so faint,

486
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,291
our ship's sensors
couldn't read it
from this distance.

487
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,834
Can we decode it?

488
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,125
We've tried.

489
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,041
It's probably Romulan,
but we can't be sure.

490
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,458
We've also picked up
ionization disturbances.

491
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,750
Cloaked Romulan ships
could produce that effect.

492
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:42,000
What about
the planet's surface?

493
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:44,375
Reading nothing
but barren rock.

494
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:47,000
I don't know.
They might be able to hide
a base from our probe.

495
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,834
Its capabilities
are limited.

496
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,041
The only way
we'll know for sure

497
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:54,208
is if we go down
and take a look
for ourselves.

498
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,375
That'll be all, gentlemen.

499
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:22,709
I take it, you
have never seen
a Romulan before.

500
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,875
That would be
an incorrect assumption.

501
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:29,291
Then why do you invade
my privacy?

502
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:33,625
I was attempting to ascertain
what my guts tell me about you.

503
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:43,083
You're the android.

504
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,625
I know a host
of Romulan cyberneticists

505
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:48,458
that would love to be

506
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,041
this close to you.

507
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:54,083
I do not find that concept
particularly appealing.

508
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:56,959
Nor should you.

509
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,333
I am told
by various crew members

510
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:07,125
that this viewport is
their favorite on the ship.

511
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,166
Hmm.

512
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:13,417
I thought it would bring me
some comfort,

513
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:16,333
but these are not my stars.

514
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,917
Even the heavens
are denied me here.

515
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:25,458
Oh... synthetic swill.

516
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:30,041
I don't suppose
your food terminals

517
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:33,834
would be capable
of producing a Romulan ale?

518
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,375
I am afraid that would require

519
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:38,000
the molecular structure
of the beverage in question.

520
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,875
And, as you are no doubt aware

521
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:42,667
our knowledge of your planet
is quite limited.

522
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:44,750
The loss is yours.

523
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:50,291
For I have visited
over a hundred different worlds

524
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:56,041
and none possessed
the awesome beauty of Romulus.

525
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,750
Am I correct in assuming

526
00:26:57,792 --> 00:27:00,166
you regret your decision
to come here?

527
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:04,750
What I did had to be done,

528
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:09,250
but... never again

529
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:14,792
to see the firefalls
at Gal Gath'thong

530
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:17,750
and the spires of my home

531
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:22,000
as they rise
above the Apnex Sea at dawn.

532
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:27,000
It's a bitter thing
to be exiled from your own home.

533
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:29,959
It does appear
unlikely

534
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,834
you will ever be allowed
to return to your planet.

535
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:37,959
The cold reaction
of an android.

536
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:45,834
But perhaps we can bring Romulus
to you.

537
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,917
COMPUTER:
Program complete.

538
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,875
Run program.

539
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,875
After you.

540
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:16,917
The Valley of Chula.

541
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:19,417
I know it well.

542
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:24,083
You are free to stay here
as long as you wish.

543
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,875
I no longer live here.

544
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,917
Turn it off.

545
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,208
Cancel program.

546
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,959
This...

547
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,291
this is my home now,
my future.

548
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,875
I have sacrificed everything.

549
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:51,875
It must not be in vain.

550
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:55,250
Arrange a meeting between
myself and Captain Picard.

551
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:04,709
Tell him Admiral Jarok
wants to see him.

552
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,709
Captain, we have confirmed

553
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,709
that you are holding
Admiral Alidar Jarok.

554
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,834
He has been identified
as the commander

555
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,917
at the massacre
of the Norkan outposts.

556
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:23,667
The council strongly advises
that you consider Jarok

557
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:26,208
an unreliable source
of information.

558
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:35,458
Bring him in.

559
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:40,583
Ensign, will you
wait outside?

560
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,000
Have a seat,
Admiral Jarok.

561
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,583
Captain, there is
no more time.

562
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,959
Admiral,
have a seat.

563
00:29:56,333 --> 00:30:01,583
You see, I'm just not convinced
that you are telling the truth.

564
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,333
What must I do?

565
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:07,250
You must convince me.

566
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:11,709
If I had irrefutable evidence...

567
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,625
but you did not bring
irrefutable evidence.

568
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,583
You brought no evidence at all.

569
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:19,709
And now I hear you are not
the man you claimed to be.

570
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,041
Admiral...

571
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:25,834
your credibility
is stretched
beyond belief.

572
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:31,166
A Romulan defector is almost
a contradiction in terms.

573
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:34,250
But Admiral Jarok
crossing the lines?

574
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:38,000
I explained my motivations
to your interrogators.

575
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:41,834
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes--
peace in our galaxy.

576
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:44,667
Except, Admiral,
you are not a man of peace.

577
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:48,125
Your military record,
what we know of it, is clear.

578
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:52,458
Which is precisely why I chose
an alternate identity here.

579
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,834
The massacres in the Norkan
outposts, for example.

580
00:30:55,875 --> 00:31:00,250
What you call "massacres"
were called

581
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:05,500
the "Norkan campaigns"
on my world, Captain.

582
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:10,125
One world's butcher
is another world's hero.

583
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,959
Perhaps I am neither one.

584
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:20,709
On what basis, Admiral,
am I to decide?

585
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,542
Hmm?

586
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:26,750
Your good word?

587
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:29,583
Are you willing
to help us overpower

588
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:33,125
the Romulan B-Type warbirds
we may encounter?

589
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:36,417
Are you prepared
to help us detect them

590
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,834
through their
cloaking shields?

591
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:45,583
Well, you see
my problem, Admiral.

592
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:48,500
You ask us for faith

593
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:52,166
in circumstances which are
hardly possible to believe

594
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:55,291
compounded by lies
and your refusal to tell us

595
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:56,417
what you know.

596
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,709
I cannot betray my people.

597
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,834
You've already betrayed
your people, Admiral.

598
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,208
You've made your choices, sir.

599
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,125
You're a traitor.

600
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,709
Now, if the bitter taste of that
is unpalatable to you,

601
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,000
I am truly sorry.

602
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,250
But I will not
risk my crew

603
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:15,583
because you think you can dance
on the edge of the Neutral Zone.

604
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:19,000
You've crossed
over, Admiral.

605
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:23,333
You make yourself comfortable
with that.

606
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:30,291
Do you... have any children,
Captain Picard, a family?

607
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:33,000
No.

608
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:39,667
Oh. Then you have sacrificed
too much for your career.

609
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:42,792
Yes, this is all
very interesting...

610
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:45,709
There comes a time
in a man's life

611
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,291
that you cannot know

612
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:51,250
when he looks down at the first
smile of his baby girl

613
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:56,500
and realizes he must change
the world for her--

614
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:59,417
for all children.

615
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:02,625
It is for her that I am here.

616
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:07,834
Not to destroy the Romulan
Empire, but to save it.

617
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:10,041
For months

618
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:14,166
I tried desperately
to persuade the High Command

619
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:17,709
that another war
would destroy the Empire.

620
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,625
They got tired of my arguments.

621
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:21,667
Finally, I was censured,

622
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:23,959
sent off to command
some distant sector.

623
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,208
This was my only recourse.

624
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,125
I...

625
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:37,750
will never see
my child smile again.

626
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,625
She will grow up
believing

627
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:45,417
that her father is a traitor.

628
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:48,625
But she will grow up...

629
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:49,875
if you act, Picard,

630
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:54,750
if we stop
this war before it begins.

631
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:58,917
I can't and I won't...

632
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:03,750
unless I have
unequivocal cooperation.

633
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:26,625
Admiral Jarok has provided me
with the locations, strengths

634
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:30,208
and tactical plans
of the Romulan fleet.

635
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,750
Mr. La Forge, he is prepared

636
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:36,625
to give you data
regarding engines,

637
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,834
weapons, and the
cloaking systems

638
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,166
of the warbird
class starship.

639
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,792
But I believe

640
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:46,000
his experience as a field
commander will be more valuable

641
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:49,000
for its strategic sense
than in the technical areas.

642
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:50,917
Any edge will help, Captain.

643
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,166
Don't depend on this.

644
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,417
For all we know,
he may be still lying,

645
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,125
but we shall find that out
soon enough.

646
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:56,083
Number One,

647
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:58,417
set course for Nelvana III.

648
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:07,875
DATA:
<i>Second Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43465.2.</i>

649
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:09,750
<i>We have entered</i>
<i>the Neutral Zone</i>

650
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:12,625
<i>in direct violation</i>
<i>of the Treaty of Algeron.</i>

651
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:15,917
<i>Presuming Romulan warships</i>
<i>are cloaked and monitoring us,</i>

652
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:17,625
<i>we expect heavy resistance</i>

653
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:19,583
<i>as we approach Nelvana III.</i>

654
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:20,542
Tactical?

655
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:21,792
Nothing on sensors.

656
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:23,959
I don't like it.

657
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,667
I would have expected
a greeting party.

658
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:29,333
You echo
another noteworthy commander

659
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,125
in similar circumstances,
Number One.

660
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:33,333
A countryman
of yours--

661
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:34,875
George Armstrong Custer

662
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:38,625
when his Seventh Cavalry
arrived at The Little Bighorn.

663
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,291
May we have better luck.

664
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:42,333
Approaching Nelvana system.

665
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,542
Engage impulse engines.

666
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,458
Nelvana III on screen.

667
00:35:57,834 --> 00:36:00,542
Still no signs of them
on sensors.

668
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:04,125
In a way, I'd rather be fighting
my way through this.

669
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:05,709
It's just too damned easy.

670
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,166
Prepare to enter
standard orbit.

671
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:15,333
Data?

672
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,500
Scanning
the planet, sir.

673
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:21,041
No life forms, no power sources,
no weapons systems.

674
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,041
No indication
of a base at all?

675
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,417
DATA:
No, sir.

676
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:27,125
The subspace signal
the probe detected?

677
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,291
The ionization
disturbances?

678
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,709
DATA:
I am picking them up, sir

679
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,834
but I cannot identify
the source.

680
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:36,291
They seem to be moving
in an orbital path

681
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:39,208
with an 800-kilometer apogee.

682
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:45,041
Lieutenant Worf,
bring the Admiral up here.

683
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,375
Aye, sir.

684
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,333
Maybe they abandoned the planet
after he defected.

685
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:55,375
There is no scarring
on the planet surface

686
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:58,291
that would denote heavy
construction of any kind.

687
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:01,166
A cloaking device of some sort
to hide the entire base?

688
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,667
A cloaking device
operating on the surface

689
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:06,375
would be given away
by visible distortion effects.

690
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,542
Perhaps you would care
to explain

691
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:16,333
why we are here, Admiral.

692
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,875
There doesn't appear
to be a base.

693
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,041
I don't understand.

694
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:27,709
PICARD:
Nelvana III, Admiral!
No base!

695
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,875
No weapons!

696
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:31,291
No sign of any life at all!

697
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:41,125
I-I saw
the tactical communiqués--

698
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:45,375
the records,
timetables for completion.

699
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:49,333
An entire legion
was assigned to this section.

700
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:53,667
Is it possible they could have
been feeding you disinformation?

701
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,500
You said
that you had been censured--

702
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:01,333
reassigned four months ago.

703
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,917
They knew
of your dissatisfaction.

704
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:08,041
Could all this have been
to test your loyalty?

705
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:11,333
No.

706
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,750
No!

707
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,750
It's impossible.

708
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,750
They let you escape

709
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:31,750
with an arsenal
of worthless secrets.

710
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:34,834
What other explanation
is there?

711
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,834
Permission to withdraw
from the Neutral Zone.

712
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:38,500
At your earliest convenience,
Number One.

713
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:40,834
Helm, bring her around
180 degrees!

714
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:43,417
Geordi,
get us out of here!

715
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,667
GEORDI:
I hear you, Commander.

716
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,083
Two Romulan warships
uncloaking.

717
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,291
Coordinates...

718
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:06,208
Shields holding.

719
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,667
Damage?

720
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:09,208
La FORGE:
Minor damage
to the secondary hull.

721
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,291
Power transfer fields
may be pinched off.

722
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,667
I'm working on it.

723
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:15,000
Captain?

724
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,083
Not yet, Mr. Worf.

725
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,625
This is just a tap
on the shoulder

726
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:22,250
or we wouldn't be here
talking about it.

727
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:24,500
The Romulans
are hailing us.

728
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:25,959
On screen.

729
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,792
TOMALAK:
Captain Picard,

730
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:31,250
I hardly expected
to see you again so soon.

731
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:33,834
It seems this time
<i>you</i> are the one

732
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:37,166
who has made an aggressive move
across the Neutral Zone.

733
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,291
Commander Tomalak,
as I am sure you already know,

734
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,333
we were responding
to warnings

735
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:45,041
of Romulan incursions
at Nelvana III.

736
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:50,250
But, Captain, as you can see,
there is no incursion.

737
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,542
And the matter
of the unidentified

738
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:56,333
subspace radio emissions
and the ionization disturbances?

739
00:39:56,375 --> 00:40:00,417
Oh, you must mean
our orbiting probe.

740
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:06,458
We are studying Nelvana III
for... archaeological research.

741
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,291
With a cloaked satellite?

742
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:12,667
Oh, really, Captain,
would you have us believe

743
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:14,583
this satellite is an excuse

744
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:17,166
for your aggressive charge
across the Neutral Zone?

745
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,500
You can believe
what you wish,

746
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,417
and we will be on our way.

747
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,291
Without even an apology,
Captain?

748
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:28,041
If an apology will do,
then I offer it.

749
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,208
I'm afraid it won't,

750
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,875
so I will save you
the humiliation.

751
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:33,792
Get to it, Tomalak!

752
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:37,417
You see, Picard,
after we dissect your<i> Enterprise</i>

753
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:40,417
for every precious bit
of information,

754
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:43,125
I intend to display
its broken hull

755
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,959
in the center
of the Romulan capitol

756
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,709
as a symbol of our victory.

757
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,291
It will inspire our armies
for generations to come

758
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,834
and serve as a warning
to any other traitor

759
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:55,333
who would create ripples
of disloyalty.

760
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:05,583
All the communiqués,
all the timetables,

761
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:08,959
all the records--
they were all fiction

762
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,917
written
for my benefit.

763
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:12,500
A test...

764
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:15,834
a test of my loyalty.

765
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:19,917
And you used me
to lure the<i> Enterprise</i>

766
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:22,333
into the
Neutral Zone.

767
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:28,291
First, Captain, you will
return the traitor, Jarok.

768
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:32,041
Then you will surrender
as prisoners of war.

769
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:34,917
Do you seriously expect me
to accept those terms?

770
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:41,625
No, Captain Picard,
I expect you won't.

771
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:45,333
You have 30 seconds to decide.

772
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,667
I do not require
one, Tomalak.

773
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:52,500
I urge you, Captain Picard--
surrender.

774
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:55,542
Consider the men and women
you would lead

775
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,959
into a lost cause.

776
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:05,333
If the cause is just
and honorable,

777
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:07,917
they are prepared
to give their lives.

778
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,625
Are you prepared
to die today, Tomalak?

779
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:16,000
I expected more from you
than an idle threat, Picard.

780
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:19,083
Then you shall have it.

781
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,625
Mr. Worf.

782
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,583
Aye, sir.

783
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:34,667
Klingon warships--
armed and ready, sir.

784
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,875
What shall it
be, Tomalak?

785
00:42:39,917 --> 00:42:44,083
You will still not survive
our assault.

786
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:47,208
And you will not survive ours.

787
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,291
Shall we die together?

788
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:56,667
I look forward to our
next meeting, Captain.

789
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:03,125
Romulan disrupters
are powering down, sir.

790
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:11,709
Cancel Red Alert.

791
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,417
Mr. Worf, will
you extend

792
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,667
the appreciation
of the Federation

793
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:20,583
and my personal gratitude
to the Klingons.

794
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,667
Aye, sir.

795
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:28,000
Take us back,
Number One.

796
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:32,583
I did it for nothing.

797
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:37,125
My home, my family...

798
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:39,500
for nothing.

799
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:52,625
He ingested
a Felodesine chip.

800
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,709
He must have
brought it with him.

801
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,709
I'm sorry, Captain,
there was no antidote.

802
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:03,542
A letter to his wife
and daughter.

803
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:07,250
Sir, he must have known
it would be impossible

804
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:10,959
for us to deliver it.

805
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,041
Today, perhaps,

806
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,959
but if there are others

807
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,166
with the courage
of Admiral Jarok,

808
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:19,834
we may hope to see
a day of peace

809
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:25,166
when we<i> can</i>
take his letter home.
