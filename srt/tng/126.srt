1
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:05,959
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41986.0.</i>

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,834
<i>We are awaiting the return</i>
<i>of Captain Picard</i>

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,125
<i>who was summoned</i>
<i>to Starbase 7-1-8</i>

4
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:11,750
<i>for an emergency conference.</i>

5
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:13,750
<i>Meanwhile, our sensors</i>
<i>have been monitoring</i>

6
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:15,959
<i>an ancient capsule floating in</i>
<i>our vicinity,</i>

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,458
<i>which appears to</i>
<i>be from Earth.</i>

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,583
I wonder how it got out here.

9
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,750
At its present speed and heading
it will eventually enter

10
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:24,375
the Kazis
binary system

11
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:26,250
and will certainly
be destroyed.

12
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,041
I could attach a tractor beam
and adjust its heading.

13
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,333
I think not, Mr. Worf.

14
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,959
It's just a piece
of space debris.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,375
If we hadn't been sitting here,
waiting for the Captain

16
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:34,834
we wouldn't have noticed it.

17
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,041
Let it be.

18
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,875
Let nature
take its course.

19
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:39,792
How long until
Captain Picard returns?

20
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:41,041
The last
communication

21
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,750
indicated it would
be several hours.

22
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,125
Commander--

23
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,250
request permission to
investigate this vehicle.

24
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,250
Why, Data?

25
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,250
It's just a derelict.

26
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,750
It is a piece
of history.

27
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,750
The opportunity to examine
such an ancient vehicle

28
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:52,792
does not come around

29
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:53,750
very often.

30
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:54,750
And, as you
pointed out

31
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,792
we do have the time.

32
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:58,333
Very well.

33
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,959
Be prepared to beam back
before the Captain returns.

34
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,125
Thank you, sir.

35
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,917
Lieutenant Worf,
go with him.

36
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,166
Aye, sir.

37
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,250
Minimal oxygen
atmosphere.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,625
An ancient
solar generator--

39
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,166
still operating.

40
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:36,417
WORF:
Commander,
look at this.

41
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:41,500
The on-board computers
have ceased functioning.

42
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:44,000
I may be able to download
this old-style disk drive

43
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,500
back to
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

44
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:47,083
(<i> beeping</i> )

45
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,208
(<i> distant clanging</i> )

46
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:54,500
(<i> grunting</i> )

47
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,250
Must be
sealed.

48
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,959
Probably
with age.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,750
Ah, not necessary.

50
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:41,834
The seal has been broken

51
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,458
and the environment corrupted.

52
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,208
Here's another.

53
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,000
This one is empty.

54
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,250
Commander

55
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,834
look
at this.

56
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:42,750
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

57
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:47,125
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

58
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,667
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

59
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,792
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

60
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:57,417
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

61
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:01,041
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

62
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,125
Were they frozen for
an extended journey?

63
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,750
If that were the purpose,
there would be evidence

64
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:34,417
of a more sophisticated
monitoring system.

65
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,125
These containers were designed
solely for refrigeration.

66
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,667
The Captain's shuttle
is approaching

67
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,041
the main Shuttle Bay, sir.

68
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,583
<i>Enterprise,</i>
this is the Captain.

69
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,834
Number One,
I want to get underway

70
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,291
as soon as the shuttle
is secure.

71
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,291
Aye, sir.

72
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,667
We'll make all preparations.

73
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:49,750
Commander Data--
return to the<i> Enterprise,</i>

74
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,291
immediately.

75
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,625
DATA:
We have run into
an unusual situation, sir.

76
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,417
There are people on board--

77
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,792
frozen.

78
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,667
Frozen? How many?

79
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,000
Three.

80
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,208
The vehicle has suffered
severe damage.

81
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,750
Most of her systems
have failed.

82
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:08,083
Are you suggesting they be
transferred to the<i> Enterprise?</i>

83
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:11,542
I do not believe we should
leave them here, sir.

84
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,959
With your permission

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,291
we will be returning
with three containers.

86
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,041
RIKER:
Whatever you do, do it quickly.

87
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,500
Mr. La Forge, set course
zero-five-eight

88
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:27,709
mark one-seven-three.

89
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,917
Laying
it in, sir.

90
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,041
Number One,
I want a staff meeting

91
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,709
on the Observation Deck.

92
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,500
Captain

93
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:34,583
those coordinates will take us

94
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,834
right into the
Neutral Zone.

95
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,458
That is correct, Mr. La Forge.

96
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,250
Warp factor eight.

97
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,041
Aye, sir. Warp eight.

98
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,417
Engage.

99
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,959
Two Federation outposts
in sector three-zero

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
have been destroyed.

101
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,458
There's been no communication

102
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,083
with Federation starbases
in sector three-one

103
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:09,709
since Stardate 41903.2.

104
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,667
Romulans.

105
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:13,125
That's the assumption.

106
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,542
There's been
no direct contact
with the Romulans

107
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,959
since the Tomed incident.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,792
The questions are: why now?

109
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,959
What's their
objective?

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,583
For 50 years, there's barely
a whisper out of them

111
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,792
and now, for no apparent reason

112
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:28,709
they seem to be back
with a roar.

113
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,375
Everything we know about them
is based on rumor

114
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,667
or conjecture.

115
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:36,083
The strategic decision

116
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,583
is to send one ship.

117
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,917
The<i> Enterprise.</i>

118
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,458
We could get out there
and find ourselves

119
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,250
greatly overmatched.

120
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,291
True enough.

121
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,458
It's a gamble.

122
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,959
This first encounter--

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,792
coming so suddenly
after all this time--

124
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,917
we have to assume it's a setup.

125
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,834
If force is necessary,
we will use it

126
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,542
but that will mean
we have failed.

127
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,875
Our goal here is to establish
some kind of relations

128
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,291
with the Romulans.

129
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,709
If we don't
succeed

130
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,959
then, to convince them
of our resolve.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The general feeling at Starfleet
is that they are seeking

132
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,625
confrontation.

133
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:08,750
They may want

134
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,583
to test themselves
in battle

135
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,333
against a Federation starship.

136
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,125
See how far we have advanced.

137
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,959
If that is the case,
then I need to know it.

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,291
Counselor, I
shall need a full
profile on them.

139
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,583
There is limited information

140
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,834
but I will
prepare something.

141
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,083
Computer, estimated time
of arrival at the Neutral Zone?

142
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,667
19 hours, 28 minutes.

143
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:32,208
Let's reassemble
in six hours.

144
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,875
Stay sharp, no surprises.

145
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:37,291
I would rather outthink them
than outfight them.

146
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,667
Questions?

147
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,208
What is it,
Doctor?

148
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,166
It's the people
from the capsule.

149
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,000
Capsule? People?
What people?

150
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,750
The people
Data beamed over.

151
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,000
I wasn't aware
that he had.

152
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,375
Well, he did

153
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,959
and they were frozen.

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,500
I thawed them.

155
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:01,917
You what?

156
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,542
Well, I didn't know
what else to do.

157
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,875
The crypts
in which they were frozen

158
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,500
were literally falling apart.

159
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:09,166
So, what's their condition?

160
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,500
Right now, they're all sleeping.

161
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,792
Each of them needed
minor medical attention.

162
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,000
Minor now but, then,

163
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,333
their conditions
were obviously terminal.

164
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,208
One had a heart problem

165
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,125
another, an advance
case of emphysema

166
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,542
with extensive
liver damage.

167
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,375
You know, the most surprising
thing of all

168
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:30,750
is that each of them had been
frozen<i> after</i> they died.

169
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:32,583
After they died?

170
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,375
Cryonics.

171
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:37,417
It was a kind of fad
in the late 20th century.

172
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,583
People feared
dying.

173
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,709
It terrified them.

174
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,041
So, at the moment of death

175
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,417
they would be frozen

176
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,000
so that later,
sometime in the future

177
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,333
presumably, when
medical science
had found a cure

178
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,041
for whatever
killed them--

179
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,250
they could be
thawed back to life, healed

180
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,917
and sent on
about their business.

181
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,917
Well, in the case of this group,
it apparently worked.

182
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,291
Mr. Data, will you report
to Sick Bay...

183
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,625
...immediately.

184
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:17,834
Look, I am
never critical

185
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:22,333
of any member of
my staff being
curious, but...

186
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,041
it's just that
the timing is so...

187
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,667
I could not
leave them there, Captain.

188
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,917
The condition of their vehicle
was deteriorating.

189
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:31,208
But, Data,
they were already dead.

190
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,208
I mean, what more could have
happened to them?

191
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,834
I see your point,
Captain

192
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,917
but, at the time, it seemed
the proper thing to do.

193
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,458
Well, they're
alive now.

194
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,834
We're going to have to treat
them as living human beings.

195
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,667
Alive and well and ready
to be awakened.

196
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:50,834
Look, before you
wake them up

197
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,417
I want to have
security here.

198
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,041
Lieutenant Worf,
report to Sick Bay.

199
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,542
I have them
sedated now

200
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,500
but they should be
up and about

201
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:58,709
as soon as
possible.

202
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:04,917
Well, then we have
no other choice.

203
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,792
None that
I can see.

204
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,959
Welcome to the 24th century.

205
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,750
I was able to retrieve
some information

206
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,500
from the ancient disk I removed
from the module's computer.

207
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:12,083
Her name
is Clare Raymond--

208
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,458
age 35

209
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,834
occupation,
homemaker.

210
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,875
Must be some kind
of construction work.

211
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,458
She died of an embolism.

212
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,166
It probably happened
very suddenly.

213
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,291
Otherwise, her physical
condition was excellent.

214
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,500
His name is
Ralph Offenhouse--

215
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:38,542
age, 55;
occupation, financier.

216
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,709
Advanced
cardiomyopathy.

217
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,000
Inoperable
at the time

218
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,125
but easily
correctable now.

219
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,625
He must have known
his condition was terminal

220
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:49,500
for quite
some time.

221
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:52,792
Much of his file, we
could not retrieve.

222
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:55,458
His name is
L.Q. Sonny Clemonds.

223
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,458
Apparently, his occupation
had something to do with music.

224
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,875
CRUSHER:
There was marked deterioration
in every system of his body.

225
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:04,041
Probably from massive
chemical abuse.

226
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,583
Unbelievable.

227
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,458
Sounds like someone
who hated life

228
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,208
yet he had himself
frozen, presumably

229
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,625
so he could go
through it all again.

230
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:15,417
Too afraid to live,
too scared to die.

231
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,166
Well, Doctor, this
seems to be a situation

232
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,542
more suited
to your talents.

233
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,583
I'll leave it
with you.

234
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,917
I'll be on the Bridge.

235
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:32,208
Number One, kindly
take charge of our guests

236
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,417
until we have time to decide

237
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,709
what we are going
to do with them.

238
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,709
Aye, sir.

239
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,000
And, Number One--

240
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,542
keep them out
of my way.

241
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,583
I know this is all
very confusing to you

242
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,667
so I'll attempt
to explain.

243
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,834
You are on

244
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,792
the starship USS<i> Enterprise</i>

245
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:57,834
American?

246
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:58,959
No, it's a vessel

247
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,125
of the United Federation
of Planets

248
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,041
and Earth is
a member.

249
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,542
Uh, what year is this?

250
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,625
By your
calendar--

251
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,333
2364.

252
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,208
What?

253
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,834
My heart, is it...

254
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,667
It's perfectly fine.

255
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:21,417
In fact, all of you
are now in excellent health.

256
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,917
It worked.

257
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,417
I made it.

258
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,083
What is that?

259
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,041
An android.

260
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,291
You mean a robot?

261
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,792
Actually, there is
a distinct difference

262
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:40,250
between an android and a robot.

263
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:44,792
And him-- the one
I saw before with the head?

264
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:47,542
She means Worf.

265
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,917
He's a Klingon.

266
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,750
That takes a little more
explanation.

267
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,166
Now, listen, guys.

268
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,458
I paid some idiot
a lot of money

269
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,083
to freeze me
when I died

270
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,000
and I just got to hear
the words.

271
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,333
Am I alive?

272
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,166
Oh, yes, absolutely.

273
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,458
And the liver that was
about to explode in my face?

274
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,250
Perfectly sound.

275
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,834
Excuse me.

276
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,417
Could someone please tell me
what's going on here?

277
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:16,000
About 370 years ago,
you died of a massive embolism.

278
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,875
I don't remember anything
about that.

279
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:23,709
You and the others were frozen.

280
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:29,083
Cryonics-- you know, it's freeze
you now and heal you later.

281
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,250
Yeah, I've heard of it.

282
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,375
I just never gave it
much thought.

283
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:34,959
How did we get here?

284
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,875
You were in a space module.

285
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:38,750
The whacko that sold
me this scam said

286
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,250
that by putting us in orbit

287
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,583
there wasn't going to be
no chance of a brownout.

288
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:46,000
Yes, several cryonics companies
fell into disrepute

289
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,709
because of power failures

290
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,667
which adversely affected
their refrigeration system.

291
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:53,166
Their stocks were
severely depressed.

292
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,875
The whole deal was a long shot

293
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,291
but, I figured, what the hell

294
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,709
might as well
give them the dough

295
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,542
instead of leaving it
to my ex-wives.

296
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,959
(<i> Sonny laughs</i> )

297
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,166
But, you know, son,
I just figured

298
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,083
it was all a bunch of hooey.

299
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,500
"Hooey?"

300
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,959
Ah, as in hogwash,
malarkey, jive--

301
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,667
an intentional fabrication.

302
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:14,709
There you go.

303
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,959
Now you got it.

304
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,834
Now, if you didn't contract
for this, who did?

305
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,625
It must have been
my husband, Donald.

306
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:27,834
If it was new and foolish,
he would have popped for it.

307
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,500
Well, I'll say this for it--

308
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:32,583
it's the first thing he's
ever bought into that worked.

309
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,709
I, for one, never had a doubt.

310
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,125
My stock in this company

311
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,291
must have split at least
a dozen times by now.

312
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,875
Actually,
the process
of cryonics

313
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,500
was never more than a fad

314
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:46,458
and did not continue much
beyond the mid-21st century.

315
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,792
Uh-huh.

316
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:51,208
I need to make a phone call
as soon as possible.

317
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,375
A phone call?

318
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:54,458
Yes, I have provided
for myself.

319
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,792
I have
a substantial portfolio.

320
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:58,583
It's critical
that I check on it.

321
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,917
Let the bank know
that I'm alive and well.

322
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,208
Uh, that's going to be a little
difficult right at the moment.

323
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,792
Well, do you at least have a
copy of the<i> Wall Street Journal?</i>

324
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,083
I think we should take
the Doctor's advice.

325
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,625
Take this very slowly
until we've all adjusted.

326
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,208
And then we'll talk
to the Captain.

327
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,542
As you know, sir, there is
very little available

328
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,875
on the Romulans.

329
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,333
Counselor, anything
will be helpful.

330
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,875
They seem to be
creatures of extremes.

331
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:30,417
One moment, violent
beyond description

332
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,834
the next, tender.

333
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,500
They are related
to Vulcans

334
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,625
but, as each race
developed

335
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,417
their differences
grew wider.

336
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,583
They're intensely
curious.

337
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:45,000
Their belief in their own
superiority is beyond arrogance.

338
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,625
For some reason,
they have exhibited

339
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,417
a fascination
with humans

340
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,166
and it is that fascination,
more than anything else

341
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,959
that has kept the peace.

342
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,125
One other thing,
they will not initiate anything.

343
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,792
They will wait for you
to commit yourself.

344
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,333
Counterpunches.

345
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,750
Thank you, Counselor.

346
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,208
That's quite valuable.

347
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,083
Talk.

348
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,000
I'd like me a thick
Kansas City steak

349
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,000
and some country-fried potatoes

350
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,458
and a mess
of greens.

351
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,041
Oh, hell, just forget all that

352
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,917
and give me a martini
straight up with two olives...

353
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,583
for the vitamins.

354
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,834
Whoo.

355
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,834
Is something wrong?

356
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,000
Wrong?

357
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,375
Well, only
that your computer here

358
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:57,417
fixed about the best martini
I ever had.

359
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,834
I might just get
to like this place.

360
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,166
Let's see
if the Braves are on.

361
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,041
How do you
cut on this TV?

362
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,083
TV?

363
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,125
Yeah, the
boob tube.

364
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,750
I'd like to see how the Braves
are doing after all this time.

365
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:11,709
Probably still finding
ways to lose.

366
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,083
I believe he
means television, sir.

367
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,000
That particular form
of entertainment

368
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,959
did not last much
beyond the year 2040.

369
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,333
Well, what do you guys do?

370
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,333
I mean, you don't drink
and you ain't got no TV.

371
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,417
Must be kind of boring,
ain't it?

372
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,166
PICARD:
Number One.

373
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,041
Riker here.

374
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,250
Would you and Mr. Data
report to the Bridge?

375
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,417
At once, sir.

376
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,000
Uh, with whom

377
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,625
were you speaking?

378
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,166
The Captain.

379
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,083
Good, would you tell him
that I would like to see him

380
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,333
as soon as it's convenient.

381
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,875
What's going to
happen to us?

382
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:54,166
Do we stay
here with you?

383
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,792
Do we go back
to Earth?

384
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,417
That will all be
up to the Captain.

385
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,625
Well, get him in here.

386
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,500
I have to phone
Geneva right away

387
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,917
about my accounts.

388
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,041
(<i> chuckles</i> )

389
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,166
Why, the interest alone

390
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,250
could be enough
to buy this ship.

391
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,417
The Yankee's right.

392
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,667
Let's get the big boy in here.

393
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,166
I'll pass along your request.

394
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,583
If you'll excuse us.

395
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,625
Duty calls--
hey, I understand.

396
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,834
Why don't you come back later
on, and you and me will find us

397
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,792
a couple low-mileage
pit woffies

398
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,375
and help them
build a memory.

399
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,125
What is to be done
with them, sir?

400
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,625
I don't know.

401
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,208
Commander--
"a low-mileage pit woffie"?

402
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,458
This time
you've got me.

403
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,000
I haven't a clue.

404
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,291
They are the most
unusual humans

405
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,000
I have ever encountered.

406
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,375
Well, from what I've
seen of our guests

407
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,333
there's not much
to redeem them.

408
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,333
Makes one wonder how
our species survived
the 21st century.

409
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,291
Report.

410
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,417
We are six hours
from the Neutral Zone.

411
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,291
I've been unable
to establish communications

412
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,750
with any Federation colony

413
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:06,667
or station
in this vicinity.

414
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:08,583
How many outposts are
there in this sector?

415
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,875
Nine.

416
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:10,959
I think we should work
under the assumption

417
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,542
that they've
all been destroyed.

418
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,333
By the Romulans?

419
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,125
It fits
their historical pattern.

420
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,125
DATA:
Since we have had
no contact with the Romulans

421
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,583
for 53 years, seven
months, 18 days

422
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,750
we must consider
that the information

423
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:25,083
we do have is
out of date.

424
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,500
RIKER:
The positive side of
that is that the information

425
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:29,500
they have about us is
also out of date.

426
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,458
Captain, I think it's
that lack of information

427
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,750
that this is all about.

428
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,250
Go on.

429
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,834
In my opinion, the Romulans
want a confrontation

430
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,417
specifically with us.

431
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,709
The<i> Enterprise?</i>

432
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,000
Well, not by name,
but the Federation.

433
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,500
They know that the Federation
will send their best.

434
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:45,834
That will give them
a perfect chance

435
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,000
to see firsthand
how far we've advanced

436
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,750
both in technology
and technique.

437
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:52,208
What are you recommending?

438
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,375
I'm not sure I have
a specific recommendation.

439
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:56,500
Perhaps, we should
assume the initiative.

440
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:58,125
WORF:
I agree
with Commander Riker.

441
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,291
This may be
our only opportunity.

442
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,667
We should
seize it.

443
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,667
Mr. Data?

444
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:09,291
The strategy is built
on a single premise--

445
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,750
the hostile intent
of the Romulans.

446
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:16,750
If the premise is sound,
so is the proposal.

447
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,959
LA FORGE:
If their intention
isn't hostile

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,041
what is it?

449
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:23,667
OFFENHOUSE:
Captain Picard!

450
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:24,750
This is
Captain Picard.

451
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:25,959
To whom
am I speaking?

452
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,834
Ralph Offenhouse.

453
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,709
I need to talk to you.

454
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,166
What is going on here,
Number One?

455
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,125
Did you give him permission
to contact me?

456
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,375
Of course not, he must have
seen me use the com panel.

457
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,709
Ah, listen, Mr., um, Offenhouse

458
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,750
we're in a very important
conference right now.

459
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:42,959
I'm sick and tired

460
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,875
of being put off
by you and your staff.

461
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:48,000
This is the worst run ship
I have ever been on.

462
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,125
You should take some lessons
from the<i> Q.E. II.</i>

463
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,667
Now that's
an efficient operation.

464
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:53,750
Data, identify.

465
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,709
What is a "Q.E. II"?

466
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,083
It was a passenger liner

467
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,709
which mostly traveled
Earth's Atlantic Ocean

468
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,834
during the late 20th
and early 21st centuries.

469
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,834
He's comparing the<i> Enterprise</i>
to a cruise ship?

470
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:09,250
Captain Picard,
I demand that you see me!

471
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:12,959
I think I have been
very, very patient.

472
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,500
I demand a phone or a radio
or whatever else you have

473
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:19,208
but frankly,
enough is enough.

474
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,959
Especially
under the circumstances

475
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,959
and considering what I paid
for this procedure.

476
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I must make contact
with my law...

477
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,709
(<i> door opens</i> )

478
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,875
I'm Captain Picard.

479
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:34,375
Excellent.

480
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:35,583
Now maybe we'll be able

481
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,875
to get some things
straightened out.

482
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:38,291
We may indeed.

483
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,875
Those com panels are for
official ship business.

484
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:42,083
Well, if they're so important

485
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,917
why don't they
need an executive key?

486
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,041
Aboard a starship vessel,
that is not necessary.

487
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,291
We are all capable

488
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,041
of exercising
self-discipline.

489
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,542
Now, you will refrain
from using them.

490
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:54,625
Now, just a minute.

491
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,792
We are in
a very serious

492
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:59,250
and potentially
dangerous situation.

493
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,959
I'm sure whatever
it is seems very
important to you

494
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,375
but my situation
is far more critical.

495
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:09,709
I don't think you are aware
of your situation

496
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,417
or of how much time has passed.

497
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:15,917
Believe me, I am fully cognizant
of where I am and when.

498
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:18,375
It is simply
that I have more to protect

499
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:21,583
than a man in your position
could possibly imagine.

500
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,000
No offense meant,
but a military career

501
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:27,834
has never been considered
to be upwardly mobile.

502
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,834
I must contact my lawyer.

503
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,333
Your lawyer has been dead
for centuries.

504
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,125
Yes, of course I know that

505
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,583
but he was a full partner
in a very important firm.

506
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:42,500
Rest assured, that firm
is still operating.

507
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:50,750
That's what all this is about.

508
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:53,333
A lot has changed
in the past 300 years.

509
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:58,041
People are no longer obsessed
with the accumulation of things.

510
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:03,625
We've eliminated hunger, want,
the need for possessions.

511
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:06,083
We've grown out of our infancy.

512
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,792
You've got it all wrong.

513
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:10,417
It has never been
about possessions--

514
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,208
it's about power.

515
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,750
Power to do what?

516
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:18,834
To control your life,
your destiny.

517
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:22,000
That kind of control
is an illusion.

518
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,250
Really?

519
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,583
I'm here, aren't I?

520
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,250
I should be dead

521
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,834
but I'm not.

522
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,583
(<i> sobbing</i> )

523
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:38,542
What is it?

524
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:43,166
I don't know, it just started,
and it won't stop.

525
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,709
I keep thinking
about my boys.

526
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:52,417
Counselor Troi, will you
report to the guest lounge?

527
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:57,583
RIKER:
Captain, we are approaching
Science Station Delta Zero-Five.

528
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,625
Slow to half-impulse.

529
00:25:58,667 --> 00:25:59,875
I'm on my way.

530
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,959
CLEMONDS:
Captain,
I need to see

531
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,375
that pretty little doctor
of yours.

532
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:10,041
I'll inform her.

533
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:12,959
Captain, I didn't mean
to come on so strong.

534
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,542
It's just that I've
built my whole life

535
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:18,041
on knowing
what's going on

536
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,625
and for the first time,
I feel...

537
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,000
completely out of touch.

538
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,875
It's, uh, making me crazy.

539
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,417
You can understand that?

540
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,959
It's the first thing you've
said I do understand.

541
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,291
I'll see what I can do.

542
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:33,458
And please stay
off the com panels.

543
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,375
Counselor, will you get
those people under control.

544
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,917
We cannot afford this
continuing distraction.

545
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,542
Yes, sir.

546
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:53,417
(<i> door chimes</i> )

547
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:57,917
Hello.

548
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,667
My name's Deanna.

549
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:06,583
They sent you here
to settle me down?

550
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,333
I'm the Ship's
Counselor.

551
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,959
I thought you
might want to talk.

552
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,500
The local shrink?

553
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:19,792
I'm sorry,
I'm not familiar

554
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:21,583
with that term.

555
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,375
It doesn't matter.

556
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:29,500
You're feeling profoundly sad.

557
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:32,208
I can't stop crying.

558
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,667
I miss my sons.

559
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:37,959
And then I think, "I'm here,
but they're gone."

560
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:43,834
Donald--
that's my husband--

561
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,500
I love that man but,

562
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:49,834
good intentions aside,
he'd mess up a free lunch.

563
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:53,250
Why on Earth he ever
decided to do this.

564
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:56,125
He must have thought
you would have wanted it.

565
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:59,500
No, I can tell you
exactly what happened.

566
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:02,709
He couldn't think
about going on alone.

567
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,291
I died, and he
couldn't face it, so...

568
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,500
he figured he'd
have me frozen

569
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,959
and then, in his mind,
I wasn't really gone.

570
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:14,959
Sounds crazy but

571
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,250
you'd have
to know Donald.

572
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:22,375
I wish I knew what happened
to my children.

573
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:23,458
Did they get married?

574
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,875
Did they have kids?

575
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,750
Let's see if we can find out.

576
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:35,041
Computer, this
is Counselor Troi.

577
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:37,542
Request personal
history on...

578
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:40,000
What are their names?

579
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:43,667
Tommy-- he's eight
and Eddie's five.

580
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:47,834
COMPUTER:
Full names, date
and place of birth.

581
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,917
Um, they were born
in Secaucus.

582
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,709
That's in Jersey.

583
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,208
Can this
really work?

584
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,667
Can this tell me what's happened
to them?

585
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:56,792
Well, there must be a record
somewhere.

586
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:59,625
There's a good chance
we can find it.

587
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:02,917
Well, whether we do or not,
I want to thank you...

588
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,291
for trying.

589
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,333
Date of birth--

590
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:12,375
Tommy was born February 17.

591
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,750
Well, I just
got to have

592
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:15,291
a little something to jump-start
the morning

593
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,917
and a little something else
to shut down the night.

594
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,166
You have no medical need.

595
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,000
Well, it ain't a matter
of "need" darling.

596
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:23,500
It's a matter
of survival.

597
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,083
Sorry.
Not to worry.

598
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,834
Ol' Wade Toss'll scuffle
along the best way he can.

599
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:31,166
How do I get hold of that fella
with the strange-looking face?

600
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,500
I beg your pardon.

601
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:36,125
What's his name--
that, uh, android fella.

602
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,959
You mean
Lieutenant Commander Data?

603
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,375
That's the one.

604
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:41,083
I'll let him know
you're looking for him.

605
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,291
Much obliged.

606
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,792
You know, you just
about the prettiest

607
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,625
little ol' doctor
I ever seen.

608
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,500
Much obliged.

609
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,458
This is amazing.

610
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,625
It's all right here.

611
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:02,750
Ten generations
of your progeny.

612
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:05,458
Everyone I've
ever known is dead.

613
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,959
Do you mind?

614
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,959
I'd like to be alone.

615
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,792
No, not at all.

616
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,750
(<i> door chimes</i> )

617
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,709
You asked to see me?

618
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,959
Hey, look, I'm about
to go out of my mind
for something to do.

619
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I mean, sitting here
alone just don't get it.

620
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,625
Now, what say you
and I put together

621
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,000
a little party.

622
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,083
A celebration?

623
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,458
No, nothing that fancy.

624
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,667
Just some folks, some
suds and some sounds.

625
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:44,959
Why, hell, it ain't nothing
but something to do.

626
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,458
I will speak
to the Captain.

627
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,750
Great, you do that.

628
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:49,417
Inquiry.

629
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:51,542
You do not seem
to be having as much
difficulty adjusting

630
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,000
to your current
circumstances
as the others.

631
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,792
You mean being here
on this tub

632
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,041
400 years from
where I started?

633
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:01,375
Oh, heck, it's the same dance,
it's just a different tune.

634
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:04,458
You think anybody here's got
a guitar I could borrow?

635
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,208
No, but the computer can
replicate such an instrument.

636
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,500
I was kind of hoping
to get one

637
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:10,375
while I still
remembered the chords.

638
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:13,083
RIKER:
Commander Data, we are
approaching the Neutral Zone.

639
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,500
Report to the Bridge.

640
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:16,959
I must leave now.

641
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,333
What's this "neutral zone"?

642
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,583
It is a buffer
between the Romulan Empire

643
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,667
and the Federation.

644
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:26,000
Why does that make me nervous?

645
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,125
I do not know.

646
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,375
Well, we won't
be inviting

647
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:31,083
these Romulans
to our party, will we?

648
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:35,083
No, that would
not be... appropriate.

649
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,834
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

650
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,542
<i>We have arrived at the edge</i>
<i>of the Neutral Zone</i>

651
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,959
<i>where we will now have</i>
<i>an opportunity</i>

652
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,041
<i>to learn firsthand</i>
<i>what happened</i>

653
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:52,291
<i>to our distant outposts.</i>

654
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,542
Captain, there is nothing left

655
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:58,709
of Outpost
Delta Zero-Five.

656
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,500
Must have been one hell
of an explosion.

657
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:04,291
Sensors indicate no evidence
of conventional attack.

658
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:09,333
Can you determine
what happened?

659
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:11,542
The outpost was not
just destroyed.

660
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,208
It is as though
some great force

661
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,458
just scooped it off
the face of the planet.

662
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,959
Could it have been
a natural phenomenon?

663
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,333
Insufficient
information, sir.

664
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:26,083
Mr. La Forge.

665
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,500
Sir?

666
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:30,041
Set course for the next
closest station.

667
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,500
Aye, sir.

668
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:42,250
I have spent my entire career
being able to tell

669
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:45,125
when the other guy's mouth
is dry.

670
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:47,417
There is something
going on here.

671
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,542
Something serious.

672
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:50,625
The tension level

673
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,959
on this ship has jumped up.

674
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,041
CLEMONDS:
Well, even if
you're right

675
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,417
what can we do about it?

676
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,333
And besides, these ol' boys here
don't need us

677
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,750
tellin' 'em
where the bear sits.

678
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:00,750
Look here what that

679
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:02,166
young fella
made for me.

680
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,000
How did he do that?

681
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:09,417
He called it
a pattern replication.

682
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:11,333
It plays real good, too.

683
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:14,291
I am trying to tell you that
there is a situation developing

684
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:17,083
on this vessel
that directly affects us

685
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,500
and all you can talk about
is that stupid guitar.

686
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:23,208
Hey, now these folks don't need
us swimming in their soup.

687
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,542
So, why don't you just relax
and let them do their jobs?

688
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:28,542
Well, that may be
all right for you

689
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,000
but I am not willing
to allow<i> my</i> fate

690
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:32,917
to be decided
by others.

691
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,083
I, at least, want to know
what is going on.

692
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:43,917
We are approaching
Tarod Nine.

693
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:46,083
The condition
is identical, Captain.

694
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,083
Everyone and
everything is gone.

695
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,458
RIKER:
Captain--

696
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,291
I strongly recommend
that we go to red alert.

697
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,709
If the Romulans have improved
their cloaking device--

698
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,875
and we'd be fools
to believe they haven't--

699
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:58,959
we should assume
a more defensive posture.

700
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,375
I agree, Captain.

701
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:03,458
I recommend we go
immediately to battle stations.

702
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,125
I appreciate your
advice and concern

703
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:06,834
but this is not the time
for rash actions.

704
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:08,583
We are still investigating.

705
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,792
There are three other stations
in this sector we have to visit.

706
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:13,041
Let's proceed in a calm
and orderly manner.

707
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,208
If not battle stations,
may we at least take the ship

708
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,417
to yellow alert?

709
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,959
Yes, Number One,
that would be prudent.

710
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,291
Make it so.

711
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,917
(<i> beeping</i> )

712
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:26,500
COMPUTER:
All decks, yellow alert.

713
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,875
Um... let's see, uh...

714
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:55,083
I want to go to the, uh...

715
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:58,291
to the, um...

716
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:00,208
Where would the Captain be?
(<i> beeping</i> )

717
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,250
COMPUTER:
Captain Picard is located
on the Main Bridge.

718
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:07,417
Well then, take me
to the Main Bridge.

719
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:10,125
Captain, my sensors
indicate a disturbance.

720
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,750
It is large and moving, but I
cannot get a positive lock.

721
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:15,166
Nor can I get it
on the viewscreen.

722
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,208
Shields up.

723
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,208
WORF:
Aye, sir.

724
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,166
Captain, I recommend we transfer
all power to the phasers

725
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,875
and arm
the photon torpedoes.

726
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:25,583
Wait, if that is
a Romulan ship, they
will read our intent.

727
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:28,166
It will force them into taking
up a similar posture.

728
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:29,834
We don't want
to engage in battle.

729
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,959
Captain, this is
sufficient evidence.

730
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,417
Outposts have been destroyed.

731
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,458
Countless lives
have been lost.

732
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,041
WORF:
I have
a positive lock.

733
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,834
They're disengaging
their cloaking device.

734
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,500
They'll only be vulnerable
for an instant

735
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,625
as they become visible.

736
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:47,333
Captain, this may be
our only chance.

737
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,709
No.

738
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,375
Where are they?

739
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,792
WORF:
The signal
is weakening.

740
00:35:56,834 --> 00:36:00,125
I've lost them.

741
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,750
Damn.

742
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,667
Mr. Data, your sensors
picking up anything?

743
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,959
You should be
detecting a disturbance.

744
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,709
Negative, sir.

745
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,250
We wanted to know if they had
improved the cloaking device.

746
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:16,083
Guess we have our answer.

747
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:18,875
They were trying to determine
our intent.

748
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:21,125
They wanted to see
if we would fire.

749
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,625
Who the hell are "they?"

750
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:26,000
Get that man off
the Bridge<i> now.</i>

751
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,375
I'm not going anywhere.

752
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:29,709
WORF:
Captain!

753
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,166
They're back.

754
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,583
Amazing.

755
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,583
I never thought I'd see
a Romulan vessel.

756
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:03,709
Not this close.

757
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,083
The last time we
encountered them

758
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,834
was decades ago.

759
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:09,291
It cost thousands of lives.

760
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:12,041
I can believe that.

761
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,875
Stay calm, everyone.

762
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:16,834
Open hailing frequencies.

763
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:20,458
Captain, these are Romulans.

764
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,250
They are without honor.

765
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:25,542
They killed my parents
in an attack on Khitomer

766
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:28,417
when they were supposed
to be our allies.

767
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:32,875
They believe humans and Klingons
are a waste of skin.

768
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,208
Lieutenant, control
your emotions.

769
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,917
Please open
hailing frequencies.

770
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:44,333
Hailing frequencies open.

771
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,709
Romulan vessel, this is
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

772
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,500
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

773
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,083
Sensors indicate all
of their systems are armed, sir.

774
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,834
But they have not fired.

775
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:03,583
I am Commander Tebok.

776
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:07,375
Commander, you have crossed
the Neutral Zone.

777
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:10,250
This is Federation territory.

778
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,208
It was necessary.

779
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,500
It might be viewed
as an act of aggression.

780
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,667
If our intent
were aggression

781
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:18,542
you would not
be here now.

782
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,792
If we go to war

783
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:24,542
let us be sure it is
for the right reason.

784
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:26,750
We are here
because our outposts

785
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:29,750
which border
on the Neutral Zone

786
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:31,667
were also attacked.

787
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,375
Destroyed in the exact
same manner as your own.

788
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:36,917
Even so, what gives them
the right

789
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,917
to enter
Federation space?

790
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:41,375
Silence your dog,
Captain.

791
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:45,375
Lieutenant Worf's question
is valid.

792
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:46,917
To even ask
such a question

793
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:49,875
implies that we
need permission.

794
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,542
We do not.

795
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:54,458
Do you think
that we attacked
your outposts?

796
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,542
Once we realized
the level of destruction

797
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:01,041
we knew it could not
have been you.

798
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:05,750
Who is responsible?

799
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:11,875
They haven't got a clue.

800
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:13,834
They're hoping
you know

801
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:16,125
but they're
too arrogant to ask.

802
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,000
You're out of line, mister.

803
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:21,542
Yes, but it's
a correct assessment.

804
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:22,792
We do not know

805
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:25,208
who is responsible.

806
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,542
Why entire outposts
on both sides

807
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:31,041
have been carried off.

808
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:33,500
I would like
to offer a proposal.

809
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:35,375
An alliance?

810
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:38,375
Between the Romulans
and the Federation?

811
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,583
Nothing so grandiose.

812
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:45,041
Just this... cooperation.

813
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,166
There was an intent here.

814
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:49,250
Whoever or whatever did this

815
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,834
is more powerful
than either of us.

816
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,500
Let's collaborate.

817
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:58,500
Let's share whatever
we learn about what
has happened here.

818
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:01,542
Agreed, on
this one issue

819
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,750
and only if it
is convenient

820
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:08,208
and appropriate
at the time.

821
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,417
Captain Picard

822
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:11,667
because
your actions

823
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,500
are those of
a thoughtful man

824
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:15,792
I'll tell you this.

825
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:20,417
Matters more urgent
caused our absence.

826
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:24,750
Now, witness
the result.

827
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:27,125
Outposts
destroyed

828
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:32,041
expansion of
the Federation
everywhere.

829
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:38,125
Yes, we have indeed
been negligent, Captain

830
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,083
but no more.

831
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,709
Commander, we have made
some progress here.

832
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,834
Let's not ruin it
with unnecessary posturing.

833
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:49,750
Your presence
is not wanted.

834
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:53,875
Do you understand
my meaning, Captain?

835
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:57,333
We are back.

836
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,542
I think our lives just became
a lot more complicated.

837
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:17,417
Get him off my Bridge.

838
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:32,750
I found something.

839
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:36,750
I've been able
to locate a family

840
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:39,792
living just outside
of Indianapolis.

841
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:42,417
The man's name
is Thomas Raymond.

842
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,834
That's my son's name.

843
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:45,959
My son's name is Tommy.

844
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,583
Computer, let us see
Thomas Raymond.

845
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,834
RAYMOND:
Oh, my God.

846
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:54,959
That's Donald.

847
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,375
That's my husband.

848
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:57,875
Actually, it's

849
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:01,625
your great, great, great,
great, great grandson.

850
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,375
He's the spitting image.

851
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:07,083
Well, I have
his address.

852
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,166
When you get back to Earth

853
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,750
you can go
and see him.

854
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:13,208
No, I'll be out of time.

855
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,208
A relic.

856
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,083
Perhaps.

857
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:19,709
But it's a place to start.

858
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:24,291
After all,
he is family.

859
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,875
There's no denying that.

860
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,208
Here's what I propose.

861
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,583
You can't stay
on the<i> Enterprise</i>

862
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:33,000
but I have arranged
for us to rendezvous

863
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:35,625
with the USS<i> Charleston</i>
bound for Earth.

864
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,000
They will
deliver you there.

865
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:39,125
Then what will
happen to us?

866
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,041
There's no trace
of my money.

867
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:43,208
My office is gone.

868
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,792
What will I do?

869
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:47,542
How will I live?

870
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:49,917
This is the 24th century.

871
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:52,000
Material needs no longer exist.

872
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,750
Then what's the challenge?

873
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,166
The challenge, Mr. Offenhouse,
is to improve yourself

874
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:06,166
to enrich
yourself.

875
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,166
Enjoy it.

876
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:11,000
Well, one good thing is

877
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:12,041
since everybody
has forgotten

878
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:13,875
everything
I ever did

879
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:16,083
it will all be
brand spanking new.

880
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:20,333
I'll be a bigger hit
than I ever was.

881
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:21,375
Perhaps so.

882
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:23,750
Anything is possible.

883
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:25,166
What say, son?

884
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:28,583
You'd make a hell
of a sideman.

885
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:31,333
That offer does present
a certain fascination.

886
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:41,625
Captain, I've
plotted a course

887
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:42,834
to intercept
the<i> Charleston</i>

888
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:43,834
but they've
just informed me

889
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,000
that they'll be making

890
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:46,917
an extended stop
at Arloff Nine.

891
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:48,750
Your point,
Mr. La Forge?

892
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,291
Well, at warp eight,
we could have our guests

893
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:53,667
at Starbase 39 Sierra
in five days.

894
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:56,000
Take months off their journey.

895
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:57,875
But they'll benefit
from the extended time

896
00:43:57,917 --> 00:43:59,041
it will allow
them to acclimate

897
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,583
before returning to Earth.

898
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:02,750
RIKER:
It's a pity we can't
take them there ourselves.

899
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:06,875
Having them on board
is like a visit from the past.

900
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:09,291
That would take us
in the wrong direction.

901
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:11,834
Our mission is
to go forward

902
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,917
and it's just begun.

903
00:44:13,959 --> 00:44:18,208
Set velocity warp six,
Mr. La Forge.

904
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,625
Aye, sir.
Warp six.

905
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:23,917
There is still much to do.

906
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:25,917
Still so much to learn.

907
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:31,834
Mr. La Forge, engage.
