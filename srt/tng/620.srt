00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,500
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46731.5.</i>

2
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:07,917
<i>We're in the midst of</i>
<i>the Volterra Nebula--</i>

3
00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:09,417
<i>a stellar nursery.</i>

4
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,500
<i>Our three-week mission</i>
<i>is a routine analysis</i>

5
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:13,250
<i>of several dozen protostars</i>

6
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,583
<i>in various stages</i>
<i>of development.</i>

7
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:19,166
Captain, I have completed
the spectral evaluation

8
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,458
of the outer shell.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,875
Our survey of this protostar
is complete.

10
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:25,041
Ensign, lay in a course for
the next one, 3/4 impulse.

11
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,750
Riker to Captain Picard.

12
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,250
Go ahead, Number One.

13
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,709
RIKER: May I see you in the
observation lounge, sir?

14
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll be right there.

15
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:50,542
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:54,834
MAN: Then you<i> can</i> identify
that object, Mr. Picard?

17
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:57,125
Professor Galen?

18
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,041
Computer, lights up.

19
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:02,500
I suppose I should say,
"Captain" Picard.

20
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:03,834
The professor contacted me

21
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,000
from his shuttle
about an hour ago.

22
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,458
He suggested that
we surprise you.

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,291
To clarify, I insisted,
and your first officer

24
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,250
was good enough
to accommodate me.

25
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,458
I trust I'm not being
overly presumptuous,

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,083
now that my star pupil
is master of the stars?

27
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,542
No one could be more
welcome on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

28
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:34,500
I never thought I would
see a Kurlan<i> naiskos.</i>

29
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,625
Fifth Dynasty?

30
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:42,250
Is that your conclusion,
Mr. Picard?

31
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,875
Forgive me again.
I should say Captain.

32
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:48,291
Oh, please.
Mister will do fine.

33
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,625
Um... well...

34
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:55,667
the overall impression is
certainly Fifth Dynasty.

35
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,959
Um... the...

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,792
the surface ornamentation...

37
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:04,041
Yes?

38
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,917
Green polychrome over the eyes

39
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,333
and the eyes themselves
are closed.

40
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,583
(<i> snaps fingers</i> )

41
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,875
This is Third Dynasty.

42
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:20,125
From the workshop of
the Master of Tarquin Hill.

43
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,375
Well done.

44
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,166
Will...

45
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:28,959
the Master of Tarquin Hill
designed ceramic objects

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,667
that were 300 years
ahead of their time.

47
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,875
All we know of him
is the work.

48
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:37,583
His name was never discovered.

49
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:42,166
This object is over
12,000 years old.

50
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,834
The planet Kurl?

51
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,417
That's a hell of a long way
outside Federation territory.

52
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,250
Indeed-- I thought your
study of Kurlan artifacts

53
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,291
was done long ago.

54
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,208
Well, I happened to be in
the neighborhood last summer.

55
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,208
I couldn't resist.

56
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,792
Go ahead.

57
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,959
You mean, it's complete?

58
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,542
Oh...

59
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,333
(<i> sighs</i> )

60
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,458
Will.

61
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,458
The Kurlan
civilization believed

62
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,000
that an individual was a
community of individuals.

63
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,417
Inside us are...

64
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:36,375
many voices,
each with its...

65
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,000
its own desires,
its own style,

66
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,625
its-- its own
view of the world.

67
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,709
The Kurlan
civilization died out

68
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,250
thousands of years ago.

69
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,166
It is extraordinarily rare
to find a figurine intact.

70
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,542
Professor, this is
an incredible find.

71
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,291
It's yours, Jean-Luc.

72
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,417
Oh, no.

73
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,542
No.

74
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,917
How can I accept this?

75
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,458
Graciously,
Mr. Picard.

76
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,041
You could accept it
graciously.

77
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,041
Thank you.

78
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,041
(<i> sighs</i> )
How long can you stay?

79
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,709
There's so much
to talk about.

80
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,500
The professor is scheduled
to meet a Vulcan transport

81
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:18,959
the day after tomorrow.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Two days? But that's
not enough time.

83
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,375
We may have considerably
more than that.

84
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:24,834
I don't understand.

85
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,291
I am currently
on an expedition--

86
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,166
a journey into an unexplored
and historical territory--

87
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,792
and I intend
to take you with me.

88
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:10,250
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

89
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:14,375
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

90
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:16,208
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

91
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,875
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

92
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:24,458
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

93
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,917
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

94
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,709
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>
<i>It's been over 30 years</i>

95
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,291
<i>since I last saw</i>
<i>my archaeology professor.</i>

96
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,542
<i>His presence has taken me</i>
<i>back to a time</i>

97
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,709
<i>when I had considered</i>
<i>a very different career.</i>

98
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,625
May I ask you a
frank question?

99
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,792
Please.

100
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,333
Your published writings

101
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:45,000
have been sporadic
for the past decade.

102
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,834
Your appearance at
symposia has been rare

103
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,500
or scheduled and
then canceled

104
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,417
at the last moment.

105
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:55,709
The finest archaeologist
of this century is now...

106
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,625
shrouded with a
cloak of mystery.

107
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,583
And as a result,
my reputation

108
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,166
has no doubt grown.

109
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,500
(<i> chuckles</i> )
I've never heard of anyone

110
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,166
who didn't love
a good mystery.

111
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,000
The Satarran of Sothis III
disdain them,

112
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:14,000
but as a general idea,
your statement holds.

113
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:18,875
So, what<i> have</i> you been
doing for the past decade?

114
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,959
Are you familiar with
micropaleontology?

115
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,500
Yes, it's the study
of fossil records

116
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,125
at the microscopic level.

117
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,542
I read your papers
on the subject, but...

118
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,792
that was years ago.

119
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,000
It seemed as though
the work had stopped.

120
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,625
No.

121
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,667
The work continued.

122
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,250
I made a discovery
so profound in its implications,

123
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,709
that silence seemed
the wisest course.

124
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,333
This work has occupied
my every waking thought.

125
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,166
It's intruded
upon my dreams.

126
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,667
It's become my life.

127
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:03,667
When finished...
and I announce my findings,

128
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,667
it'll be heard halfway
across the galaxy.

129
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,250
Tell me.

130
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,166
I cannot, Mr. Picard.

131
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,208
That information
comes with a price--

132
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,834
your agreement to join me
on the final leg

133
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,375
of this expedition.

134
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,792
For how long?

135
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:26,333
Three months.
Perhaps a year.

136
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:30,500
If I had complete diplomatic
access and a starship,

137
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:31,917
it'd be a matter of weeks.

138
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:35,375
But, as it is,
we'll only have my shuttle

139
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:38,583
and whatever arrangement we
can make with transports...

140
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,917
combined with our talents.

141
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:43,750
Why do you need
my help in this?

142
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,667
I am not a young man.

143
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,000
There will be hazards
along the way.

144
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,875
I don't want my
own inadequacies

145
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:58,000
to jeopardize
the completion of this work.

146
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,291
I'm deeply honored

147
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,834
that you should
think of me, but...

148
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

149
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,000
I have responsibilities.
To history.

150
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,417
What if you could
have helped Schliemann

151
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,041
discover the city of Troy,
or been with M'tell

152
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,792
when she first
stepped on Ya'seem?

153
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,583
How can anything compare?

154
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,250
May I sleep on it?

155
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,625
Dream not of today,
Mr. Picard.

156
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:26,250
"Dream not of today?"

157
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,375
The night blessing
of the Yash-El.

158
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:31,333
As I recall,
you missed that question

159
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,375
on your final exam.

160
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, I've had a few years
to look it up.

161
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,917
Professor,
the<i> Enterprise</i> is yours

162
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,250
for as long as you're here.

163
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,792
Thank you.

164
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Dream not of today.

165
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,625
(<i> door chimes</i> )

166
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,583
Come.

167
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,709
Good morning.

168
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,542
Looks like you've
been up for a while.

169
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,834
Yes.

170
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,500
Let's hear it.

171
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,250
(<i> sighs</i> )

172
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,500
I had a long talk with
Professor Galen last night,

173
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,291
and he asked me to leave
the<i> Enterprise</i>

174
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,375
and to join him in
an archaeological expedition

175
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:24,083
which could last for
nearly a year.

176
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,917
That must be tempting.

177
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,667
I couldn't leave
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

178
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,500
But the offer raised in me

179
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:34,291
certain feelings of...
regret.

180
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,959
That you could have been
an archaeologist

181
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,709
and not a starship captain?

182
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,875
No, not really.

183
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,500
I'm not sorry for
the path that I chose,

184
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:49,208
but the professor
did not choose

185
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,875
this gift at random.

186
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,667
The many voices
inside the one.

187
00:10:56,792 --> 00:11:00,208
You see, he knows that the past

188
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,041
is a very insistent voice
inside me,

189
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,667
and this gift is meant
to remind me of that.

190
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,583
And the exploration of space--

191
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,166
surely that must
count for something.

192
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,792
I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

193
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,375
And I would still
make the same choice

194
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,417
that I made all those years ago.

195
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:21,291
I just wish that I didn't have
to say no to him a second time.

196
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,208
Were you two very close?

197
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,875
I had a father...

198
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:31,291
but he was like a father
who understood me.

199
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,792
And he had his own children,

200
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,458
but they didn't
follow in his footsteps.

201
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,834
So, I was like the son
who understood<i> him.</i>

202
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,125
And yet, you turned
your back on him.

203
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,125
In a way, I wish that he'd
never come on board the ship.

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Good morning, Mr. Picard.

205
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,291
Professor.

206
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,583
The Vulcan ship will
take us as far as DS4.

207
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,000
An Al-Leyan transport is
scheduled to arrive

208
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,125
at the station
three weeks later.

209
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,250
And they'll take us to Caere,
and then we'll use the shuttle

210
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,917
to get us to Indri VIII,
our first stop.

211
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,792
Professor...

212
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:23,792
I am afraid I won't be going.

213
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,583
The<i> Enterprise</i>
isn't something

214
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,667
that I can leave and
then come back to.

215
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,208
If I go,
I go for good.

216
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,125
And it's not something that
I'm prepared to do.

217
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,000
This is not some
undergraduate

218
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,417
study project that
you're turning down.

219
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,583
This is the chance
of a lifetime.

220
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,667
Don't make the
same mistake twice.

221
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:48,834
You don't believe that
my career in Starfleet

222
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,125
has been a mistake.

223
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,875
What are you doing
at this very moment?

224
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:55,792
A study mission!

225
00:12:55,834 --> 00:13:00,208
You're like some Roman centurion
out patrolling the provinces

226
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,041
maintaining a dull
and bloated empire.

227
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,875
We both know that's not true.

228
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,625
I know this.

229
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:10,083
I know that as a scholar,

230
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,500
you're nothing
but a dilettante.

231
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,500
Years ago, I gave you
the opportunity to become

232
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:19,750
the foremost archaeologist
of your generation.

233
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,959
Your achievements could
have outstripped even my own

234
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,917
but, no,
you decided to reject

235
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,417
a life of profound
discovery,

236
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,792
and you walked
out on me.

237
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:33,750
I never wanted to become...

238
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:41,208
Will you come with me?

239
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:46,208
I can't.

240
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,166
Then I'll be going.

241
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,041
But, Professor,
you're not scheduled

242
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,000
to catch the Vulcan ship
for another two days.

243
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,709
There's nothing for me here.
Good-bye,<i> Captain.</i>

244
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,750
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

245
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,291
<i>We have completed our mission</i>
<i>in the nebula and are en route</i>

246
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,208
<i>to a diplomatic conference</i>
<i>on Atalia VII.</i>

247
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,750
<i>I must admit,</i>
<i>I have lost my enthusiasm</i>

248
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,083
<i>for those proceedings.</i>

249
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,000
At our present speed,
we will arrive

250
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,250
at the Atalia system
in 37 hours.

251
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,959
Captain?

252
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,041
I'm going for a walk
in the arboretum.

253
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,166
I wouldn't mind
some company.

254
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,083
WORF:
Captain?

255
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,291
A distress call from
Professor Galen's shuttle.

256
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,583
On screen.

257
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,959
<i>Enterprise,</i> I'm being boarded!

258
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,709
Transmission
has been blocked.

259
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,333
I have located
the shuttle, sir.

260
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,166
It is under attack.

261
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,875
Take us out of warp.
On screen.

262
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,000
WORF:
A Yridian destroyer.

263
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,583
Battle stations!
Aye, sir.

264
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,583
Professor Galen is still
inside his vessel, sir.

265
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,333
His life signs are
barely registering.

266
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,250
Get him out of there.

267
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,375
The shuttle is enveloped
by a tractor beam.

268
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:58,333
The transporter
cannot penetrate it.

269
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,458
Hail the Yridians.

270
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,625
They are not responding.

271
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,709
(<i> alarms blaring</i> )

272
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,542
Return phaser fire.
Disable their offensive systems.

273
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,625
Worf!

274
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,542
I don't understand, Commander.
The phaser blast

275
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,000
was not powerful enough
to destroy the ship.

276
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,834
Transporter Room One,
lock onto Professor Galen

277
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,583
and transport him
directly to Sick Bay.

278
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,166
CREWMAN:
Aye, sir.

279
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,875
He took a disrupter hit
point-blank.

280
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:34,375
There is nothing I can do.

281
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,458
(<i> monitor beeping</i> )

282
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,458
Jean-Luc...

283
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,625
I was too harsh.

284
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,000
(<i> steady tone</i> )

285
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,917
I'd say at least
three Yridians

286
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,375
boarded the
professor's shuttle.

287
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:07,625
What did they want?

288
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,333
We're not sure,
but it looks like

289
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,750
they were trying to download
something from his computer.

290
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:13,417
When he was attacked,
Professor Galen began

291
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,709
to protect certain files
in his computer memory.

292
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,208
We were able to
partially reconstruct

293
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,625
the shuttle's computer,
so at least we have

294
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,875
some of those files.

295
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:25,792
We found 19 different blocks
of numbers like this one.

296
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:26,917
What do they mean?

297
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,542
They could mean anything.

298
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,542
Unless we narrow
the parameters of the search,

299
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,166
it would be almost impossible
for the computer

300
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,542
to identify the pattern
with any accuracy.

301
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,208
We tried every
decryption key on record

302
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,709
in case Professor Galen
was using some kind of code,

303
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,959
but we still can't make
heads or tails of them.

304
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Were the Yridians able to
get the number blocks?

305
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,208
At least some of them.

306
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,625
It's impossible
to know how many.

307
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,208
Apparently, the Yridians knew

308
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,333
more about the professor's work
than we do.

309
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,917
They may have known
what these numbers mean.

310
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,542
Well, if they did,
that information died with them.

311
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,417
Not necessarily.

312
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,000
The Yridians
are information dealers.

313
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,291
They may have been delivering

314
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,375
these number blocks
to someone else.

315
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:05,333
Did they send a signal
before they were destroyed?

316
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,792
No, sir.
We detected no transmissions.

317
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:09,750
And there were no other ships
in the vicinity.

318
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,834
Did the shuttle's
flight log show

319
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,959
where Galen had been
before coming to the<i> Enterprise?</i>

320
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,834
Yes, sir, the logs indicate
Professor Galen visited

321
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,625
an unexplored
star system-- Ruah IV.

322
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,458
What's the distance
from our present position?

323
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,083
Four days at warp six, sir.

324
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,667
The conference can wait.

325
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:41,125
Set a course
for the Ruah system.

326
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,875
Standard orbit, Ensign.

327
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:55,250
Ruah IV is a class-M planet.

328
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,083
67% of its surface
is covered with water.

329
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,375
Its land mass contains
multiple animal species,

330
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:03,834
including a genus
of proto-hominids.

331
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,709
Scan for earthworks
and monuments

332
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,417
that might indicate
a previous civilization.

333
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,667
There is nothing to indicate
former occupancy

334
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:14,083
by even
a primitive culture, sir.

335
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,792
Then what was the
foremost archaeologist

336
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:17,959
in the Federation
doing here?

337
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:24,333
He left the<i> Enterprise</i> in a
Vulcan ship for Deep Space 4,

338
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:28,500
and then an Al-Leyan transport
to Caere, and then the shuttle

339
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:29,917
to Indri VIII.

340
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,917
Mr. Data, what do we know
about Indri VIII?

341
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,750
The Indri system
was first identified

342
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:36,458
by Federation vessels
nearly 60 years ago.

343
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,834
The eighth planet is L-class.

344
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,166
It is covered with
deciduous vegetation,

345
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,041
unexplored, with no apparent
evidence of civilizations,

346
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,875
either past or present.

347
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,792
The planet possesses
no animal life whatsoever.

348
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:54,542
Number One, we will proceed
to Indri VIII.

349
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,834
With all due respect, sir,

350
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,500
we've already run
into one dead end.

351
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,125
Indri VIII doesn't seem
much more promising.

352
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,291
And we're late for the
conference on Atalia VII.

353
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,834
I'm aware of the Federation's
timetable, Number One.

354
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,458
Professor Galen visited
here a few days ago,

355
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,417
and he was on his way to
Indri VIII when he was killed.

356
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,583
There is some connection
between these two planets.

357
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,667
I'm going to find it.

358
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:14,875
Aye, sir.

359
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:18,166
Ensign, lay in a course for
Indri VIII, warp seven.

360
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,250
(<i> door chimes</i> )

361
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,083
Come.

362
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,709
How's it going?

363
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,542
I thought that if I stared

364
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,583
at these number blocks
long enough,

365
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:41,000
then I would begin to
see some kind of pattern.

366
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,959
So far...

367
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,917
Nothing.

368
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:48,500
I meant,
how's it going with<i> you?</i>

369
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:01,166
If I had gone with him--

370
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,709
Captain, you can't start
thinking like that.

371
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,250
You didn't abandon him.

372
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,375
You chose not to abandon
a lifelong career.

373
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,709
It was the right decision,
and in no way

374
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,458
responsible
for his death.

375
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,792
I realize that.

376
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:19,208
I know how much
the professor meant to you,

377
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,166
and how much you want to
find out what happened.

378
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,917
But staring at these numbers

379
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,417
isn't going to
bring him back.

380
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,166
The conference
on Atalia VII

381
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,625
has been scheduled
for six months.

382
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,166
Starfleet is relying on
your mediation efforts to--

383
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,542
Counselor, this is
not simply a case

384
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,625
of me taking the<i> Enterprise</i>
and its crew

385
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,041
on some wild goose chase

386
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,417
to purge myself of
guilt and remorse.

387
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,208
I will not let Galen's death
be in vain.

388
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,208
Now, if that means
inconveniencing

389
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,125
a few squabbling delegates
for a few days, then so be it.

390
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,625
I will take
the full responsibility.

391
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,166
Captain.

392
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,458
(<i> sighs</i> )

393
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,792
We're about to enter
the Indri system, sir.

394
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:11,917
Riker to Picard.

395
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,333
We are approaching
Indri VIII.

396
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,709
PICARD:
On my way.

397
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,166
Sensors are picking up

398
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,083
severe atmospheric fluctuations
on the planet.

399
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,291
RIKER:
Assume a high orbit.

400
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,500
On screen, Mr. Worf.

401
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,083
WORF:
Some sort of plasma reaction

402
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,917
is consuming the
lower atmosphere.

403
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:30,458
Can we stop it?

404
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,625
No, sir.
The reaction is global.

405
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:35,792
All life on the planet
is being destroyed, sir.

406
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,333
Why would anyone
want to destroy all the life

407
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,959
on an uninhabited,
neutral planet

408
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,750
with no strategic
importance whatsoever?

409
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:56,709
"All the life..." 

410
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,875
Perhaps the professor's
number blocks

411
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,458
had something to do
with organic matter.

412
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,000
If we narrow the
search parameters

413
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,500
to the biological database,
it might increase

414
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:08,125
the chances of the
computer finding a match.

415
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,375
I'll be in the lab.

416
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,500
COMPUTER:
Pattern match found.

417
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,458
Specify.

418
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,125
COMPUTER: The number blocks are
mathematical representations

419
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:23,709
of fragments of
deoxyribonucleic acid strands.

420
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,250
DNA fragments?

421
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:29,375
Each a different life-form
from 19 different worlds.

422
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:30,917
The planets that these
fragments are from

423
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,333
are scattered
across the quadrant.

424
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,792
No wonder it took the
professor so long

425
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:35,417
to collect them, but why?

426
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,208
Wait a minute.

427
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,000
These fragments all seem to have
similar protein configurations.

428
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,959
They may be
chemically compatible.

429
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,458
But how can that be possible?

430
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,083
They're different species
from different planets.

431
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,875
There should be
no compatibility at all.

432
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:53,291
I know, but look at the
base pair combinations--

433
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,583
they're uniform.

434
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,083
If I'm right...

435
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,667
Computer,
connect the DNA fragments

436
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:01,750
according to protein link
compatibility.

437
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,709
What is it?

438
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:09,458
I have no idea.

439
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,709
This is not part of a
natural design, Captain.

440
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,542
This is part of
an algorithm

441
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:15,875
coded at the
molecular level.

442
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:17,333
An algorithm?

443
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,375
Are you saying that these
DNA fragments are elements

444
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:20,917
in some kind of
computer program?

445
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,667
I know how it sounds,
but there's no way

446
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,417
this could be
a random formation.

447
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,583
This is definitely
part of a program.

448
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,375
This fragment has been part
of every DNA strand on Earth

449
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:30,959
since life began there,

450
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,667
and the other fragments
are just as old.

451
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,875
Someone must have written
this program

452
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:37,583
over four billion years ago.

453
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:41,750
So... four billion years ago
someone scattered

454
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:44,417
this genetic material
into the primordial soup

455
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,458
of at least 19 different planets
across the galaxy?

456
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,750
DATA: The genetic information
must have been incorporated

457
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,792
into the earliest life-forms
on these planets

458
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:53,875
and then passed down
through each generation.

459
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,959
But why would anyone do this
in the first place?

460
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,417
And what was this
program designed to do?

461
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,792
Well, we couldn't know
that until we assembled

462
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:01,583
the entire program
and ran it.

463
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,333
We've tried all
of the DNA material

464
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,041
in the Federation computer,
but we haven't been able

465
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,458
to come up with any compatible
protein configurations.

466
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,375
Then, they must be from
worlds outside the Federation.

467
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,375
Mr. Data, how many people
on the<i> Enterprise</i>

468
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,792
are from
non-Federation planets?

469
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:15,166
17, sir.

470
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,792
You know, this may
be a long shot,

471
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,166
but we should check
each one of these 17 people

472
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,417
to see if they have the correct
protein configuration.

473
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:23,750
I'll begin collecting
DNA samples now.

474
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,250
You know, Captain,
I've been thinking.

475
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:28,083
Somebody else must know
about this program.

476
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,667
I bet one of the missing
fragments was on Indri VIII,

477
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:32,959
and that's why
it was destroyed.

478
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,583
To keep us from finding
that piece of the puzzle.

479
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,500
Mm-hmm.

480
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,417
It's four billion
years old--

481
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:43,083
a computer program from a
highly-advanced civilization.

482
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:47,542
And it's hidden in the very
fabric of life itself.

483
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:50,750
Whatever information
this program contains

484
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:55,375
could be the most profound
discovery of our time...

485
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:57,583
or the most dangerous.

486
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:02,083
And the professor knew that.

487
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,333
(<i> sighs</i> )
They all came up negative.

488
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,125
Well, I have been
through every page

489
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,041
in the professor's
published works

490
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,834
looking for some clue
as to where to go next.

491
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,709
So far, nothing.

492
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,333
Maybe we've been
at this too long.

493
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:25,041
Why don't we get
some sleep

494
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:27,083
and start again
tomorrow morning?

495
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,125
I was in the neighborhood.

496
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,750
Hmm?

497
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,959
When I asked the professor
why he went all the way to Kurl,

498
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,750
he said,
"I was in the neighborhood."

499
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,041
Doing what?

500
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:47,041
Collecting DNA samples.

501
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,834
There's only one planet
in the Kurlan system

502
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:55,959
capable of supporting life--
Loren III.

503
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:59,500
No.
There is no Loren III sample

504
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:02,458
from the data downloaded
from the professor's shuttle.

505
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,625
If he did have one,
it must have been taken

506
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,333
by the Yridians
when they attacked.

507
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:10,208
Mr. Data, set a course for
Loren III, maximum warp.

508
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,125
DATA:
Aye, sir.

509
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,875
We are approaching
the Loren system.

510
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:21,166
RIKER:
Slow to half impulse.

511
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,792
Take us into orbit
above the third planet.

512
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:24,667
There is a good chance
that our competition

513
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,500
may be here before us.

514
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:27,959
Battle stations,
Mr. Worf.

515
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,166
Aye.

516
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,834
We are now entering orbit.

517
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,458
PICARD:
On screen.

518
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,792
RIKER:
You were right, Captain.

519
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:35,959
We've got company--
Cardassians.

520
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,125
They are hailing us.

521
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,375
On screen.

522
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:41,583
My name is Gul Ocett.

523
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:42,959
Identify yourself,

524
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,709
and state your business
in this star system.

525
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,583
I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard

526
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:49,792
of the Federation
Starship<i> Enterprise,</i>

527
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:53,250
and I see no reason
why I should answer to you.

528
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,750
Cardassians have no claims
in this sector.

529
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,375
I suppose not.

530
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:59,875
But my admittedly
hasty estimate

531
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:04,792
shows one Federation starship
and<i> two</i> Cardassian war vessels.

532
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,166
Perhaps I have miscounted.

533
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,917
Not at all.

534
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:11,917
But we are on a purely
scientific mission.

535
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,875
You have no reason
to interfere with us.

536
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:15,625
And you have nothing to lose

537
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,375
by delaying a purely scientific
mission for a few days.

538
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:21,083
I invite you to withdraw.

539
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,417
Captain, Klingon
attack cruiser decloaking

540
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:26,875
off the starboard bow.
They are hailing us.

541
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:30,125
KLINGON: This is the
Klingon vessel<i> Maht-H'a.</i>

542
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,709
What are you
doing here?

543
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,208
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

544
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,667
<i>It seems that we have not one</i>
<i>but two competitors</i>

545
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:43,792
<i>in our attempt to complete</i>
<i>Professor Galen's puzzle.</i>

546
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:46,583
<i>I have prevailed upon the</i>
<i>Cardassian and Klingon Captains</i>

547
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,166
<i>to meet with me.</i>

548
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,333
I believe we all know
why we're here.

549
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:53,291
If we can admit that,
then we can move forward.

550
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,667
We were merely
scouting the planet

551
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:57,041
for possible colonization.

552
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,917
Pah! A ridiculous story.

553
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,458
What were you
doing here, then?

554
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,834
Scientific research.

555
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,208
Ha!

556
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,041
Look, if we try to
deceive one another,

557
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:08,667
then we shall
get nowhere.

558
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:10,417
I think we all know

559
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:13,583
about Professor Galen's
research...

560
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,250
and about the computer program

561
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:18,000
composed of
DNA fragments.

562
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:26,000
I will take your silence
as a confirmation.

563
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,792
Now, it stands to reason

564
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:29,875
that none of us have
the DNA fragments

565
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,208
necessary
to complete the program.

566
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,667
You were the first to arrive
in this system.

567
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:38,417
Do you have an organic sample
from the planet below?

568
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:43,250
Yes, and I will fire on anyone

569
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,000
who attempts to obtain
another one.

570
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:48,542
As if we fear
Cardassian threats.

571
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:52,667
I believe that one of you has
a fragment from Indri VIII.

572
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:54,125
KLINGON:
Yes.

573
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,709
And there will be
no other samples

574
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,291
from Indri VIII.

575
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,792
What is that supposed to mean?

576
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:01,625
He destroyed
the biosphere of the planet

577
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:02,959
after he had taken the sample.

578
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,917
(<i> hissing</i> )

579
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:07,041
Typical Klingon thinking--

580
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:10,166
take what you want
and destroy the rest.

581
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:12,125
PICARD: We're all missing
some of the fragments--

582
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:14,792
not necessarily the same ones.

583
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:17,125
But unless we combine
the ones we have,

584
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,166
we will never learn
the secret of the program.

585
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,959
There is no secret.

586
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,750
It is an ancient weapon design
of incredible power.

587
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:27,000
And the Klingon Empire
will not allow it

588
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:29,250
to fall into
an enemy's hands--

589
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,166
or even a friend's.

590
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,917
A weapon?

591
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:34,959
The Yridian who sold us
the information

592
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,542
claimed that
the program would yield

593
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,834
the key to an unlimited
power source.

594
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:42,625
But until we assemble it,
we will never know its purpose.

595
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:44,750
He's right.

596
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:47,834
As far as we know, it might
just be a recipe for biscuits.

597
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,458
Biscuits?

598
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,750
If that is what you believe,
then go back to Cardassia.

599
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:55,125
I will send you
my mother's recipe.

600
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,000
How dare you!
PICARD:<i> Mev yap!</i>

601
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,375
Enough!

602
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:01,417
Without cooperation,
we will get nowhere.

603
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,417
What do you propose?

604
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:09,917
If you each bring your samples
on board the<i> Enterprise,</i>

605
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:12,667
I will combine them with ours.

606
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:16,792
And then we will all observe
the results simultaneously,

607
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,375
giving no one the advantage.

608
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,417
And if we refuse?

609
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:26,834
Then this endeavor dies here
in this room.

610
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,125
Captain.

611
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,834
KLINGON:
Excellent.

612
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,458
CRUSHER:
There's still one missing piece.

613
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,917
<i>Pahk!</i> We have
surrendered

614
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,625
what we had
for nothing.

615
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:03,291
You are remarkably
shortsighted, Nu'Daq.

616
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,834
We are closer to the
answer than we were.

617
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,125
We may be very much
closer, indeed.

618
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,667
NU'DAQ:
How can that be?

619
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:10,041
We have no idea where
to start looking

620
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:11,667
for the missing
DNA fragment.

621
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:13,041
This is a jigsaw puzzle

622
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,917
whose pieces are scattered
across the galaxy.

623
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,458
Doesn't it make it
natural to assume

624
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,583
that the original designers
of the puzzle

625
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,458
should want us to find it?

626
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,041
Why else would they have put
the pieces in our DNA?

627
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,959
And, in turn,
wouldn't that suggest

628
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,083
that they would try to
make it easy for us

629
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,583
to find those pieces?

630
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:31,291
That there might be some
pattern to the distribution?

631
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,458
The computer might be able
to find that pattern.

632
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,000
Doctor, program the
computer to analyze

633
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:38,208
the distribution of the
pieces that we have,

634
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,375
correcting for changes
in star configurations

635
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:41,834
over four billion years.

636
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,375
Then extrapolate for
the missing piece.

637
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:45,041
That's going to take
several hours to set up

638
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,166
and to process.
Excuse me.

639
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:49,625
If you wish, you can stay
on board while we wait.

640
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:51,041
I intend to.

641
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,291
(<i> conversations and laughter</i> )

642
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:08,917
Good evening,
Commander Data.

643
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,250
Captain.

644
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:12,583
Is there any word yet
on the missing fragment?

645
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:14,834
The computer is
processing the data.

646
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,166
I will be notified as soon
as there is any information.

647
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:21,250
Ah... Commander,
your reputation

648
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:23,875
for physical strength
is known

649
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:26,208
even in the
Klingon Empire.

650
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,083
You are familiar with
the<i> B'aht Qul</i> challenge?

651
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,333
I am familiar with
many Klingon rituals,

652
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:33,000
including the<i> B'aht Qul.</i>

653
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,625
Ahh...

654
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,041
<i>Haa.</i>

655
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:48,166

<i>Maw' tok!</i>

658
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:56,834
(<i> grunting</i> )

659
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:06,625
My upper spinal support
is a polyalloy

660
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:08,792
designed to withstand
extreme stress.

661
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:12,417
My skull is composed
of cortenide and duranium.

662
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,500
(<i> grunting</i> )

663
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:30,166
I understand your
intellectual prowess

664
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,250
is equally impressive.

665
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:40,000
If I were to learn
of the results

666
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:42,750
from the computer search
before the others,

667
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:47,667
the Klingon Empire would
have a strategic advantage.

668
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:50,542
A being of your abilities

669
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:54,208
would go far
in the Empire.

670
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,834
You are attempting
to bribe me.

671
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:58,500
Not at all.

672
00:33:58,542 --> 00:33:59,959
You suggested a plan
that would work

673
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,375
to your advantage--

674
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:03,667
one that I would be
capable of executing.

675
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,083
You then implied
a reward.

676
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,208
Clearly, you were--

677
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,083
Commander... never mind.

678
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,709
(<i> beeping</i> )

679
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,834
What the hell?

00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,625
Computer,

00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:35,750
La Forge to Captain Picard.

683
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:36,875
PICARD:
What is it, Geordi?

684
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,333
You might wanna
come down here.

685
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,792
I found something
that I think you should see.

686
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:46,333
The computer has completed
its analysis.

687
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,834
The computer was able
to extrapolate

688
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,000
this geometric pattern
based on the distribution

689
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:54,417
of the fragments.

690
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:57,333
Computer, highlight the section
of the missing pattern.

691
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:02,542
The missing DNA fragment
should be in this system.

692
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:05,125
The star is in Sector 21459--

693
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,041
the Rahm-Izad system.

Let's make it look good.

The power boost to the

703

protected the nacelles.
We used the inertial dampers

704
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,792
to simulate complete
shield failure.

705
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:56,250
It is fortunate
that your engineer

706
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,000
discovered
Gul Ocett's attempt

707
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:01,125
to tamper with your
defensive systems.

708
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,500
<i>Maht-H'a,</i> status.

709
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:05,875
KLINGON: Minor damage
to starboard nacelle.

710
00:36:05,917 --> 00:36:08,709
We will be operational
in less than one hour.

711
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,667
What?!
You incompetent<i> toh-pah!</i>

712
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:13,625
You were supposed
to be prepared.

713
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:17,250
The Cardassian vessels have
set a course for Rahm-Izad.

714
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,959
Well, it won't take them
long to realize

715
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,375
that Rahm-Izad
is the wrong planet.

716
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:25,000
Captain, you're very
welcome to join us.

717
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:28,166
I... will go with you.

718
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:32,000
Ensign, set in a course for
the Vilmoran system, warp nine.

719
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,625
ENSIGN: Aye, sir.
Engage.

720
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:40,542
I am scanning all seven planets
of the Vilmoran system.

721
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:42,083
None appears
to support life.

722
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,792
How can that be?
The professor's data depends--

723
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,875
Correction-- the second
planet shows evidence

724
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,875
of an ancient ocean, now dry.

725
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:49,458
It once supported life?

726
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,458
Yes, and it still may,
in a limited fashion,

727
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,750
not detectable
by our long-range sensors.

728
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,709
Lay in a course, Ensign.
Full impulse.

729
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,709
Riker to Transporter Room One.

730
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,166
Captain, we've located a planet
that may still support life.

731
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:02,417
We'll know in a minute.

732
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,041
Any sign of the Cardassians?

733
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,333
RIKER: Not yet,
but we don't know how long

734
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:06,542
it'll stay that way.

735
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:08,291
Acknowledged.

736
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,500
I am reading a small pocket
of vegetative life--

737
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:17,542
a primitive lichen growing
in a fossilized seabed.

738
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:20,125
Transporter Room One, I am
programming the coordinates.

739
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,333
Stand by.

740
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:37,417
There. Over there.

741
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,291
RIKER:
Captain, we've got company.

742
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,959
I'm ready to pull you
out of there.

743
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,417
PICARD: Wait for
my order, Number One.

744
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,000
(<i> whoosh of active transport</i> )

745
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,542
You dishonorable<i> toh-pah.</i>

746
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:05,500
Perhaps we could exchange
insults some other time.

747
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:07,291
I'm rather
busy now.

748
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:10,583
Well... it was
quite a chase,

749
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,250
wasn't it,
my friends?

750
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,166
How--
ROMULAN: We intercepted

751
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,834
several communiques between
the Yridians and Cardassia.

752
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,458
My ship was watching under cloak

753
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,959
when Professor Galen's
shuttle was attacked.

754
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,125
And you have been
shadowing us ever since.

755
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,625
And now,
the reward.

756
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,166
Step clear, please.

757
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,333
I shall destroy the
entire rock face

758
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:34,792
and every trace
of DNA with it.

759
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:37,542
You will go back to
Romulus empty-handed.

760
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:40,000
Your superiors will
be quite pleased.

761
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:43,709
Perhaps we could come
to a compromise?

762
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,500
You give us the gene code
and the Romulans...

763
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:46,917
(<i> whispering</i> )
The seabed--

764
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:49,208
it may be only
partially fossilized.

765
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,250
It could still contain
organic material.

766
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,583
OCETT: ...particularly
strong bargaining...

767
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,333
Which would still
contain the DNA.

768
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,583
NU'DAQ: I have been
searching for the answer

769
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,709
as long as anyone.

770
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,291
I will not be
eliminated now.

771
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,458
ROMULAN: You can be
eliminated by a disrupter.

772
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,041
Now, what do you
say to my offer?

773
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:05,000
How can I be sure you won't
kill me if I acquiesce?

774
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:06,625
I've given you my word.

775
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:08,500
Etched in stone,
no doubt.

776
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:11,250
No deals!
There will be no deals

777
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,583
as long as I am
still alive.

778
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,083
ROMULAN: Do not
press me, Klingon.

779
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:16,583
I don't care whether
you live or die.

780
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,792
WORF: If you fire,
others will, also.

781
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:20,250
Many will die.

782
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,834
ROMULAN:
We have superior numbers.

783
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:23,875
PICARD: The program
has been activated.

784
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:26,291
I think it's reconfiguring
the tricorder.

785
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,166
We will die
together, brother.

786
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:30,000
<i>Tash-koh-tah.</i>

787
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,959
It's modifying
the diode emitter

788
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,166
to project something.

789
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,917
You are wondering
who we are,

790
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:46,250
why we have done this,

791
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:49,208
how it is come that
I stand before you--

792
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,667
the image of a being
from so long ago.

793
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:57,083
Life evolved
at my planet

794
00:39:57,125 --> 00:40:01,166
before all others
in this part of the galaxy.

795
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:05,500
We left our world,
explored the stars,

796
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:08,417
and found none
like ourselves.

797
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:12,458
Our civilization
thrived for ages.

798
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,041
But what is the life
of one race

799
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:19,083
compared to the vast
stretches of cosmic time?

800
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,375
We knew that one day,
we would be gone

801
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:25,000
that nothing
of us would survive.

802
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,875
So, we left you.

803
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:30,583
Our scientists seeded
the primordial oceans

804
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:34,417
of many worlds where life
was in its infancy.

805
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,083
The seed codes directed

806
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,750
your evolution toward
a physical form

807
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:41,041
resembling ours--

808
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:44,667
this body you see
before you...

809
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:48,333
which is, of course,
shaped as yours is shaped--

810
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:51,417
for you are the end result.

811
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:54,333
The seed codes also
contained this message,

812
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:59,041
which was scattered in fragments
on many different worlds.

813
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:02,417
It was our hope that you
would have to come together

814
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:06,875
in fellowship and companionship
to hear this message.

815
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:11,083
And if you can see and hear me

816
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:14,041
our hope has been
fulfilled.

817
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:17,542
You are a monument...

818
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:20,458
not to our greatness,

819
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,625
but to our
existence.

820
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:27,417
That was our wish--
that you, too,

821
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:30,083
would know life,

822
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:34,750
and would keep alive
our memory.

823
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:39,125
There is something
of us in each of you,

824
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:44,375
and so, something of you
in each other.

825
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:47,000
Remember us.

826
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,667
That's all?!

827
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:55,583
If she were not dead,
I would kill her.

828
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:57,959
The very notion that
a Cardassian could have

829
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,709
anything in common
with a Klingon--

830
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,792
it turns my stomach.

831
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:03,959
Picard to<i> Enterprise.</i>

832
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:05,667
RIKER:
Standing by, sir.

833
00:42:05,709 --> 00:42:09,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46735.2.</i>

834
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:12,667
<i>Our frequent use of high warp</i>
<i>over the last few days</i>

835
00:42:12,709 --> 00:42:15,417
<i>has overextended</i>

836
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:16,959
<i>We are finishing minor repairs</i>

837
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,583
<i>before returning</i>
<i>to Federation territory.</i>

838
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,625
It's a shame
Professor Galen

839
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:23,542
didn't live to see the
end result of his study.

840
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,291
I can't think of anyone who
would have appreciated it more.

841
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:28,250
If it hadn't
been for you

842
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,959
his dream to
solve that puzzle

843
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,291
would never have
been realized.

844
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:35,166
You left him a
wonderful legacy.

845
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:37,458
Yes, but it would have been
a more fitting legacy

846
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,208
if the message had not
fallen on such deaf ears.

847
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,542
Hmm. You never know.

848
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:44,792
Hmm.

849
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:46,959
Well...
(<i> sighs</i> )

850
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,041
I<i> have</i> to get
this day started.

851
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:50,750
Both of us.

852
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:52,542
See you this afternoon.

853
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,500
Riker to Captain Picard.

854
00:42:56,542 --> 00:42:59,375
Incoming transmission
from the Romulan command ship.

855
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:00,792
PICARD:
Put it through.

856
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:02,625
Acknowledged.

857
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:07,333
Captain, my ships are leaving
orbit for Romulan space.

858
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,333
Until our next encounter.

859
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:14,375
Until then.

860
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:19,375
It would seem that we are not
completely dissimilar after all

861
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:22,917
in our hopes,
or in our fears.

862
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:27,583
Yes.

863
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:31,041
Well, then, perhaps...

864
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:33,500
one day...

865
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:37,625
One day.
