1
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:12,625
Data,
there you are.

2
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,583
We need to install that
plasma conduit right away.

3
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,291
We're bringing the
new warp core on line

4
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,625
in less than
three hours.

5
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:19,542
I will go to deck 20
and begin modifications.

6
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:20,875
Great. I'll meet you
in Engineering

7
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:23,083
as soon as you're
finished there.

8
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:29,959
This ought to be a lot of fun!

9
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,709
(<i> phone ringing in distance</i> )

10
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,750
(<i> ringing gets louder</i> )

11
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:46,917
(<i> men grunting</i> )

12
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,500
Excuse me.

13
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:53,083
(<i> ringing continues</i> )

14
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,500
Do you have authorization
to work in this area?

15
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,333
You are dismantling
a warp plasma conduit.

16
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:04,083
I must ask you
to stop.

17
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,458
(<i> high-pitched shrieking</i> )

18
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,250
Be quiet!

19
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,500
(<i> shrieking stops</i> )

20
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:15,417
(<i> electrical fritzing</i>
<i>and crackling</i> )

21
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,542

26

<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

27
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:11,583
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

28
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,417
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

<i>to explore</i>

31

<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47225.7.</i>

33
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,417
<i>Commander La Forge has</i>
<i>completed the installation</i>

34
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,041
<i>of our new warp core.</i>

35
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,625
<i>We are preparing</i>
<i>to test its capabilities.</i>

36
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,875
Something wrong,
sir?

37
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:44,250
I just got a message
from Starfleet Command.

38
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,834
Bad news?

39
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,458
You could say that.

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,125
I've been invited

41
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:53,166
to the annual Starfleet
admirals' banquet.

42
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,375
My condolences.

43
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,709
I've managed to avoid it
for the past six years

44
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,458
but now it would seem
that my luck has run out.

45
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,083
Can't think
of anything
more tedious.

46
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:11,875
50 admirals shaking hands,
making dull conversation.

47
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:14,917
Uninteresting food,
boring speeches...

48
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,458
Can't you think
of some excuse

49
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,125
to get out of it?

50
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,875
After six years,
Number One,

51
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:22,750
I don't think I have
any excuses left.

52
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,542
Geordi, have you
ever had a nightmare?

53
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,792
Yeah,
sure, Data.

54
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:33,041
Everybody does
from time to time.

55
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,875
I have had 111 dreams

56
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:37,792
since I first discovered
this program

57
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:39,333
nine months ago.

58
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,792
In all of that time,
I have never experienced

59
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:43,208
such strange and
disturbing imagery.

60
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,083
I believe it
was a nightmare.

61
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,583
Well, nightmares are a part
of dreaming, Data.

62
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,333
Maybe you've
just discovered

63
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,083
another level
to your program.

64
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,333
Perhaps.

65
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,792
(<i> beeping</i> )

66
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,667
I have also noted
that I am spending

67
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,458
an inordinate
amount of time

68
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,792
thinking about
nightmare imagery.

69
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:12,250
One could almost say
I am preoccupied.

70
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,500
Well, it's perfectly
normal, Data.

71
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:15,750
Sometimes when
I have a nightmare

72
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:17,208
I can't shake that
weird feeling

73
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,709
for a couple
of days.

74
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,333
WOMAN:
Commander La Forge?

75
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,750
Speaking
of nightmares.

76
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,625
I just finished
recalibrating

77
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,417
the starboard
EPS module.

78
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,166
That's great,
Ensign, thank you.

79
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,709
It's just
like you said--

80
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,000
"Reset the power tap"--

81
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,417
and the module
came right on line.

82
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,834
You have such a wonderful grasp
of engineering principles.

83
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,208
I'm learning so much

84
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,583
just being
around you.

85
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,792
(<i> clearing throat</i> )
I'll tell you what--

86
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,125
Why don't you
help Farrell

87
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,542
check out the
deuterium cartridges.

88
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,917
We're just about to bring

89
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,500
the warp core on line,
all right?

90
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:48,834
Anything you say.

91
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,834
Geordi, you do not seem
to appreciate

92
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,083
Ensign Tyler's
enthusiasm.

93
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,750
She's enthusiastic,
all right--

94
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,208
about me.

95
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,709
I do not understand.

96
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,208
She's got a crush
on me, Data.

97
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,834
You do not share
her affection?

98
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,208
Exactly,
and quite frankly,

99
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,500
it's beginning to get
a little bit...

100
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,458
uncomfortable.

101
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,208
I believe
I understand.

102
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,291
You are concerned about
unintentionally hurting

103
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,000
Ensign Tyler's
feelings.

104
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,875
Yeah.
Something like that.

105
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,041
It would appear

106
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,750
that you require
a third party

107
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,709
to intervene
on your behalf.

108
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,041
I will be happy
to speak to her.

109
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,208
No, Data.

110
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,625
I'll take care
of it myself.

111
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:40,959
Thanks.

112
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,834
Geordi, when I first
awoke from my nightmare

113
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,375
there was a brief
moment when I...

114
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,458
PICARD:
Bridge to Commander La Forge.

115
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,250
What's our status?

116
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,458
We're ready to bring
the new core on line, Captain.

117
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,792
Stand by.

118
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,208
(<i> beeping</i> )

119
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,959
All right.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,458
Let's do it.

121
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,709
Initializing...

122
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,875
deuterium infusion sequence.

123
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:22,208
It's a thing of beauty,

124
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,542
isn't it?

125
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:28,750
Now let's see how
fast she can run.

126
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,417
La Forge to Bridge.

127
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,709
Warp power

128
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,542
at your discretion, captain.

129
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,083
Acknowledged.

130
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,041
Ensign Gates, set course
for Starbase 219.

131
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,458
Warp six.

132
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,083
Engage.

133
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,500
Engage.

134
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,166
Bridge
to Engineering.

135
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,583
Mr. La Forge, why
isn't my ship moving?

136
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,208
I'm on it, Captain.

137
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,959
There's a warp plasma
conduit out of alignment...

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,125
but I think I've
got it fixed now.

139
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,875
Ready, sir.

140
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,083
Very well.

141
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,500
Ensign Gates.

142
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,041
(<i> engines powering down</i> )

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,500
Mr. La Forge.

144
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:19,917
Stand by, Captain.

145
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,375
Captain, I am taking

146
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,291
the warp coil engines
off-line.

147
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

148
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,667
La Forge to Bridge.

149
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,375
I'm sorry, sir,

150
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:32,250
but we're going to
have to reconfigure

151
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,792
this plasma conduit.

152
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:37,041
It's going to take at least
a couple of hours, sir.

153
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

154
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,583
(<i> door chimes</i> )

155
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,875
Enter.

156
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,458
Hello, Data.

157
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,959
Counselor.

158
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,834
What are you doing?

159
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,250
I have been
watching Spot sleep.

160
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,750
In the past
15 minutes

161
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,959
he has had
12 muscle spasms

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,041
which indicates
he was dreaming.

163
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,417
I have often wondered
what Spot dreams about.

164
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,667
His twitching
and rapid breathing

165
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,917
would seem
to suggest anxiety

166
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,250
but Spot has
never seen a mouse

167
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,500
or any other form
of rodentia.

168
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,750
He has never
encountered an insect

169
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:34,625
or been chased
by a canine.

170
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:38,583
I understand you've had some
interesting dreams recently.

171
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,500
Geordi was worried
about you

172
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:42,834
and he wanted me to check in
and see how you were doing.

173
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,083
That was very
thoughtful of him.

174
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,166
I have been debating
whether or not

175
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,583
to initiate
another dream sequence.

176
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,834
Because of
the nightmares?

177
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,083
I have found them

178
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,125
to be quite...

179
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,917
unsettling.

180
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:01,333
Data, you shouldn't be afraid
of dark imagery in your dreams.

181
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,667
It's a natural expression

182
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,125
of your
unconscious--

183
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,875
if you have
an unconscious.

184
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm not sure how your
positronic brain works

185
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,333
but if it's
anything like ours,

186
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,250
then there's a part of you
that's trying to express itself

187
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,166
through
your dream state.

188
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,458
And I think you
should allow yourself

189
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,750
to experience it.

190
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,625
As Sigmund Freud said--

191
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:26,041
"Dreams are the royal road
to the knowledge of the mind."

192
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,625
Hmm.

193
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,417
Thank you, Counselor.

194
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,709
I believe I will initiate
a dream program now.

195
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,750
Let me know
how it goes.

196
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,250
Good night, Data.

197
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,041
Good night,
Counselor.

198
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,417
Good night, Spot.

199
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,834
(<i> meows</i> )

200
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,542
(<i> stilted yawn</i> )

201
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,417
(<i> smacks lips</i> )

202
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,166
Computer, dim lights.

203
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:54,250
Mmm...

204
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,250
Delicious.

205
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,375
What kind of cake
are you eating?

206
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:07,750
It is a cellular peptide cake
with mint frosting.

207
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,250
Would you
like a bite?

208
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,500
No, thank you.

209
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:14,333
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

210
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,166
Excuse me, Mr. Worf.

211
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,417
Aren't you going
to answer that, Mr. Data?

212
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,125
Sir?

213
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,417
That damn ringing.

214
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,000
Answer it,
will you?

215
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,208
Yes, sir.

216
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,667
(<i> men murmuring</i> )

217
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:45,917
Please identify
yourselves.

218
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,375
I must ask what you
are trying to...

219
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:51,291
(<i> high-pitched shrieking</i> )

220
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,625
Be quiet!

221
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:54,041
(<i> shrieking stops</i> )

222
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,917
(<i> ringing continues</i> )

223
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,500
Please...
Don't hurt me, Data.

224
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,834
I am sorry, Counselor.

225
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,083
No...

226
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,333
Don't.

227
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,709
No! No!

228
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,875
Data!

229
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:19,500
TROI:
Data.

230
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:21,083
Data!

231
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,667
What is wrong?

232
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:34,875
We've been trying to wake you
for the last five minutes.

233
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,709
When you didn't show up on time
in Engineering, I got worried.

234
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,500
My internal chronometer
was supposed to wake me

235
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:42,959
35 minutes ago.

236
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:46,792
You must have
overslept.

237
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,792
That is not possible.

238
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,333
Something
is wrong.

239
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,500
I can't find
anything wrong

240
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,458
with your internal
time-base.

241
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,250
As far as I can tell,
your primary systems
check out fine.

242
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,125
I will compare
my autonomic logs

243
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,750
with the ship's
chronometer.

244
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:11,125
Perhaps we have
overlooked something.

245
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,750
You know...

246
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,959
Data,
there's an awful lot

247
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,125
we don't know
about your dream program.

248
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,500
Maybe it was designed
to cause side effects.

249
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,792
I mean, for all we know,
Dr. Soong might have intended

250
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,542
for you to oversleep
from time to time.

251
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,583
It's part of
the human experience.

252
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,041
It is a possibility.

253
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,458
However, I would prefer
to make certain

254
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,375
there are no anomalies
in my neural nets.

255
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,041
You know, I'm curious.

256
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,917
What were you dreaming about
when we woke you up?

257
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,917
I have not fully assimilated
its impact.

258
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,709
I would prefer to study
the images further

259
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,333
before discussing them.

260
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,625
Hmm... sounds like it must
have been pretty strange.

261
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:59,667
"Strange" is not
a sufficient adjective

262
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:01,834
to describe
the experience.

263
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:09,834
(<i> in Austrian accent</i> ):
Tell me more about this... cake.

264
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,417
It is difficult
to explain.

265
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,458
Counselor Troi's body
was a cake.

266
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,709
Her<i> upper</i> body.

267
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:23,166
Describe the knife you used
to cut the counselor.

268
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,375
It had a black handle
and a serrated blade

269
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:27,959
and it was quite long.

270
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,458
How long?

271
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
25 centimeters
in length.

272
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:32,709
Hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm.

273
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,625
And what
happened next?

274
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:38,750
One of the workmen pointed
to her right shoulder.

275
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:42,125
At that moment,
I had an overwhelming urge

276
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,667
to cut a piece
out of the cake.

277
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,417
And did you?

278
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,000
Yes.

279
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,583
As I began
slicing the cake,

280
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,834
she reacted as though
I was causing her pain.

281
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:57,542
Yet I could not
stop cutting.

282
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,792
That is when I woke up.

283
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,041
Hmm.

284
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,667
Dr. Freud,
I am curious...

285
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,500
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

286
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,750
I am curious.

287
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:12,500
What do my nightmares
mean?

288
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,583
I believe you are experiencing

289
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:26,000
a classic dismemberment
dream.

290
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:29,917
Or, in your case,
being a mechanical man

291
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:32,583
a dismantlement dream.

292
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,542
I do not understand.

293
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:39,750
Your mechanistic qualities are
trying to reassert themselves

294
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:42,083
over your human tendencies.

295
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:48,166
Ego and id struggling
for domination.

296
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:52,583
The workmen symbolize
the ever-present id

297
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:56,333
constantly working
to destroy the ego.

298
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,959
Now, the image
of Counselor Troi--

299
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,125
a female--
is devoured by you,

300
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:07,625
clearly indicating
an unconscious desire

301
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:11,083
to possess
your own mother.

302
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,792
But I do not
have a mother.

303
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:15,291
Do not interrupt.

304
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,583
The knife--

305
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,208
in its violent connotation--

306
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:25,333
suggests a certain feeling
of sexual inadequacy.

307
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,750
But I have
no sexual desire.

308
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:31,083
Ach! Impotence on top
of everything!

309
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,583
It is all becoming clear
to me now.

310
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,583
There might be
a paper in this.

311
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,583
I do not believe I am
being helped by this session.

312
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,792
Classic transference!

313
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:50,125
Your anger toward me
is, in fact,

314
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,333
the animosity you feel
toward your father.

315
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:58,375
You are a polymorphously
perverse individual, Mr. Data

316
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:01,959
and I recommend
full psychoanalysis.

317
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,959
I believe I can
fit you in, uh...

318
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,792
next Tuesday.

319
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,667
That will not be necessary.

320
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:12,000
Computer,
end program.

321
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,083
(<i> communications beep</i> )

322
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:31,375
Captain, incoming message
from Admiral Nakamura.

323
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:32,834
On screen.

324
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:36,000
Admiral.

325
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,959
Captain.

326
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
We were expecting you
this morning.

327
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,625
Is there a problem?

328
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,792
Actually, we have
been experiencing

329
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,667
a few minor difficulties
with our new warp core,

330
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,291
but my chief engineer assures
me that we will be underway

331
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,875
within the hour.

332
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:56,250
You're not trying to avoid
this particular engagement,

333
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,458
are you, Picard?

334
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,208
No, no, certainly not.

335
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,917
I'm... really looking forward
to it.

336
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:04,000
Good.

337
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,041
I'll expect you soon.

338
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,458
Nakamura out.

339
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,625
I think he's
on to you, sir.

340
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:11,875
Hmm.

341
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,333
La Forge to Bridge.

342
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,667
Go ahead, Geordi.

343
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:16,875
We've just started
it up, Captain.

344
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:18,250
All systems
are holding steady.

345
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,375
Ready when you are, sir.

346
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,083
Ensign Gates.

347
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,625
Set a course...

348
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,667
and engage.

349
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,458
PICARD:
Engineering, report.

350
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,959
The warp field
has collapsed, sir.

351
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,709
It looks like
we've blown

352
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,250
the entire power
converter, Captain.

353
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,583
Impulse engines
are down, too.

354
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,542
We're not
going anywhere.

355
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,000
But I know just
how to fix this.

356
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,208
Give me two,
three hours, tops.

357
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,500
Talk about
going nowhere fast.

358
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:54,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

359
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:59,041
Mr. Worf, open a channel
to Starbase 219.

360
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,709
Advise
Admiral Nakamura

361
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,709
I'll be a little later
than I thought.

362
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,458
Aye, sir.

363
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,083
Tyler, how are
you coming

364
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,792
with that
relay diagnostic?

365
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,291
Almost done, sir.

366
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,917
Excuse me.

367
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:25,542
I need the plasma
inverter.

368
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,166
It appears Ensign Tyler
still has a crush on you.

369
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,750
It is clear you did
not speak to her.

370
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,917
No, Data, I haven't
had the time.

371
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,083
Listen, I want you
to take this brace coil

372
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,333
and run a metallurgical
scan on it for me.

373
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,041
See if there are
any microfractures.

374
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,834
Something wrong,
Data?

375
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,166
I am reminded
of a recent dream.

376
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,583
(<i> chuckling</i> )

377
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,041
This brace is
reminiscent of...

378
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,458
(<i> phone ringing in distance</i> )

379
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,500
(<i> ringing continues</i> )

380
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:24,375
RIKER:
Are you going to answer that,
Commander?

381
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,000
What are you waiting for?

382
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,333
Answer it!

383
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,792
Hello?

384
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,417
FREUD:
Kill them.

385
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,750
You must kill them all...
before it's too late.

386
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:49,125
Data...

387
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:52,375
Data,
what's wrong?

388
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:01,125
I do not know.

389
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:07,583
Everything seems to remind me
of the nightmare.

390
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:11,208
Objects, sounds, smells.

391
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,500
And now I have seen elements
of the dream in a waking state.

392
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,917
I cannot explain it.

393
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,750
Data, if you were one
of my human patients,

394
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:21,458
I might be concerned
right now.

395
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,333
I'd say you've had
a waking dream--

396
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,458
or an hallucination.

397
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,041
But you're
not human.

398
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,834
I think we might be
looking at some kind

399
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,959
of technological
problem.

400
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,709
I have run three
complete self-diagnostics.

401
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,500
All of my systems are
functioning normally.

402
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,667
Perhaps Dr. Freud
was correct.

403
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:41,875
The knife I dreamed about
is the embodiment

404
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:43,417
of my unconscious desire

405
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,667
to inflict
violence.

406
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:47,458
Data, even Freud said

407
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,834
"Sometimes a cigar
is just a cigar."

408
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,500
but the bottom
line is

409
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:56,250
I think you're developing
an almost obsessive interest

410
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,250
in your own
inner workings.

411
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,417
I'd almost call it

412
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,333
the beginnings
of a neurosis.

413
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,208
That is not possible.
Why not?

414
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,583
You've eliminated all the
technical explanations

415
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:10,333
and it makes sense
that as your neural net

416
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,417
becomes more complex,
more human,

417
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,250
that you might
experience

418
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:17,834
the same kind of psychological
complexities as a human.

419
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,792
Do really think
that is possible?

420
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,083
Data, you must be
the first person

421
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,834
who's come into my office

422
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,959
and been excited at
the prospect of a new neurosis.

423
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,083
But yes, I do think
it's possible

424
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,333
and I'd like to start
counseling you

425
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,709
on a regular basis.

426
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,083
Daily?

427
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,792
No, we'll start weekly,
and as a first step,

428
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:41,041
I'd like you to shut down
your dream program

429
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,291
until our next session,
just to be on the safe side.

430
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,041
Give yourself
a chance

431
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,291
to reflect on
this experience.

432
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,166
Thank you, Counselor.

433
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,375
I look forward
to our next meeting.

434
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:53,750
And Data...

435
00:23:56,542 --> 00:24:00,750
Next time... see me
before you see Sigmund.

436
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,709
Admiral, I can explain...

437
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,625
NAKAMURA:
Let me guess.

438
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:14,917
Your new warp core is
malfunctioning again.

439
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:17,959
Unfortunately, the problem has
affected our impulse systems.

440
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,208
At the moment,
we... are adrift.

441
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,625
Are you expecting to have
this problem fixed soon?

442
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:26,667
Or shall we send out
a tow ship to bring you in?

443
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,125
That will not
be necessary.

444
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,166
I have every confidence
in my Engineering staff.

445
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,333
I will be
at the banquet on time.

446
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:33,959
Picard out.

447
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,166
Have you tried

448
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,959
reconfiguring the
plasma conduits?

449
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,458
Yes, Captain,
two hours ago.

450
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:57,667
What about the relays?

451
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,083
Are you absolutely
certain

452
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,667
that you don't need
a new phase inverter?

453
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,792
I am currently running
a level-three diagnostic

454
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:05,166
of the relays, sir.

455
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:07,125
We will have the results
of the analysis

456
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,291
in approximately
ten minutes.

457
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,375
(<i> sighing</i> )

458
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,208
I see.

459
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,709
Oh, perhaps I could
reconfigure

460
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,000
these isolinear chips.

461
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,458
No, sir--
please don't touch that.

462
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,291
Captain,
Commander Data and I

463
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,458
have the situation
under control.

464
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,875
Now, if you'd just let us
take care of it,

465
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:46,709
the work would go
much faster.

466
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,959
Captain, we could use
an extra hand

467
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,750
moving
the containment pods,

468
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,750
if it wouldn't be
an imposition.

469
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,542
Oh, no.
Not at all.

470
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,166
I'd be delighted.

471
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:01,083
Good work, Tyler.

472
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,083
I thought
he'd never leave.

473
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:04,917
Data, I want you
to give me a hand

474
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:07,166
locking down
this plasma con...

475
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,458

476
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,333
Data!

482
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,792
Hello, Data.

483
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,208
Are you all right?

484
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,000
What are you
doing?

485
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:18,750
Hold very still,
Counselor.

486
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:20,458
No!

487
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,333
(<i> screaming</i> )

488
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:26,166
Ever since you
gave Alexander
that music program,

489
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,792
he's been playing it
all night... every night!

490
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:31,000
I just wanted to
broaden his horizons.

491
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,458
Besides,
he likes it.

492
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,375
It is screeching,
pounding dissonance.

493
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:37,750
It is not music.

494
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:39,583
Worf, it's better
than music.

495
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:40,875
It's jazz.

496
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:42,834
(<i> door opens</i> )

497
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,750
Medical emergency,
deck 17,

498
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,250
section three alpha.

499
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,709
We're on our way.

500
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:59,667
I believe I had another waking
dream, sir.

501
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:02,417
but this time,
I had an uncontrollable urge

502
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,625
to eliminate
the image I saw.

503
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:07,625
And what you saw was
some sort of mouth

504
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,166
on Troi's shoulder.

505
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:10,583
Yes, sir.

506
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,291
And for a reason I
cannot explain

507
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:15,333
I had the need
to destroy it.

508
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,792
What about me?

509
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:18,750
Did you see one of those mouths
on my head as well?

510
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:20,834
No, sir, I saw a straw
coming out of your head.

511
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,959
A straw?
As I said before,

512
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,500
these are all images I
originally experienced

513
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:25,875
in my dream program.

514
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:29,166
I do not have
a rational explanation for them.

515
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,583
Mr. La Forge?

516
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,875
Captain, we've run
every possible diagnostic

517
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:34,417
on Data's positronic net
we can think of.

518
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,041
We can't find
anything wrong.

519
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,583
I could run
a sub-polymer scan,

520
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,750
but it would take some time
to set up the equipment.

521
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:42,875
Make it so.

522
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:46,667
In the meantime, Mr. Data,
I'll have to relieve you of duty

523
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:48,250
and confine you

524
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:49,792
to your quarters.

525
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:52,250
A sensible precaution,
sir.

526
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,375
Data...

527
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:07,291
(<i> panting</i> )

528
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,458
Deanna, you're
in Sick Bay.

529
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,709
It's all right.

530
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,959
Data...

531
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,667
He's not here.

532
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:15,667
Just try to relax.

533
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:20,667
This vascular pad
has healed the wound,

534
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:22,583
but you've lost
a lot of blood,

535
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,375
so I would like you
to lie still for a while.

536
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,166
That's odd.

537
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:30,875
There shouldn't be
any discoloration
after the treatment.

538
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:32,667
This looks like
some sort of rash.

539
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:33,959
What is it?

540
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,917
(<i> beeping</i> )

541
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:38,208
I'm picking up
cellular degradation

542
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,375
but it doesn't appear
to be related

543
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:42,875
to the lacerations.

544
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:44,542
There's also
some kind

545
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,291
of residual
interphasic signature.

546
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,667
Nurse.

547
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,166
Bring me an
interphasic scanner.

548
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,834
I want to take a
closer look at this.

549
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,375
Commander...

550
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:04,583
I will have to confiscate
your sidearm.

551
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,000
Of course.

552
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:17,542
May I ask
a personal favor?

553
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,041
Yes.

554
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,083
Will you take care
of Spot for me?

555
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:26,792
Your animal.

556
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:29,875
I'm afraid if I have
another waking dream

557
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:31,917
I might injure him.

558
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,417
Of course.

559
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:37,083
Spot,
come here.

560
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:40,333
Unlike a canine...

561
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:44,208
Spot does not respond
to verbal commands.

562
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,583
(<i> meowing</i> )

563
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,208
Good-bye, Spot.

564
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,542
(<i> meowing</i> )

565
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,875
He will need to be
fed once a day.

566
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:00,458
He prefers Feline
Supplement number 25.

567
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,000
I understand.

568
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:03,792
And he will
require water.

569
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:06,959
And you must provide
him with a sandbox.

570
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,709
And you must
talk to him.

571
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,542
Tell him he is
a pretty cat

572
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:13,375
and a good cat...

573
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:18,583
I will feed him.

574
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:21,208
Perhaps that
will be enough.

575
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,458
(<i> Worf sneezes, Spot meows</i> )

576
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:30,625
Captain, we have
a problem.

577
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:32,125
Take a look at this.

578
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:37,291
Her tissue is breaking down
on the cellular level

579
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,500
and it's spreading.

580
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:40,291
At first I thought
it was a rash

581
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,250
from the coil brace
she was stabbed with,

582
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:44,250
but when I used the
interphasic scanner,

583
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,625
I found this.

584
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:48,250
PICARD:
what is it?

585
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:51,333
The question is...

586
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:54,834
what are<i> they?</i>

587
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,834
I've tested all
the medical staff

588
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,291
and I've found them

589
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,458
on almost
everyone so far.

590
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,750
The cellular decay

591
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:11,458
is accelerating
in all cases.

592
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,333
I haven't found
a way to stop it

593
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:16,250
or even slow it down.

594
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:19,417
Looks like you're
infected, too.

595
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,750
The organisms appear
to be attached

596
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:24,959
to our epidermal layers
with osmotic tendrils.

597
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
They're tapping directly
into the bloodstream

598
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:30,917
and from what I can tell,
they're spreading.

599
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,709
RIKER:
What are we dealing with here?

600
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,000
Are these creatures
feeding on us?

601
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,000
Yes, in a very
particular way.

602
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,083
They appear to be extracting
our cellular peptides.

603
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,959
It's roughly analogous

604
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,625
to the way terran leeches
consume hemoglobin.

605
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:50,208
If they're
not removed soon,

606
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,000
our bodies are going to lose
all their cellular cohesion.

607
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:58,000
We'll collapse into nothing
but a few pounds of chemicals.

608
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:02,458
All right. Is there any way that
we can affect these organisms?

609
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
We've tried EM radiation,

610
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:06,875
subspace fields,
thermal protons--

611
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:08,417
Nothing's worked.

612
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:11,542
They seem to exist in some sort
of interphasic state

613
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:12,792
just beyond
our range

614
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:14,792
of visual and
sensor acuity.

615
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:17,375
The only way we can see them
is to use an I.P. scanner.

616
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:19,125
Tricorders can't even
pick them up.

617
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,500
Do we know where these
things came from, Mr. Worf?

618
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:24,291
Well, I scanned the vicinity
with an I.P. scanner.

619
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,750
There was no sign
of any similar creatures

620
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:28,542
or any unusual
interphasic activity.

621
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,041
PICARD:
What about Mr. Data?

622
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,792
There must be
some connection

623
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:34,834
between his odd behavior
and these creatures.

624
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,750
Is he infested
as well?

625
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:39,542
No, I scanned him,
but I found nothing.

626
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:42,792
Data attacked
Counselor Troi

627
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:45,959
because he saw...
a mouth on her shoulder

628
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,500
and it was
in that same area

629
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,458
that we first saw
one of the organisms.

630
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,834
RIKER:
Data also saw
a straw in my head

631
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:54,625
and then Beverly discovered
an organism in the same place.

632
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,458
Those images are all part
of Data's dream.

633
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,250
Maybe somehow he's unconsciously
perceiving these creatures.

634
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,291
Then perhaps it is time

635
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,417
that we took a closer look
at Mr. Data's dreams.

636
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,959
It is an interesting
hypothesis.

637
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,291
If I am being
affected

638
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,166
by these interphasic
creatures

639
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,625
on an unconscious level,

640
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,041
it may also explain
my waking dreams

641
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:20,041
and my subsequent
antisocial behavior.

642
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,166
What we want to do,
Data,

643
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:24,583
is link your neural net
to the holodeck

644
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:26,834
and have you activate
your dream program

645
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:29,667
so as you dream,
we can observe
the dream images.

646
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:32,166
Perhaps we can learn more
about these creatures

647
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:35,166
by interpreting the symbols
and images of your dreams.

648
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,792
I see.

649
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:38,959
The concept is similar to
the method of directed dreaming.

650
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,834
Exactly. How soon
can you have the
link ready?

651
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,250
We'll need
about an hour

652
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,959
to establish all
the interface parameters.

653
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,417
Make it so.

654
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,208
In the meantime, Mr. Data,

655
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,834
I suggest that
you should prepare for bed.

656
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:03,000
I think we're ready,
Captain.

657
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:04,417
The link is active

658
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:07,083
and the holodeck
has been calibrated

659
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:08,709
to Data's neural net.

660
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:11,750
Ready,
Mr. Data?

661
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:13,250
Yes, sir.

662
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:17,083
Normally, I would
wish you pleasant dreams,

663
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,625
but in this case,

664
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:21,166
bad dreams would
be more helpful.

665
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:24,083
I understand, sir.

666
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:26,000
Initiating
dream program.

667
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,041
Stand by.

668
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,959
Let's be very
observant.

669
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,792
Even the most
insignificant image

670
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:39,709
could be a very
important symbol.

671
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,291
Right.

672
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,792
Here he comes.

673
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,375
Hello.

674
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:53,500
Can we speak
to Data directly

675
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:54,917
or would that
wake him up?

676
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,458
He should be
perceiving us

677
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,125
as just another part
of his dream.

678
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:00,125
Anything we say to him

679
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,709
will be taken
in that context.

680
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,250
You know, that sounds
like a telephone ringer,

681
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:05,834
but I don't see
a receiver.

682
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,417
(<i> door opens</i> )

683
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:22,709
Cake?

684
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,458
Oh, thank you.

685
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:29,625
Look at that.

686
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:31,083
Her right shoulder.

687
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:33,458
That is the same place
that Data stabbed her.

688
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,875
In his waking dream

689
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:37,625
he said that there was
a mouth on her shoulder.

690
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:40,083
They're both symbols
of consumption--

691
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,125
Mouth, food.

692
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:46,250
Mr. Data, what kind
of cake is this?

693
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:49,125
It is a cellular peptide
cake.

694
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,458
With mint frosting.

695
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,250
Cellular peptides?
That's exactly what the
creatures are extracting.

696
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:55,875
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

697
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,959
RIKER:
Will someone answer
that damn ringing?

698
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,917
(<i> ringing gets louder</i> )

699
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,542
Captain, the ringing
is getting worse.

700
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,291
What could the
ringing symbolize?

701
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:14,417
A bell?
A sound?

702
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,792
An old-fashioned way
of communicating?

703
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,333
Do you
want some?

704
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,417
It's delicious.

705
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:23,375
Will someone
please get that?

706
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,959
Yes?

707
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,333
It's for you.

708
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,417
Picard.

709
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:47,917
FREUD:
Kill them.

710
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,375
Kill who?

711
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:52,417
FREUD:
Kill them before it's too late.

712
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,166
Who is this?

713
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:57,125
I am
Dr. Sigmund Freud.

714
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:07,709
How does he fit
into all this?

715
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:12,500
If I were to interpret
my own appearance in this dream

716
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:16,125
I would say I am
the symbolic representation

717
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:20,000
of Data's unconscious mind
trying to warn him

718
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:23,458
about the dangers
he perceives around him.

719
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,875
You mean
the interphasic organisms?

720
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:27,333
Of course.

721
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,750
Tell me, Doctor,
how do we kill them?

722
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:32,125
(<i> ringing begins</i> )

723
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:34,625
Answer it.

724
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,208
<i>Nein, nein!</i>

725
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,583
<i>Nein.</i>

726
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,792
Do not be so literal.

727
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:46,458
When I say "answer it,"
I mean respond to it, to them.

728
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,834
(<i> door opens</i> )

729
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,208
Be quiet!

730
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:55,041
(<i> groaning</i> )

731
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:01,458
(<i> grunting</i> )

732
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:11,542
PICARD:
What do they represent?

733
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:12,750
I don't know,

734
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:15,375
but I do recognize
that junction

735
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,291
they're working on.

736
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,375
It's the plasma
conduit we installed

737
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:20,709
with the new
warp core.

738
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,000
Respond.

739
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:24,166
Respond to them?

740
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:25,834
What does
that mean?

741
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,834
What is it
that you're doing?

742
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:32,083
Go away.

743
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,458
Leave us alone.

744
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,041
Who are you?

745
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,166
We are...

746
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:44,375
...your enemies.

747
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:48,417
Stop!

748
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,333
You must not
hurt my friends.

749
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,750
(<i> high-pitched shrieking</i> )

750
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:54,917
Be quiet!

751
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,375
PICARD:
Data...

752
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:57,834
the shrieking noise
you made--

753
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,750
It causes them pain.

754
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,125
(<i> shrieking continues</i> )

755
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:04,000
Be... quiet!

756
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:17,417
(<i> shrieking stops</i> )

757
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,375
I believe I understand.

758
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:31,709
Geordi.
Yes, Data.

759
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,667
You must adjust
my positronic subprocessor

760
00:40:33,709 --> 00:40:36,166
to emit
an interphasic pulse.

761
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,875
Data, what's
going on?

762
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:42,834
The workmen in my dreams
represent the organisms

763
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,291
which are trying
to demolish the ship.

764
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,458
The incessant ringing
of the telephone,

765
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,458
Dr. Freud's cautions
at the other end

766
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,375
were warnings
of the dangers around us.

767
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:53,291
What about the shrieking
noises that you made?

768
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,083
My positronic
subprocessor detected

769
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,041
high-frequency
interphasic signatures

770
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:58,458
from the organisms,

771
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,834
which are symbolically
represented in my dreams

772
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,250
by a high shriek.

773
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:04,291
When you made
those noises

774
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,458
the workmen
reacted in pain.

775
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,000
That is why
I have asked Geordi

776
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,792
to adjust
my subprocessor.

777
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,500
If I can produce a
high-frequency interphasic pulse

778
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:14,875
it may have a similar effect
on the creatures.

779
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:16,083
We're ready.

780
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,500
Picard to Sick Bay.

781
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,291
Beverly, we'll going to
be sweeping the ship

782
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,375
with a high-frequency
I.P. pulse.

783
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:24,083
Will you monitor
the creatures
for any reaction?

784
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,500
CRUSHER:
Understood.

785
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,917
(<i> high-pitched shrieking</i> begins)

786
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:38,834
(<i> I.P. scanner whirring</i> )

787
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,333
It's working,
Captain.

788
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,375
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

789
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:53,792
<i>The creatures infesting</i>
<i>the</i> Enterprise

790
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:56,000
<i>have been completely</i>
<i>eliminated.</i>

791
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:58,750
<i>We believe</i>
<i>the infestation originated</i>

792
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:02,208
<i>within the warp core</i>
<i>we obtained on Starbase 84.</i>

793
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,083
This conduit was manufactured
on Thanatos VII,

794
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:07,250
using a new interphasic
fusion process.

795
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,667
We think
it was that process

796
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,625
which attracted the organisms
to the conduit

797
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:13,333
where they lay dormant
until we activated
the warp core.

798
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,458
That's also why we couldn't
get the core on line.

799
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,417
The creatures were disrupting
the plasma flow.

800
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:20,125
How long before we have
warp power again?

801
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:22,375
Well, we're going to have
to manufacture a new conduit.

802
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,083
That's at least
six hours' work.

803
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,208
Six hours?

804
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,375
The banquet will be
completely over by then.

805
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:29,792
That's very
unfortunate.

806
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:31,041
I could try and
speed things up a bit.

807
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:34,250
No, no!
No. Uh...

808
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:36,709
I wouldn't want
to sacrifice

809
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,667
the safety
of the ship.

810
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:40,458
Understood, sir.

811
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:45,250
(<i> door chimes</i> )

812
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:46,583
Enter.

813
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:51,083
Counselor.

814
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:54,417
I did not have
a chance to apologize

815
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:55,667
for my actions.

816
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:58,583
Data...
don't worry about it.

817
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:01,083
Geordi explained
everything to me.

818
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,792
It wasn't
your fault.

819
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:12,583
But, somehow, I thought
turnabout would be fair play,

820
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:16,625
so... I made us a little
something to snack on.

821
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,875
I wonder...

822
00:43:32,917 --> 00:43:35,000
What would Dr. Freud say

823
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:38,083
about the symbolism
of devouring oneself?

824
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:40,250
Data...

825
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:43,333
sometimes a cake
is just a cake.
