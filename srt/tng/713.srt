00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:05,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47423.9:</i>

2
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:07,667
<i>We have arrived</i>
<i>at Boraal II</i>

3
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,750
<i>in response to</i>
<i>an emergency distress call</i>

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,500
<i>from Lieutenant Worf's foster</i>
<i>brother, Nikolai Rozhenko.</i>

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,542
<i>He has been stationed on the</i>
<i>planet as a cultural observer.</i>

6
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,542
Analysis, Mr. Data.

7
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:21,250
The planet's atmosphere
is dissipating, sir.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,250
Intense plasmonic reactions
are destroying it.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,875
The stratosphere is
already breaking down.

10
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,083
There are turbulent
radiation storms

11
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,792
across much of
its surface.

12
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:33,083
I estimate that the planet
will be uninhabitable

13
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,583
in less than 38 hours.

14
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,583
The distress call
came in only four days ago.

15
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,792
Why would Dr. Rozhenko
have waited

16
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:41,875
so long
before sending it?

17
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,417
Atmospheric dissipation
is a rare and essentially
unpredictable event.

18
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,333
When it occurs,
it proceeds rapidly.

19
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,792
Dr. Rozhenko may not have
had sufficient warning.

20
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:53,083
What was that?

21
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,834
The dissipation effect

22
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,959
is generating
plasmonic energy bursts.

23
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,792
Is there any danger
to the ship?

24
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,417
I do not believe so.

25
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:03,208
However, we may experience
intermittent system failures

26
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,166
and power surges
as a result.

27
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,583
Keep an eye on it.

28
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,583
Mr. Worf, any luck?

29
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,625
There is still no response
to our hails, sir.

30
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,250
I'm attempting to scan
the observation post.

31
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,959
He could be hurt.
Maybe he can't respond.

32
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,250
WORF: Sensor interference
is significant,

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,709
but the post appears
to be intact.

34
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,333
Their power grid
is still functioning.

35
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:29,417
However, I am reading no
life-forms within the structure.

36
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:32,625
It's not like him
to leave the post.

37
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,458
Especially under
these circumstances.

38
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,375
Captain, I'm detecting
faint power emissions

39
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,583
from a system of caverns
near the post.

40
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,250
It could be
a deflector shield.

41
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,208
They can't be native
to the planet.

42
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,083
The Boraalans
don't have anything close

43
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,208
to that level
of technology.

44
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,417
Captain, request permission
to lead an away team.

45
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:53,083
Very well.

46
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,000
But regardless of this
planet's immediate situation,

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,250
we must observe
the Prime Directive.

48
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,000
I want to minimize

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,959
the risk of contact
with the inhabitants.

50
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,667
You will go down alone,
Mr. Worf,

51
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,417
and I want to have you
surgically altered

52
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,208
so that you could pass
as a Boraalan.

53
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,083
Aye, sir.

54
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:21,083
You're worried about
Nikolai, aren't you?

55
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,333
Yes.

56
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,500
Are the two of you close?

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,875
We are brothers.

58
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:32,542
You never talk much about him.
What's he like?

59
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:35,792
Nikolai is older than I

60
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:38,709
and we are not alike.

61
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,458
We had many disagreements
when we were growing up.

62
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,375
That's not unusual.

63
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,875
Nikolai has
a mind of his own.

64
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,792
He attended
Starfleet Academy,

65
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:54,458
but he was unable
to follow the rules.

66
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,500
He left after one year.

67
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,709
But he has many
fine qualities.

68
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,125
He's brilliant,
persuasive...

69
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,208
a natural leader.

70
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:11,041
Sounds intriguing.
I look forward to meeting him.

71
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,500
MAN:
What are you doing here?

72
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:40,417
You're not from
our village.

73
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:43,208
Who are you?

74
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,166
Who is this?

75
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,792
My name is Worf.

76
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,500
I am a traveler.

77
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,917
How did you
survive the storms?

78
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,458
MAN: I would know
that voice anywhere.

79
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,000
Worf, is it really you?

80
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,959
It's good to see you.

81
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,208
You've changed a lot
in four years.

82
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,917
Nikolai?

83
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,542
Yes.
(<i> laughing</i> )

84
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,250
Oh, Worf.

85
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,250
This is my brother, Worf.
He's come to help us.

86
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:52,458
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

87
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:56,458
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

88
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,333
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

89
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:02,250
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

90
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,709
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

91
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:11,542
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

92
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:10,458
But if you were able
to get here,

93
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,792
the storms
must have subsided.
Please...

94
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you think it's safe enough
to return to the surface?

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,417
Please, I must speak
to my brother.

96
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:25,166
Nikolai,
what have you done?

97
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,750
They were dying.

98
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,375
I refused to sit there safe

99
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,333
in that observation post
and watch it happen.

100
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,083
I set up a deflector shield
to screen these caves

101
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,667
from the radiation
and then I brought them here.

102
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,458
What did you tell them?

103
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,917
They think I'm a Boraalan.

104
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:40,834
I told them I was from
another village far from here.

105
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,041
Well, at least you
had that much sense.

106
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,542
When I sent
the distress call,

107
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:46,125
I knew the<i> Enterprise</i> 
was in this sector,

108
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,792
but I wasn't sure
you'd be the one to come.

109
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,417
I'm so glad that
you're here, Worf.

110
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:54,041
Nikolai, there is nothing
we can do for these people.

111
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,291
You have only postponed
their deaths.

112
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,500
I want to discuss that
with your captain.

113
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,667
And I am certain he will
want to speak with you.

114
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:07,750
Friends, my brother and I
must go back to the surface.

115
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,291
He has provisions and will
need help bringing them here.

116
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,041
We will return
shortly.

117
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,333
It's too dangerous.

118
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,083
The storms can occur
without warning.

119
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,792
If you're caught in one...
Don't worry. Worf is a seer.

120
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,875
He understands the nature
of the storms.

121
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,375
He'll know when
it's safe to travel.

122
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,792
Yes.
That is correct.

123
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,542
Our seer died when
the storms first came.

124
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:31,125
We've been without
his guidance for many weeks.

125
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,417
Let me go with you.

126
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:36,125
I know the terrain better than
anyone and I can help.

127
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,792
No, Vorin.
Worf and I will be safe.

128
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,583
We'll return shortly.

129
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,667
Doctor, you were fully aware

130
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:52,917
that the atmospheric dissipation
could not be stopped.

131
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:56,250
What did you hope to accomplish
by assisting these people?

132
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,834
I was trying to give
them a future.

133
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,750
What I propose is

134
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,875
we create an atmospheric
shield on the planet.

135
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,583
We can camouflage
the equipment

136
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,291
just as was done
with my observation post.

137
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,583
No one will ever
know it's there.

138
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,834
You can't be serious.

139
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:10,333
Indeed, I am.

140
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,041
I realize it will
only provide atmosphere

141
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,709
for a limited area
on the surface,

142
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:16,792
but it will be enough
to save one village.

143
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:19,125
I have no intention of
compounding what you have done

144
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,125
by committing another
gross violation of
the Prime Directive.

145
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,375
Captain,
the Boraalans have

146
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,834
a rich and beautiful culture,
a deep spiritual life.

147
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:31,000
They deserve the chance
to survive,

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,250
and isn't that
what the Prime Directive

149
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,291
was truly
intended to do--

150
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,750
to allow cultures to survive
and grow naturally?

151
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,917
Not exactly.

152
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,000
The Prime Directive
was designed

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,625
to insure noninterference.

154
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,208
But aren't we interfering
either way?

155
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:49,333
If we take no action,
it's a conscious decision
to let the Boraalans die.

156
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,625
Exactly.

157
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,959
We have the power
to save some of them.

158
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,792
All we have to do
is exercise it.

159
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:58,375
We are sworn to
uphold the principle
of the Prime Directive.

160
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,917
And until that is changed,
there is no further course
of action that we can take.

161
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,208
Is that understood?

162
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,834
Some of my...

163
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:12,250
log recorders are still
in my observation post.

164
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,834
They contain
most of my research.

165
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:16,834
Since it appears
that the only way,

166
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,750
I'm going to preserve
the Boraalan culture

167
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,333
is in a museum...

168
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,709
I request permission

169
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,709
to return to the surface
and retrieve them.

170
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:28,333
I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

171
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,291
But you can have full use
of the ship's computer

172
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,834
to set up a com link
and upload your data from here.

173
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:38,000
If there's nothing further,
you're dismissed.

174
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,500
I am sorry, Nikolai.

175
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,208
I wish there were
another way.

176
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,500
I am quite familiar with
your communications systems.

177
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,250
If you like, I will help you
set up your com link.

178
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,500
I'll do it myself.

179
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:18,792
Captain, atmospheric
dissipation has accelerated

180
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,875
over the past
several hours.

181
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,792
I estimate
the planet's atmosphere

182
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,750
will be completely gone
within three minutes.

183
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,166
Captain, I've completed
my data uplink.

184
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,625
With your permission,
I would like to integrate

185
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,333
my research logs with
the ship's library computer.

186
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,709
Of course.

187
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:38,083
DATA:
The mesosphere is gone, sir.

188
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,959
Plasmonic reactions
are now beginning

189
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,041
to break down
the troposphere.

190
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,125
Put it on screen.

191
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,792
What's going on?

192
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,709
It appears
the plasmonic reactions

193
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,625
are continuing to interfere
with our sensors.

194
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,458
I thought you had
compensated for that.

195
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,208
I had, sir.

196
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,917
I will attempt to engage
additional filtering elements.

197
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,417
Visual reestablished.

198
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:15,875
This is one
of those times...

199
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,792
when we must face
the ramifications

200
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:24,709
of the Prime Directive
and honor those lives

201
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,917
which we cannot save.

202
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:30,583
I find no honor in this
whatsoever, Captain.

203
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:36,000
You will forgive me
if I don't stay.

204
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:59,166
You have the Bridge,
Number One.

205
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,250
Helm, take us
out of orbit.

206
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,542
Set a course for
Starbase 87, warp five.

207
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,333
HELM:
Aye, sir.

208
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,417
What happened?

209
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,792
There appears to be
an unusual power drain

210
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:15,417
in the EPS distribution net.

211
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:18,166
RIKER: What's the source?
Unknown, sir.

212
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,166
It is difficult
to localize.

213
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,875
The power drain is registered on
my security grid as well, sir.

214
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,166
It appears to be coming
from Deck ten.

215
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,458
All right, Mr. Worf,
get a security team on it.

216
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,083
Aye, sir.

217
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:35,333
Concentrate your scans
on the EPS transfer links.

218
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:52,458
Computer,
open Holodeck five.

219
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,291
COMPUTER:
Unable to comply.

220
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,125
Holodeck five is in use.

221
00:12:56,125 --> 00:13:00,166
Override. Authorization:
Worf-theta-six-one-nine.

222
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,208
COMPUTER:
Unable to comply.

223
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,083
Holodeck control systems
have been bypassed.

224
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,083
NIKOLAI:
Worf, come in.

225
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,417
Nikolai?

226
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,667
What are you
doing here?

227
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,875
I have something
to show you.

228
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,959
Whatever you do,
stay quiet.

229
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,291
Look.

230
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,500
I've done what you
refused to do.

231
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,542
I've saved them.

232
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,083
NIKOLAI: I started thinking
about this days ago

233
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,083
when it became clear
the planet was doomed.

234
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,750
I knew if I could gain access
to your ship's computer,

235
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,750
I could generate
a replica of the caves.

236
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,709
The hard part was transporting
the Boraalans into the Holodeck

237
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,917
without anybody on
the<i> Enterprise</i> noticing.

238
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,750
But I was able
to blank out the sensors

239
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,667
and make it look
like interference from
the plasmonic bursts.

240
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,667
And it worked...
perfectly.

241
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:22,834
The Boraalans were transported
while they were sleeping.

242
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:24,959
They never knew
anything had happened.

243
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,083
Bridge.

244
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,709
It's a simple plan, really,
that's the beauty of it.

245
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:34,750
Worf, trust me.
This is going to work.

246
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,583
Trust you?

247
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,000
You never had any intention
of obeying the captain.

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,417
I wasn't going to let
those people die

249
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:44,208
just because your captain
started quoting

250
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,792
Federation dogma to me.

251
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:48,041
Your duty was to respect
the captain's orders

252
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,250
and to uphold
the Prime Directive.

253
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,125
Duty?

254
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,083
That's all that really
matters to you, isn't it?

255
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,709
Well, I refuse to be bound
by an abstraction.

256
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,792
The lives of
the people of Boraal

257
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:00,333
are far more important
to me.

258
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,542
You worry too much, Worf.
You always did.

259
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,625
Everything will work out.

260
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,125
You have disgraced
yourself.

261
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,542
And you have
disgraced me.

262
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,834
And I want nothing more
to do with you.

263
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,375
You realize your career
is finished.

264
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,625
I know that, Captain,
and I would do it all again.

265
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,542
What do you expect us
to do now?

266
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:27,166
You have left us
with a colony of Boraalans

267
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,333
who think they're still
on their own planet.

268
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,291
I didn't beam them up
without a plan.

269
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,041
I've given this
a lot of thought.

270
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,750
I think we can find
a new planet,

271
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,000
an M-class world
that can be their new home.

272
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,500
A home which would look
very different from Boraal.

273
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,625
You can't really believe
that they'll be fooled.

274
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,709
That's where
the Holodeck comes in.

275
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,291
I'll go back and tell
the Boraalans we're
going on a journey

276
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,959
to a different place where
they'll be safe from the storms.

277
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,333
The Holodeck can gradually
change the terrain as we travel

278
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,000
so that, in the end,
the Holodeck simulation

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,417
will match the conditions
on the new planet.

280
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,542
Then we'll simply
beam them down.

281
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,709
What if it doesn't work?

282
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,417
What if they become aware

283
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,458
that something strange
is going on?

284
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,417
Captain, I can't prepare
for every contingency,

285
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:14,250
but I assure you, I'm accustomed
to thinking on my feet.

286
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,625
I'll deal with
the situation as it evolves.

287
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:23,542
I'm not enthusiastic
about this plan,

288
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:27,333
but I don't see
that we have another option.

289
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,917
Very well,
let's give it a try.

290
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,709
Thank you, Captain.

291
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,291
There are countless
M-class planets

292
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,667
in Federation space
that can support the Boraalans.

293
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,542
We need to narrow
the parameters.

294
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:46,500
It will take approximately 9 1/2
hours to complete the analysis.

295
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Even then, there's
no guarantee that we'll
find a suitable planet.

296
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,917
That is correct, sir.

297
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:53,834
Captain, you'd better
take a look at this.

298
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:56,333
What is it?
We've got a problem, sir.

299
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,208
I don't think
it's going to be possible

300
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,375
to keep this Holodeck
simulation stable.

301
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,792
PICARD: Why not?
LA FORGE:
The plasmonic energy bursts

302
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:05,000
from the planet are affecting
the ship's systems.

303
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,917
We're having problems
with the EPS systems

304
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,458
and the power
distribution matrix.

305
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,500
And as a result,
the Holodeck imaging processor

306
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,291
has been
severely destabilized.

307
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,458
It's not a question
of<i> whether</i> the simulation

308
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,875
will break down,
it's a question of when.

309
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,083
There's no way around it?
Not while it's running.

310
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,917
In order to fix it, I'd have to
shut down all of the Holodecks

311
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,250
and re-initialize
the entire system.

312
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,959
That will take hours.

313
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,875
We'll just have to hope the
simulation holds long enough.

314
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,625
Very well,
let's try it.

315
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,291
Mr. La Forge, I want you to
monitor the situation

316
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,834
very carefully and keep an open
com link with the Holodeck

317
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:41,583
so as to be apprised
of any problems.
Aye, sir.

318
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,625
Captain, I'll return
to the Holodeck

319
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,542
as soon as my surgical
alterations are completed

320
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:48,000
and I'll prepare the Boraalans
for their journey.

321
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,041
Considering the situation
you have put us in,

322
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,333
I don't think it's wise to leave
you alone with those people.

323
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,417
Mr. Worf will accompany you.

324
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,542
Sir, perhaps someone else
would be a better choice.

325
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:01,542
Counselor Troi
is familiar with...

326
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,333
Mr. Worf, the Boraalans
already know you.

327
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,291
There's no need to introduce
them to anyone new.

328
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:08,417
Aye, sir.

329
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,500
Keep a close eye
on your brother.

330
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,417
I don't want him making
this situation worse than it is.

331
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,750
My friends,
we have returned.

332
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,500
We have food.

333
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This is difficult to say,
but you have a right to hear it.

334
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,500
By the time Worf and I
had reached the surface,

335
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,125
the village was gone.

336
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,208
The storms have
destroyed everything.

337
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,375
There is nothing left
for us to return to.

338
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,375
We can't survive in here.

339
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,917
Our supplies won't
last forever.

340
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,583
That's why we must leave.

341
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,583
There is a place far from here
where there are no storms.

342
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,250
It will be
a difficult journey,

343
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,125
but, in the end,
we will have a new home.

344
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,375
I know a way
through the caves.

345
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,875
We will travel safely
until we return to the surface.

346
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,458
Where is this new land?

347
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,083
As we said,
it is far from here.

348
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,792
It will not be like
the home you knew.

349
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,709
Even the stars
may be different.

350
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:18,250
Why would they be different?

351
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,333
And how do you know
we'll be safe there?

352
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,125
My brother is a seer.

353
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,709
If he says we'll be safe,

354
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,500
you must trust
that we will be safe.

355
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,750
(<i> woman screams</i> )

356
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,083
What's wrong?
Look!

357
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,375
Do not worry.
It is an omen.

358
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,125
What does it mean?

359
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,542
It is the sign...

360
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:52,333
of La Forge.

361
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,291
It is a message
to travelers.

362
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,875
It is said when these lines
appear and disappear

363
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,375
in a pool of water,
the road ahead

364
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,542
will be filled
with good fortune.

365
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,750
Hang in there, Worf.

366
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,458
Give me just a second...

367
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,709
there.

368
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,250
That should do it.

369
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,709
You see? Our journey
is already blessed.

370
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:30,417
The road ahead is long.

371
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,709
Let us have a meal together,

372
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:34,333
then we'll make
preparations to leave.

373
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,917
Worf, very good work.

374
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:44,417
Apparently, we don't make
such a bad team after all.

375
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:47,125
We are not a team.

376
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,500
I am here because Captain
Picard ordered me here.

377
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,959
Worf, don't we both
share the same goal?

378
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,792
Aren't we both trying
to make this plan work?

379
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:56,917
Only because you
forced us into it.

380
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,417
I'm not ashamed
of what I did.

381
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:00,208
I'm not sorry
I saved their lives.

382
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,583
You have not changed.

383
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:07,208
You still expect people to
solve the problems you create.

384
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,333
I'm not here to work out
the issues of our childhood.

385
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,583
I'm here to save a people,
who I care about,

386
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:16,083
and if that upsets<i> you,</i> 
then so be it.

387
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:25,417
DATA:
These are the two planets which
best match our search criteria.

388
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:29,125
Draygo IV features an unusually
large temperate zone.

389
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,792
However, it is within three
light-years of Cardassian space.

390
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,875
There are constant border
disputes in that sector.

391
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,959
The alternative
is Vacca VI.

392
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,667
It is located in
the Cabral sector.

393
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,500
That's pretty isolated.

394
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,834
It offers a less
hospitable climate

395
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:46,750
than the Boraalans
are accustomed to.

396
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,291
However, it would still appear
to be the better choice.

397
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,709
Do you disagree,
Doctor?

398
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:54,500
No, Data, you're right.

399
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,125
It's just that the enormity
of what we're doing
is overwhelming.

400
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:00,000
We are deciding
the future of a species.

401
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,291
It is a formidable
responsibility.

402
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,291
There are so many questions
we don't have answers to.

403
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,792
What if the climate is so
different that it affects them

404
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,875
in a way that
we can't anticipate?

405
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,917
How do we even know
they'll be able to survive?

406
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:15,250
And if they do,
how would their society evolve

407
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,917
and what impact will it have
on the Vaccan system?

408
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:20,125
We have no idea
what this decision

409
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,000
will mean
to their future.

410
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,333
Doctor, I do not believe
we can offer any guarantees.

411
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,083
We can simply make the best
choice we have at the moment.

412
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:32,458
All right, Data.

413
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,166
Vacca VI it is.

414
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,959
Data to Bridge.
Picard here.

415
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:39,750
We have located a new home
for the Boraalans, sir.

416
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,583
It is Vacca VI
in the Cabral sector.

417
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:48,709
We can reach that in 42 hours
at maximum warp, sir.
Very well.

418
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,959
Helm, set course
for Vacca VI.
HELM: Aye, sir.

419
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,000
(<i> laughing</i> )

420
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,834
What is this?

421
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:27,542
Our chronicle.

422
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:31,542
The history
of our village?

423
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:34,083
Doesn't your village
keep a chronicle?

424
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,834
Not in this manner.

425
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:38,500
Then how do you teach your
children their history--

426
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,583
who their ancestors were,
where they come from?

427
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:45,417
We tell each other stories...

428
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,291
make up songs.

429
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:51,750
Stories change with
each person who tells them...

430
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:54,500
but this--

431
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,667
this will always
be the same.

432
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:00,083
Our chronicle
has been maintained

433
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:03,417
for 17 generations.

434
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:06,583
I was only able to
save the last six.

435
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:13,000
This shows the destruction
of our village.

436
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,500
This is you and Nikolai
leading us to safety.

437
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,542
We must leave.

438
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:28,500
Gather your belongings.

439
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,125
One of the scrolls is gone.

440
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,917
I must have dropped it
in the passageway.

441
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,792
I'll go find it.

442
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,125
We must stay together.

443
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,375
You will have
to leave it behind.

444
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:54,208
Worf, the chronicle
is the life of our village.

445
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:58,166
Without that past,
our future means nothing.

446
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,250
I must find it.

447
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,000
Go.
And return quickly.

448
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,166
Seer.

449
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,834
I am an old man.

450
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:17,291
Would you help me
with my gear?

451
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:19,125
Of course.

452
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:27,208
That is Tarrana,
my daughter.

453
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:29,333
I am fortunate
she was old enough

454
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,583
to survive the storms.

455
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,208
She is a fine girl.

456
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:36,000
Oh, she is
a beautiful girl.

457
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,667
She has not been
promised to anyone.

458
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:43,083
If I do not reach
our new home,

459
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,333
I would like her
to become your wife.

460
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,792
You<i> will</i> reach your new home.

461
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:57,709
I promise.

462
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:17,166
(<i> buzzing</i> )

463
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,750
Can I help you?

464
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,542
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

465
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,834
Are you okay?
Do you need some help?

466
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,792
It's okay.

467
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,208
Take it easy.

468
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:54,959
All right, everybody,
back off. Back off.

469
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:07,583
I know things must look
very strange to you,

470
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:10,625
but everything's going
to be all right.

471
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:14,542
No one's going
to hurt you.

472
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:18,333
We're friends
of Nikolai and Worf.

473
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,458
Don't be afraid.

474
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:23,959
Nikolai?
Yes.

475
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:25,959
He's my friend,

476
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:28,208
and that means you are, too.

477
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,208
I promise.
I won't hurt you.

478
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:37,125
Please... help me.

479
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,083
Where am I?

480
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,458
I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.

481
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:56,333
His neurophysiology
is very unusual.

482
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,041
I can't wipe his memory.

483
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,625
I see. How is he?

484
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:00,917
As well as can be expected.

485
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:02,291
I've given him
a mild sedative

486
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:04,208
and Troi's been
speaking with him

487
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,333
and he seems much calmer.

488
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,166
Does he understand
the situation?
I think so.

489
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,375
Contact Mr. Worf.

490
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,959
Make sure that he knows
what's going on.

491
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:16,250
TROI:
Here he is now.

492
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:20,041
This is Captain Picard.

493
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,291
Vorin, isn't it?

494
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,542
Why did you
bring us here?

495
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:27,583
Your planet was dying.

496
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:30,041
It could no longer
support life.

497
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:32,417
We took you away from it.

498
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:34,333
But...

499
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,458
we never left the caves.

500
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,875
We have the ability

501
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:43,583
to create the illusion
of other places,

502
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,375
like the caves
on your planet.

503
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:49,709
You've actually spent
the last two days

504
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:52,500
here on this starship,
not on Boraal.

505
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,542
Then our home... is gone.

506
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,542
Yes.

507
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:05,250
PICARD:
Vorin, listen to me.

508
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,792
We can visit
many other worlds.

509
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:11,500
We can take you to one
where you can build a new life.

510
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,375
A new life?

511
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:16,000
A chance for your culture,

512
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,542
your people
to survive and grow.

513
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:22,709
How can we grow

514
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:26,375
when everything that made us
who we are is gone?

515
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,542
Dobara,
you go on ahead.

516
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:05,875
I will carry your pack.

517
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,750
Go and join the others.

518
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,750
Thank you, seer.

519
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:23,291
It will be dark soon--
a few hours.

520
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,542
Would you ask
Mr. La Forge

521
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:32,500
to create a suitable
campsite for us

522
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,792
a few kilometers
from here?

523
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:34,959
What's wrong?

524
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,500
Vorin has left
the Holodeck.

525
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,834
How did he get out?
I do not know.

526
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:42,417
But Dr. Crusher cannot
erase his memory.

527
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,208
What will they do
with him?

528
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,000
They've explained
the situation to him.

529
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,041
He must make
his own decisions.
Wait.

530
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:52,709
Are you saying that
if Vorin wants to come back
in here, they'll let him?

531
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:55,959
That is right.
He is not a prisoner.

532
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:58,250
But if he comes back here
and tells the others

533
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,834
what he has seen
on the<i> Enterprise,</i>

534
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,375
everything we have done
will be for nothing.

535
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,000
Then you should have
considered that

536
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,834
before you beamed them
on board.

537
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:07,458
But you never think of
the consequences of<i> your</i> acts.

538
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,458
If you mean by that that
I'm willing to do something

539
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,583
while others hesitate,
that's true.

540
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:14,291
Everywhere you go,
you create chaos.

541
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:17,083
How many times did our parents
lie awake at night

542
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:18,750
wondering what kind of
trouble you were in?

543
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,750
Oh, if only I could
have been like you--

544
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,333
Worf, the perfect son!

545
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:26,458
I was not perfect, but I
was not wild and disobedient.

546
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:29,166
Of course not, you were
too busy doing your duty.

547
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,834
I would rather
be accused of that

548
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:32,875
than making
our mother weep.

549
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,208
But I see it is clear,

550
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:35,834
you have no intention
of changing.

551
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:38,041
I see no reason
to discuss it further.

552
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,625
Commander, the Holodeck
malfunctions are increasing.

553
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,667
I'm running every
stabilization routine I know.

554
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:18,375
WORF: How much longer
until we reach the new planet?

555
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,166
We'll be there in less
than eight hours.

556
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,792
You're just going to have
to hold things together

557
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,208
a little while longer.

558
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,792
WORF:
Someone is coming.

559
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,542
May I speak with you?

560
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,625
Yes, of course.

561
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,750
I don't know what
Nikolai said to you,

562
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:50,917
but please...
forgive him?

563
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:54,417
It is an old argument.

564
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:57,458
I've never seen him
like this.

565
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:59,375
He's usually so...

566
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:01,417
confident,
so sure of himself.

567
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:05,208
But now he seems...
different.

568
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:07,834
Do you know why?

569
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,750
No. No, I do not.

570
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,458
Ever since Vorin was lost,

571
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:18,125
people have been afraid--

572
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:21,208
worried that we won't
reach our new home.

573
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:24,959
We need Nikolai's strength
now more than ever.

574
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:27,709
When the storms
first came to our village,

575
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:30,417
many of us
were ready to die,

576
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:33,750
but Nikolai refused
to let us.

577
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,333
He gathered us together
and led us into caves.

578
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,375
He saved us.

579
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,792
He is a brave

580
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,000
and compassionate man

581
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,333
and I love him.

582
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,250
Please...

583
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,250
go to him.

584
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,458
Make things right
between you.

585
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,542
I want us to be a family.

586
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:58,041
Us?

587
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,792
Yes.

588
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:03,458
I want you to consider
yourself my brother.

589
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:05,792
After all...

590
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:13,625
...you're going to be
the uncle of my child.

591
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:35,625
We are in synchronous orbit
over the beam-down site, sir.

592
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:36,750
Good.

593
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,125
Mr. La Forge,
how much longer

594
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,250
before we can transport
the Boraalans?

595
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,834
LA FORGE:
A few more hours, Captain, but
we've got some problems here.

596
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:45,333
I don't think the Holodeck's
going to last that long.

597
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:48,041
We've had materialization errors
and resolution failures

598
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:49,250
all over the place.

599
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,667
And it's getting worse.

600
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:52,959
The simulation could
fall apart any minute.

601
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:54,875
We'll have the Transporter
Room standing by,

602
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,709
but we may have to
transport the Boraalans

603
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:57,959
whether you're
ready or not.

604
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,709
Please keep
Mr. Worf apprised.

605
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:02,333
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir.

606
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,667
You have the Bridge,
Number One.

607
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:08,125
We still have one more
problem to worry about.

608
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:13,250
(<i> door chimes</i> )

609
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

610
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,625
Yes.

611
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:30,083
We have arrived at the planet
that I told you about.

612
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,625
Have you made a decision?

613
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,583
I believe I would like
to go back to my people.

614
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:39,000
I see.

615
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,417
What do you intend
to tell them?

616
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,667
I don't know.

617
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,792
If you tell them the truth,
what will happen?

618
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,959
Will they believe you?

619
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:56,291
(<i> laughing</i> )

620
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,834
I'm not sure.

621
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:01,208
It is a fantastic story.

622
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:04,792
Perhaps they will think

623
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:07,542
that you have had
an hallucination

624
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:09,417
or that you're insane.

625
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:12,667
I don't think I would like
to live the rest of my life

626
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,667
knowing what I know

627
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,083
and being regarded
as a madman.

628
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,000
On the other hand,

629
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,208
they may believe
your fantastic story.

630
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:26,041
They will learn about...
alien worlds, starships.

631
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:28,583
That would be disastrous.

632
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:32,333
It would destroy
everything they believed in.

633
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:39,375
I can't tell them
the truth...

634
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,333
but I don't think I can
live with a secret.

635
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,875
Then stay here.

636
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:53,208
Make a future
for yourself with us.

637
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:01,041
I need some time.

638
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,834
Please.

639
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:19,875
How could you have
mated with a Boraalan?

640
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,166
What were you thinking?!

641
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,625
I don't owe you
an explanation.

642
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,542
This is a matter
between Dobara and myself.

643
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:27,375
As usual, you are only
thinking of yourself.

644
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,750
And as usual, you are here to
point out the error of my ways.

645
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,208
You have treated
Dobara with dishonor.
I have not!

646
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:36,417
I love her and we are going to
raise our child together.
That is not possible!

647
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:38,250
I cannot allow you
to remain here.

648
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,792
You will have
to kill me first!

649
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:42,417
(<i> loud crackling</i> )

650
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,291
What does it mean?
The storms have returned.

651
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,125
We'll all be killed.
No, you won't.

652
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:53,208
Worf has the power to end
the storms once and for all.

653
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,667
Yes, but everyone must
take shelter in the tents.

654
00:38:57,667 --> 00:39:00,875
The tents won't protect us.
Worf will protect you.
You must trust him.

655
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,208
Hurry, hurry.
Get to your tents now.

656
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,583
Commander, it might be helpful
if you could produce a storm--

657
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,542
wind, lightning
and thunder.

658
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:09,583
I'll see what I can do.

659
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,834
NIKOLAI:
Get in! Get in!

660
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,959
The storm
is getting worse!

661
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:25,792
Stay inside.

662
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:30,500
Worf and I will
take care of you.

663
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:39,000
Commander, energize.

664
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:02,583
The storms
will not return.

665
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,792
As I said he would,

666
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:08,917
my brother Worf
has saved us all.

667
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:21,125
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47427.2:</i>

668
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,500
<i>The Boraalans have safely</i>
<i>reached the site</i>

669
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,875
<i>of what will eventually</i>
<i>become their new village.</i>

670
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,750
<i>None of them suspects</i>
<i>they ever left their planet.</i>

671
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,583
<i>However, our success</i>
<i>has come at a high price.</i>

672
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:35,834
I think it was some form
of ritual suicide.

673
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:39,083
He said that he had
nowhere to go.

674
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:42,333
He would have died even if
we hadn't interfered.

675
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:44,458
But he wouldn't have
died alone...

676
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,458
and afraid.

677
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:50,875
Are you saying you're sorry
we saved the Boraalans?
No, of course not.

678
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:53,000
Our plan for them
worked out well.

679
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

680
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,959
But I wish that Vorin
could have bridged the gap

681
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:00,041
between our two cultures.

682
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:05,917
I would have liked the chance
to have known him better.

683
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,500
What?

684
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:25,959
Go inside.

685
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:28,458
Nikolai, don't.
Please.

686
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,792
I told you

687
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:49,000
you would have to kill me
to get me away from here.

688
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,542
I do not want to
fight you, Nikolai.

689
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,917
Things were never easy
between us, were they?

690
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:06,208
No.

691
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:12,000
It's my fault.

692
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,667
If I had been more like you,

693
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:18,208
we wouldn't have had
so many problems.

694
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:19,667
No.

695
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:22,542
If you had been
more like me,

696
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:25,500
these people would
not be here now.

697
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,583
You gave them
a chance at a new life.

698
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:34,875
And I intend to share
that life with them.

699
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:37,959
The village will need
a new chronicle.

700
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:40,250
Someone has to begin it.

701
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,375
My child will
need a father.

702
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:46,500
My place is here.

703
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,417
I'm finally taking
responsibility.

704
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:57,375
You were never
good at drawing.

705
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,500
How will you
keep a chronicle?

706
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,834
I learn quickly.

707
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:04,458
Then perhaps
there is hope.

708
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:29,417
Could I take
this with me?

709
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:31,959
Hmm... it's yours.

710
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:40,667
I will have to
explain all of this

711
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:42,166
to mother and father.

712
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,625
They won't understand.

713
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,709
They may.

714
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:48,125
I will tell them...

715
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,125
that you are happy.
