<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42494.8.</i>

2
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:09,166
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is bound</i>
<i>for Star Station India</i>

3
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:11,834
<i>to rendezvous with</i>
<i>a Starfleet medical courier.</i>

4
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:15,500
<i>We've been told only that</i>
<i>our presence is imperative.</i>

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,750
<i>Hopefully, the mission will</i>
<i>give me further opportunities</i>

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,458
<i>to assess the performance of</i>
<i>our new Chief Medical Officer.</i>

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,750
(<i> door chime</i> )

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,166
Come.

9
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,333
You wanted to see me, Captain?

10
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,500
Yes, Counselor.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,166
Come.

12
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,500
Sit down.

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,917
Counselor,

14
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:42,041
you've had the opportunity

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,458
to observe Dr. Pulaski
for some time now.

16
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:50,083
How would you evaluate her
as a Chief Medical Officer?

17
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,500
I've never met

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,792
a more dedicated physician.

19
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:57,834
I would say she has
a passion for her work.

20
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,458
Mm, yes, of course.

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,166
I entirely agree.

22
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,417
Is it possible
that such consuming dedication

23
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:09,709
could interfere
with her judgment?

24
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:13,834
I feel your concern, Captain,
but I don't share it.

25
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:17,208
Perhaps because I've
had the opportunity

26
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:21,041
to spend more time
with her and get
to know her better.

27
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,792
Yes, perhaps you're right.

28
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:27,166
DATA:
Captain, we are picking up
a faint distress signal

29
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,083
on an open subspace frequency.

30
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:32,291
It appears to be coming
from an adjacent sector.

31
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,917
Respond on the same frequency.

32
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,583
Have you locked on
to that transmission?

33
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,083
Aye, sir.

34
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,250
A voice-only transmission
from the USS<i> Lantree</i>

35
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,959
a Federation
supply ship.

36
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,917
USS<i> Lantree,</i> this is Picard
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

37
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:54,583
What is the nature
of your emergency?

38
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,000
MAN:
...can't hold out anymore.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,291
We are dying...

40
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,875
Too many to help...

41
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,417
We are still receiving
their signal, Captain,

42
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:04,208
but there is no message.

43
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,291
<i>Lantree...</i>

44
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:10,291
are you under attack?

45
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,750
(<i> static</i> )

46
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,792
<i>Lantree?</i>

47
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,959
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

48
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,166
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

49
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,041
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

50
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:51,041
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

51
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:55,583
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

52
00:02:55,583 --> 00:03:00,041
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

53
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:07,291
USS<i> Lantree,</i>
this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

54
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,291
Come in,<i> Lantree.</i>

55
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,834
Replay that last transmission.

56
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:19,333
...can't hold out anymore.

57
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,542
We are dying...

58
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:23,750
Too many to help...

59
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,458
Have we got
a fix on her?

60
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:31,333
2.2 milliparsecs, bearing 3-0
at 145 degrees, sir.

61
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,458
Number One?

62
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,709
We better take a look.

63
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,625
What kind of vessel is she?

64
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,750
The<i> Lantree</i> is a class 6
Federation supply ship

65
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,458
assigned to the Gamma 7 Sector.

66
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,750
Captain L.I. Telaka, commanding.

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,375
Normal complement,
26 officers and crew.

68
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,917
Armed?

69
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:48,542
Class 3, defensive only.

70
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:50,166
Is she still underway?

71
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,375
Aye, sir.

72
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,208
Adjust course to intercept.

73
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,333
Warp 7.

74
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,375
Adjusting course
to intercept.

75
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,625
Warp 7, sir.

76
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,709
Engineering, transfer to Bridge.

77
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,959
We are closing
on the<i> Lantree,</i> Captain.

78
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,583
Take us out of warp.

79
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,750
Establish parallel course
and match speed.

80
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,583
Yes, sir.

81
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,458
Hailing frequencies.

82
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,250
Open.

83
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,250
<i>Lantree,</i> this is
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

84
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:39,125
Captain Telaka, this is
Picard of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

85
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,583
Do you read me?

86
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,291
No life signs, Captain.

87
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,458
Counselor?

88
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,250
Nothing, Captain.

89
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,417
RIKER:
What else have we got
in the neighborhood?

90
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:55,125
WESLEY:
No other vessels of any kind
within two parsecs.

91
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,667
No battle damage.

92
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:59,125
All systems seem functional,
Captain.

93
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,959
Everything is in
perfect order.

94
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,417
We have to board her, Captain.

95
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,417
Possibly, Mr. Worf.

96
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:07,959
Number One?

97
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,458
If we gain control
of her systems remotely,

98
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,458
we could activate
the viewscreen.

99
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,375
That way, at least we could
look at the Bridge.

100
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,041
Agreed.

101
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,125
Computer,
security override request.

102
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,500
Identify.

103
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,625
Picard, Jean-Luc, Captain,
USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

104
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:34,792
Request control access
Starfleet ship USS<i> Lantree.</i>

105
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:36,625
Iso Telaka, commanding.

106
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,166
Enter access code.

107
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:41,667
Omicron omicron alpha yellow
daystar two seven.

108
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,917
Enable.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,417
DATA:
I have verified receipt

110
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,959
of the access codes
for the<i> Lantree,</i> Captain.

111
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,083
Grand.

112
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,542
Commence operations.

113
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,458
Our first move will be
to shut down the engines.

114
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,041
LA FORGE:
Standing by, Commander.

115
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,500
The<i> Lantree</i> computer

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,834
reports access codes
received and accepted, sir.

117
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,333
Sick Bay on alert, Captain.

118
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,000
The interlock is engaged.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,875
The<i> Lantree</i> is responding, sir.

120
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,792
We have override control
of her Bridge, Captain.

121
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,125
All systems answering.

122
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,208
All right.

123
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,041
Let's have a look.

124
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,083
LA FORGE:
<i>Lantree</i> Bridge
monitor, engaging.

125
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:20,250
You reading
anything, Doctor?

126
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,208
Still no signs of life, Captain.

127
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,875
Magnify.

128
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,375
That must be Captain Telaka
on the left.

129
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,917
Let's look at him.

130
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,709
Closer.

131
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,083
My God.

132
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,125
Looks like they had
a battle with time.

133
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,583
And lost.

134
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,667
Heart, lungs, liver...

135
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,667
everything.

136
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,208
What is it?

137
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,291
They died of natural causes.

138
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,291
Natural causes?

139
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,417
What in nature could cause that?

140
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,917
PULASKI:
For the record, Captain

141
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,625
they died of old age.

142
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,625
We've downloaded
the<i> Lantree's</i> logs, sir.

143
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,291
Play back the Captain's
last entry.

144
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,083
Captain's Log, Stardate 42493.1.

145
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,208
There are only six of us left.

146
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,166
We've set course for
the nearest Federation outpost,

147
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,291
but I am afraid it's too late.

148
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:53,041
All attempts to analyze
what is happening have failed.

149
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,583
In the last few hours,

150
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,125
I've watched friends
grow old and die.

151
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,792
And I'm seeing it happen to me.

152
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:03,166
Captain L.I. Telaka,
USS<i> Lantree.</i>

153
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,083
Captain Telaka was my age, sir.

154
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,000
Doctor?

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,834
Every member of the<i> Lantree</i> crew
had a complete examination

156
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,250
at the beginning of his
duty cycle, eight weeks ago.

157
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,250
They were in perfect health.

158
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,583
Nothing else since?

159
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:28,542
A single medical entry
noting that the First Officer

160
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:31,625
was treated for Thelusian flu
five days ago.

161
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,333
Thelusian flu?

162
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,750
It's an exotic,
but harmless rhinal virus.

163
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,125
It couldn't have caused this.

164
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,750
The last port of call
for the<i> Lantree</i>

165
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,792
was the Darwin
Genetic Research Station

166
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,750
on Gagarin IV, three days ago.

167
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,625
Whatever happened,
it could be something

168
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,500
that the<i> Lantree</i> crew
already had

169
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,458
or it could have
come from Gagarin.

170
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,208
At the very least

171
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,500
the people from
Darwin Station
deserve a warning.

172
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,917
We may have to consider
a quarantine.

173
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,250
You'll agree that we should
quarantine the<i> Lantree?</i>

174
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,834
Absolutely.

175
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:06,291
Lieutenant, initiate
the quarantine transmitters

176
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,917
on the<i> Lantree,</i> and activate her
marker beacons.

177
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,000
We'll need to
find her again.

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,291
Aye, sir.

179
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:27,083
Quarantine warnings active
on all frequencies, Captain.

180
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,875
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Extreme caution.

181
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,458
The USS<i> Lantree</i>
is a quarantined vessel

182
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,417
by order of Starfleet Command.

183
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,750
Do not board.

184
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,125
Set course
for Gagarin IV.

185
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,291
Warp 7.

186
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,208
Course and speed set, sir.

187
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,417
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Extreme caution...

188
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:42,458
Engage.

189
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,625
...is a quarantined vessel...

190
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:54,959
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

191
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,125
<i>We're en route to the</i>
<i>Federation Research Station</i>

192
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,208
<i>on Gagarin IV.</i>

193
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,333
<i>The mere thought</i>
<i>of a possible connection</i>

194
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,250
<i>between the</i> Lantree<i> tragedy</i>
<i>and a genetic research facility</i>

195
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,500
<i>fills me</i>
<i>with profound apprehension.</i>

196
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:12,417
We're approaching
Gagarin IV, Captain.

197
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,041
Standard orbit, Mr. Crusher.

198
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,208
Aye, sir.

199
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,375
Hailing frequencies.

200
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,542
Open.

201
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,125
Darwin Station,

202
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:23,000
this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,250
<i>Enterprise,</i>
this is Darwin Station.

204
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,792
I'm Dr. Kingsley.

205
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:29,542
We've just declared
a medical emergency here.

206
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:30,959
We need your help.

207
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,625
Uh, Dr. Kingsley,

208
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,792
what is the nature
of your emergency?

209
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,875
To whom am I speaking, please?

210
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,750
I'm Dr. Pulaski,
Chief Medical Officer.

211
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,417
Katherine Pulaski?

212
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:45,166
Author of<i> Linear Models</i>
<i>of Viral Propagation?</i>

213
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,917
That was a long time ago.

214
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,458
But still the standard.

215
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,625
I can't think of anyone
I'd rather be dealing with.

216
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:54,834
Doctor, we're experiencing
the rapid onset

217
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,583
of geriatric phenomena.

218
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:00,333
The first symptom is sudden,
acute arthritic inflammation.

219
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,417
Then the aging process
accelerates.

220
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:04,917
The<i> Lantree.</i>

221
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,291
Dr. Pulaski,

222
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,792
I celebrated my 35th
birthday a week ago.

223
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:14,041
Doctor, we understand
that Darwin Station

224
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,792
is involved in genetic research.

225
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:17,667
Is there a possible connection?

226
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,333
Our research here is
limited to human genetics.

227
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,083
I can assure you
we're not dealing

228
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,959
with something
that got away from us.

229
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,291
We believe that we were infected
by a supply ship

230
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,917
that was here three days ago.

231
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:29,834
Doctor, if you're speaking
of the<i> Lantree,</i>

232
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,959
we encountered it
a few hours ago.

233
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,250
All the crew members were dead.

234
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,667
Which would seem
to confirm our suspicion.

235
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:40,875
Were you able to establish
a pathology, Doctor?

236
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,542
Doctor, did you hear
what I said?

237
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:45,917
All the 26 men and women
aboard that ship were dead.

238
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:48,792
I heard you, Captain,
and the prognosis is alarming,

239
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:51,250
but my immediate concern
is our children.

240
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,834
Children?

241
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:55,250
They represent years
of advanced genetic research.

242
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,667
You must evacuate them
as soon as possible.

243
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,917
I'm sorry,
but under the circumstances

244
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:01,542
until we know what's going on,

245
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:03,917
I'm imposing a full quarantine
on Darwin Station.

246
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,625
But the children have been
in protective isolation

247
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,375
since this was detected.

248
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,792
They've shown no symptoms.

249
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:11,750
You cannot leave them
here to die.

250
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,083
Doctor, our options
in a quarantine situation

251
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,667
are extremely limited.

252
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:18,709
We are going to consider
the possibilities.

253
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:21,083
I suggest you do the same.

254
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,667
I recommend against
contact, Captain.

255
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,041
Number One?

256
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,583
I have to agree, sir.

257
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,959
I wish there was something
we could do,

258
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,333
but I think the risk
is too great.

259
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,500
Doctor?

260
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,375
If the children are
free of disease

261
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,500
as Dr. Kingsley said,

262
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,208
they should be evacuated.

263
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,000
I would like to bring
one of them aboard

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,500
within a forcefield,
for a complete examination.

265
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,709
Counselor?

266
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,417
Do you sense
anything?

267
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:48,667
Dr. Kingsley sincerely believes
the children are not a threat,

268
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:51,750
but she's not telling us
the whole truth.

269
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,166
I recommend caution.

270
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,792
We have only
Dr. Kingsley's assurance

271
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,875
that these children
are not infected

272
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,208
whereas, we have seen

273
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,250
the results of this disease
firsthand.

274
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,542
In a case like this,
I think we should err

275
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,709
on the side of caution.

276
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,291
All right.

277
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,583
We could beam up one child
encased in styrolite

278
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,125
in suspended animation.

279
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,792
That way, I could scan
for possible infection

280
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,166
without danger to ourselves
or to the child.

281
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,917
But we don't know
what we're looking for.

282
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:25,417
Exactly.

283
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:29,041
And we won't
until we start gathering data.

284
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,917
Captain, that's
worth some risk.

285
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:32,625
There's always risk, Doctor.

286
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

287
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,250
Proceed with the examination.

288
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,458
But I shall require
positive proof

289
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,834
that these children are harmless
before I place any of my crew

290
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,458
in jeopardy.

291
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,583
Forcefield is ready, Captain.

292
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,750
Activate.

293
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,041
Transporter?

294
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,458
This is Chief O'Brien, sir.

295
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,750
Almost ready.

296
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,542
Is there a problem?

297
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:08,792
It's the styrolite.

298
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,291
I'm altering the delta-t

299
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,333
so the styrolite coating
materializes

300
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,500
two microseconds
ahead of the child.

301
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,166
It has to be right
the first time.

302
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,709
Well, take all
the time you need.

303
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,417
Entering corrections now, sir.

304
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,166
Ready, Captain.

305
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,375
Dr. Kingsley, are you
ready to transport?

306
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,667
KINGSLEY:
You have the coordinates.

307
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:35,125
We have one 12-year-old male
encased in number six styrolite.

308
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,291
Transporter...

309
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,792
energize.

310
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,917
A trick!

311
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:46,166
Transporter reverse...

312
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,333
One moment, Lieutenant.

313
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,792
Whoever he is,
he's still in stasis.

314
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,875
Styrolite is intact, Captain.

315
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,834
Forcefield down.

316
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,750
Captain,

317
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,583
there's a definite
presence.

318
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,709
A distinct
personality.

319
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:21,959
Even in stasis,
it's quite strong.

320
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,583
The child is
unquestionably
telepathic.

321
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,250
PULASKI:
A child
this mature?

322
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,041
We could be looking
at the future of humanity.

323
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,375
Hmm.

324
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:37,583
At least Dr. Kingsley's
vision of it.

325
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,792
This child is in better
health than we are.

326
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,625
His immune system
is so advanced,

327
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,000
it may not be possible
for him to contract disease.

328
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I want to free him
from the styrolite.

329
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,792
That seems rather
risky, Doctor.

330
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:23,333
I can do no further tests
until he's animate.

331
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,375
But what if you're wrong?

332
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,709
You saw what happened
on the<i> Lantree.</i>

333
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:28,959
I know I'm right.

334
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,917
I can't expose
the<i> Enterprise</i>

335
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,792
until I know
where this disease came from

336
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,000
and how it is transmitted.

337
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,542
I realize that, Captain.

338
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,333
Naturally, we'll establish
a forcefield containment.

339
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,333
But if we lose the forcefield
for any reason,

340
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,583
we lose the ship.

341
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,125
Forcefields can fail,
and until...

342
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,333
We don't have that kind of time.

343
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,750
These children can't survive
in the lab

344
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,417
once their parents are dead.

345
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:51,917
Look at him,
Captain.

346
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,166
He's a human being
who needs our help.

347
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,375
But the risk is...

348
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,792
Minimal.

349
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,792
If you can
demonstrate

350
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,750
that he is biologically harmless

351
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,875
without risk to the crew,

352
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,333
I'll do everything in my power
to assist.

353
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,333
And, Doctor, God knows
I'm not one to discourage input,

354
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,875
but I would appreciate it

355
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,333
if you'd let me finish
my sentences

356
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,667
once in awhile.

357
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:35,792
Deanna.

358
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:36,917
Do you have a minute?

359
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,250
Mm-hmm.

360
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,291
You've known
the Captain
for some time.

361
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,709
I think I need
some advice.

362
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:43,792
I don't seem to
be dealing with
him very well.

363
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:45,333
Why do you say that?

364
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,625
Well, my arguments
don't seem to have
any effect on him.

365
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:51,083
We just end up quoting
regulations to each other.

366
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,250
He has such a consuming
dedication to his ship.

367
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,000
He doesn't seem to
be able to step back

368
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,375
to see the human side
of the equation.

369
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,959
What's the matter?

370
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,792
Kate, I don't think
he'd be where he is

371
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:06,792
if he couldn't see
the human side of the equation.

372
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:10,083
Perhaps the two of you
aren't all that different.

373
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,417
What do you mean?

374
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,458
Let's just say,
you both have

375
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:18,125
well-established
personalities.

376
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,417
Dr. Kingsley,
this is Kate Pulaski.

377
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:37,875
Doctor, do you have a decision?

378
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,667
I'm afraid it's bad news.

379
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,750
How can that be?

380
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,417
The risk to the ship and crew
is too great.

381
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,333
Until we absolutely know
the cause of the disease

382
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,709
the children...

383
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:48,959
The children are harmless.

384
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:52,333
Every test on them
has been negative.

385
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:56,083
I demand that you do something
to save them.

386
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,417
Please, Doctor.

387
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:03,917
For God's sake,
we haven't got much time.

388
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:06,417
Stand by.
I'll get back to you.

389
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,250
Geordi, I need your help.

390
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,625
What is it, Doctor?

391
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,417
I need to prove that
the children are harmless.

392
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,792
I can only do that
in a fail-safe environment.

393
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:21,208
The problem is,
there's no area of the ship

394
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,291
that can be sealed off
with absolute certainty.

395
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,834
Even with forcefields...

396
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:26,959
Sick Bay has
an isolated system.

397
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,000
But it's not possible
to totally cut it off

398
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,625
from the rest of the ship.

399
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,625
The only truly
independent environment

400
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,208
would be
something like...

401
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,875
like a shuttlecraft.

402
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,208
A shuttlecraft.

403
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,208
Why didn't you say so?

404
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,041
(<i> door chime</i> )

405
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,792
Come.

406
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:53,083
Captain, I'd like permission to
put the boy in a shuttlecraft.

407
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,125
I can study him there
without risk to anyone else.

408
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,333
What about you?

409
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,834
I'm prepared to take that risk.

410
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:02,000
Someone has to breathe
the same air he breathes.

411
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,333
To touch him.

412
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:07,166
I'm volunteering to make
that test myself.

413
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,083
Doctor, you have
a responsibility

414
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,333
to this ship, which goes...

415
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:14,000
I also have a responsibility
to humanity.

416
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,333
Starfleet guidelines

417
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,750
about contact with
quarantined vess...

418
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,959
You don't have to quote
the rule book.

419
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,166
You were saying?

420
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,542
Request approved.

421
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,834
Captain, you said if I...

422
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:32,625
Approved?

423
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:37,208
I recognize that you're trying
to satisfy my conditions.

424
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,959
Thank you.

425
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,917
You sent for me, Doctor?

426
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,291
I did, Commander.

427
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,917
I assume that
you're qualified

428
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:57,917
to pilot this
shuttlecraft?

429
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,291
DATA:
Certainly.

430
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,667
I took advanced training
in the operation

431
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,333
of auxiliary space vessels
at Starfleet academy

432
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,583
where I received...

433
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,208
A more than passing
grade, no doubt.

434
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,291
Please, come aboard.

435
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,875
We don't have
much time.

436
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,750
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

437
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:14,375
COMPUTER:
Shuttle Bay Three
forcefield activated.

438
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:34,375
You are certain the Captain
approved this, Doctor?

439
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,542
You'll take us
a few hundred meters

440
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:39,583
away from the<i> Enterprise</i>
and hold position.

441
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:42,375
Begin shuttlecraft
launch sequence.

442
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,792
Good luck, Doctor.

443
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,208
We are in position,
Doctor.

444
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:23,041
It's the only way to prove
they're harmless.

445
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,291
And if they are not?

446
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:28,792
I hate to keep reminding you,
but you are a machine.

447
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:31,417
You'll be perfectly safe.

448
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,583
That is by no means certain,
Doctor,

449
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,959
but I was referring to you.

450
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:42,333
Medical research is sometimes
a risky business.

451
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,959
It's all part of being human.

452
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:47,583
Shall we proceed?

453
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,333
Ready to transport.

454
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,125
DATA:
You have the coordinates,
Chief O'Brien.

455
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:55,917
Shuttlecraft, maintain
your position and stand by.

456
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,500
Standing by.

457
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,834
Transporter Control,
what's our status?

458
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,667
We have a green panel, sir.

459
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:13,291
Stand by to transport.

460
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,625
Aye, sir.

461
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:15,917
Energize.

462
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,917
Oh, yes.

463
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:56,125
I do.

464
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,834
I understand you perfectly.

465
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,291
How could you, Doctor?

466
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,375
He has not said anything.

467
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh, yes, he has.

468
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,667
Troi is right.

469
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:08,875
He's telepathic.

470
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:29,458
Time?

471
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:33,959
COMPUTER:
0322, exactly.

472
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:38,959
She's been in direct contact
with the boy for 18 minutes.

473
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,709
All systems are functioning

474
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,917
within normal specifications,
Doctor.

475
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:51,000
The manufacturer will
be pleased to hear it.

476
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,750
I appreciate your help,

477
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,291
but your bedside
manner needs work.

478
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:56,583
Bedside manner?

479
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:57,959
(<i> gasping</i> )

480
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:01,709
Doctor?

481
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:18,000
PICARD:
Doctor, I don't understand.

482
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,625
What has happened?

483
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,375
There was no warning.

484
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:24,041
Explain.

485
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,500
Arthritic inflammation.

486
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,375
It's the initial symptom
of the disease.

487
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,250
What can we do?

488
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,458
Return the boy
to Darwin Station.

489
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:35,709
Apparently,
the children are carriers.

490
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,959
PICARD:
Chief O'Brien, are you ready?

491
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:47,041
I have the original coordinates

492
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,542
of the Darwin isolation lab,
Captain.

493
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:50,750
Quickly, please.

494
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,125
Shuttle one, hold your position.

495
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:56,125
Holding.

496
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:01,208
O'BRIEN:
Stand by to transport.

497
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,709
It wasn't your fault.

498
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:15,417
PICARD:
Tell us what you need, Doctor.

499
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:18,291
There's nothing you can do,
Captain.

500
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:21,583
I'm not going to make myself
an exception

501
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,375
to the Darwin quarantine.

502
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,667
Shuttle One, out.

503
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:29,000
What is your
condition, Doctor?

504
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,083
Not exactly
up to factory specs.

505
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,458
I'm sorry.

506
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,458
The pain is tolerable.

507
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:36,625
Thank you.

508
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:39,333
Shall I set course
for Darwin Station?

509
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:42,041
We're already
under quarantine.

510
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,333
What do we have to lose?

511
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,166
We can no longer consider
the Darwin Station crisis

512
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,583
our most immediate concern.

513
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,500
Although Dr. Pulaski's condition

514
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,875
is inseparably linked
with that emergency,

515
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:01,041
her safe return
and that of Commander Data

516
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,041
must take priority, please.

517
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:06,041
Shouldn't Dr. Pulaski
be involved in this?

518
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:07,875
From what we've seen
on the<i> Lantree,</i>

519
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:10,041
Dr. Pulaski may not have time
to help herself.

520
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:11,500
Well, I suggest

521
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,792
we beam them both
back onto the ship.

522
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,875
Commander Data is
most likely immune

523
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,458
and surely the bio-filter...

524
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:20,041
Oh, the transporter's
bio-filter won't protect us.

525
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,959
The boy was transported
twice already

526
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,750
and still infected
Dr. Pulaski.

527
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,250
Yeah, but couldn't we adjust
the bio-filter?

528
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,458
We can alter the filter
to screen out

529
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,959
whatever it is
that's causing the disease.

530
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,542
But we don't know what's causing
the disease.

531
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:35,041
We can't protect ourselves
against the unknown.

532
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,792
What we need is
some kind of filter

533
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:40,625
that doesn't depend
on known biological factors.

534
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:44,000
We might try the trace.

535
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,208
The transporter trace?

536
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,500
Well, as you know,
the transporter

537
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,875
keeps a record
of all transmissions--

538
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,375
a pattern, if you will.

539
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,417
Usually, it's just stored
for security purposes,

540
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:55,250
but if we use
the transporter trace

541
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,125
to control
the reconstitution process...

542
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:01,375
I don't think it's ever been
tried quite that way before,

543
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,834
but, theoretically,
it is possible.

544
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:08,000
I'd have to make
extensive modifications.

545
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,291
Then do it.

546
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,834
Seems we have no alternative.

547
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,792
Where will we get
the trace pattern?

548
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,792
The Doctor's never used
our transporter.

549
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:16,417
Never?

550
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:18,917
No, she's a woman of very
strongly held opinions, sir.

551
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:21,291
What was her
previous assignment?

552
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,917
Her last ship
was the<i> Repulse.</i>

553
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:25,583
Bridge, Picard.

554
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:28,709
Contact the USS<i> Repulse</i>

555
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:32,333
using subspace
Captain's priority channel.

556
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,959
Oh, Dr. Pulaski...

557
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:50,959
I can only tell you
how much I regret

558
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:53,792
the burden
we've imposed on you.

559
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,375
On both of you.

560
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:57,625
Commander Data
is an android.

561
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:58,792
He's unaffected.

562
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,458
As for me,
I chose this.

563
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:03,792
I was convinced
the children were safe.

564
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:07,333
I still can't believe you were
infected by one of our children.

565
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,750
The evidence is
fairly conclusive.

566
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,125
You don't understand.

567
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,166
They were designed
to resist disease.

568
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:16,709
I think it's time
we talked about that.

569
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:18,875
Let me show you something.

570
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,875
Our ultimate achievement.

571
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:41,709
The oldest is 12
and all are telekinetic.

572
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:43,250
Watch.

573
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:51,291
Genetically engineered?

574
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,291
Not engineered, created.

575
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,875
Perfect in every way--

576
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:59,375
their body structure,
their musculature, their minds.

577
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,083
You were telling me

578
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:03,166
about their
immune system.

579
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,792
That was our masterpiece.

580
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:07,250
We gave these children
an aggressive immunity.

581
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,458
The rest of us were infected
by the supply ship,

582
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,166
but they were protected.

583
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,041
The<i> Lantree</i> logs indicated
that only one crewman

584
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,375
had any illness
prior to arrival here.

585
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,375
The First Officer had
a mild case of Thelusian flu.

586
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,750
Yes, he was one of the crewmen
who came

587
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,500
in direct contact with us.

588
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,583
The Thelusian flu would have
little effect on you,

589
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:30,417
but, tell me,
how would they react?

590
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:33,542
Their immune system would
release an active antibody

591
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:35,250
that would attack the virus.

592
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,083
Even at a distance?

593
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,625
Their immune systems don't wait

594
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,250
for a disease
to attack the body.

595
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,041
It would seek out an airborne
virus and destroy it.

596
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:44,250
Destroy it?

597
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,750
How exactly?

598
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,750
The antibody would adapt itself

599
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,458
to alter the genetic code
of the virus.

600
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:55,375
Commander, I want
an analysis of
the interaction

601
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:59,125
between the Thelusian
flu and the children.

602
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,250
On a molecular
genetic level?

603
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,000
We don't have
time for that.

604
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,625
Genetic analysis
could take months.

605
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,208
Not necessarily.

606
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:11,333
Commander Data has
a way with computers.

607
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,750
Sorry, Picard.

608
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,166
We erased Dr. Pulaski's
transporter pattern

609
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,542
right after she transferred.

610
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:19,125
Not that she used
the transporter much.

611
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,917
She preferred the shuttlecraft.

612
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:24,166
I would have given her a shuttle
if it would have kept her here.

613
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:28,041
Tell me, Taggert, if she served
you as well as you say,

614
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,709
why did you let her go?

615
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:33,750
I see you haven't run
into her stubborn streak yet.

616
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,709
As soon as she found out about
an opening on the<i> Enterprise,</i>

617
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:39,750
she put in a request
for transfer.

618
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,250
Knew your service record
backward and forward.

619
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,917
Apparently, she's been an
admirer of yours for some time.

620
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:49,333
Extraordinary.

621
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,333
Commander...

622
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,291
what have you got?

623
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:56,083
The answer,
I believe, Doctor.

624
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:59,333
The<i> Lantree</i> was not
the source of the disease,

625
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,000
but it was the trigger.

626
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,583
Trigger?

627
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:05,291
The<i> Lantree's</i> First Officer
exposed your children

628
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,750
to Thelusian flu
for the first time.

629
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,709
Their active immune systems
set out to attack the virus

630
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:14,041
and once it was triggered,
it kept going.

631
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:17,500
But the antibody created
an unexpected side effect.

632
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:22,125
It alters the genetic makeup
of normal humans.

633
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,667
This is a comparison

634
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,792
of the altered and normal DNA.

635
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,667
These are the two molecules
that have been transposed.

636
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:31,709
And since our DNA
is self-replicating,

637
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,417
the process...

638
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:36,000
Is irreversible.

639
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,333
Judging from what happened
on the<i> Lantree,</i>

640
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:45,375
anyone is a carrier
once they're infected.

641
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:51,458
Oh.

642
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:59,333
Have you made
any progress, Doctor?

643
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,125
I'm afraid so, Captain.

644
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:03,208
The children don't
carry the disease.

645
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,333
They are the cause.

646
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,000
What do you mean?

647
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,250
Their advanced immune system
has created an antibody

648
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,959
that changes normal DNA.

649
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:14,458
The altered genes are the ones
that control aging.

650
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:17,750
Then why did it attack
you more quickly
than Dr. Kingsley?

651
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,500
The enclosed environment
of the shuttlecraft

652
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,667
concentrated my exposure.

653
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,542
The<i> Lantree's</i> First Officer

654
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:26,792
carried the antibody
onto his ship.

655
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:29,417
It had the same effect
on his crew.

656
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,041
Right, what's the next step?

657
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:33,125
The children will survive,

658
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:37,166
but the rest of us
are just about out of time.

659
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,291
Doctor, I want you
back aboard this ship.

660
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:50,000
We'll beam you up in
suspended animation
like the boy.

661
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,709
That will give us more time.

662
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:53,667
Captain, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

663
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:55,375
but I got into this
by leaping before I looked

664
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,959
and I won't allow you
to make the same mistake.

665
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:05,583
Chief Medical Officer's log.

666
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:08,875
This will be my final report
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

667
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,792
Just as changes in evolution

668
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:14,709
are known to be caused
by changes in the environment,

669
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:18,500
we now know the process
also works in reverse.

670
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,792
An attempt
to control human evolution

671
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:24,875
has resulted in a new species

672
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,166
that's lethal
to its predecessors.

673
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,500
The children will be condemned

674
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,208
to live out their lives
in isolation.

675
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:34,875
The quarantine
of the Darwin Station

676
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,250
must be maintained<i> forever.</i>

677
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:50,583
I am sorry I could
not be more helpful, Doctor.

678
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:53,917
You did everything
you could, Commander.

679
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:58,667
As androids go, you're
in a class by yourself.

680
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,208
Doctor...

681
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,875
Please.

682
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:05,834
Give my best to the Captain.

683
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:14,625
<i>Enterprise,</i> Commander Data
ready to beam aboard.

684
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:26,500
Captain,

685
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,208
Kate knew what she was doing.

686
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:32,750
I wish I could be certain
that we'd tried everything.

687
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:36,041
Commander Data is ready
to come aboard, sir.

688
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:43,125
You have the Bridge, Number One.

689
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:59,333
No life-forms present, sir.

690
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:04,834
You may
step down, sir.

691
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:10,166
Data, tell me, if...

692
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,375
It's good to see you again.

693
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:13,166
Thank you, sir.

694
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:15,667
Now, quickly-- if the changes in
Dr. Pulaski's DNA were reversed,

695
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,875
would it be possible...

696
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,000
It is not reversible, sir.

697
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,375
The subtle molecular
transposition...

698
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,875
Yes, yes, yes,
but say if it were "undone,"

699
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,750
would she be normal again?

700
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,375
As normal as ever, sir.

701
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,917
You said that the transporter
could be modified

702
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:31,875
to filter out the changes
in Dr. Pulaski.

703
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,083
Yes, sir, but we were unable
to locate her trace pattern.

704
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,458
Well...

705
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:39,667
what if we used
a sample of her DNA--

706
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:42,125
say, um, from a blood test--

707
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:45,208
taken before she was exposed
to the disease--

708
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:48,166
could that be used to filter out
the genetic changes?

709
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,291
Well, I'd have to get
into the bio-filter bus

710
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,792
and patch in a molecular
matrix reader.

711
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:54,208
That's no problem.

712
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:55,959
But the waveform modulator
will be overloaded

713
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,834
without the regeneration
limiter

714
00:37:57,834 --> 00:37:59,083
in the first stage circuit.

715
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:00,583
Hmm, interesting.

716
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:01,834
However,
theoretically...

717
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:03,041
Data.
Yes, sir.

718
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,417
Can you do the modifications?

719
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,625
I think so, sir.

720
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,625
Then make it so.

721
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:09,000
You heard what he said.

722
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,458
Let's get those panels off.

723
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:18,083
A blood test, a tissue sample--

724
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,333
anything that would have

725
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,709
a sample of Dr. Pulaski's
original DNA.

726
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:23,291
No, sir, her records
were shipped

727
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,959
by way of Starfleet
Headquarters.

728
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:26,625
They have not
caught up with us yet.

729
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:27,834
This is ridiculous.

730
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:30,250
A cell, a single cell...

731
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,000
Let's check her quarters.

732
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:48,667
Anything--
a fingernail, a hair...

733
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:49,917
Hairbrush.

734
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,875
It has a follicle, sir.

735
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,166
Live cells.

736
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:12,709
Darwin Station,
this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

737
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:14,375
PULASKI:
Go ahead, Captain.

738
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,750
I'm here.

739
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,792
PICARD:
Doctor, we may have a solution.

740
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:27,375
We have a sample
of your normal DNA

741
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:30,667
to use as a filter
in the transporter.

742
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:33,709
We think
that we can beam you aboard

743
00:39:33,709 --> 00:39:35,875
while filtering out

744
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:39,208
any of the genetic problems
caused by the disease.

745
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:41,709
Interesting theory, Captain.

746
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:46,000
If it works, we could use
the same technique

747
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,875
to save Dr. Kingsley
and her colleagues.

748
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:55,667
I think you should know this
has never been attempted before.

749
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,291
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

750
00:39:57,291 --> 00:40:00,041
If I live through this...

751
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:06,458
I'll have a much better
understanding of geriatrics.

752
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,375
All set, Chief?

753
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,583
Almost ready, sir.

754
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:15,667
There's just one thing.
Yes?

755
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,875
This modification's
one way only.

756
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,333
If it doesn't work,

757
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,125
we won't be able
to reverse-transport

758
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,542
the Doctor back
to the planet.

759
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:30,667
Then, I'll operate the
transporter controls myself.

760
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:36,000
If she's going to be consigned
to oblivion, then...

761
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,542
Thank you, sir.

762
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:40,500
I'll be monitoring
the medical scans,

763
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,959
but you'll be able
to tell if it's worked

764
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,917
by watching the stack.

765
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:47,917
Dr. Pulaski, are you ready?

766
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:51,250
I suppose I am, Captain.

767
00:40:57,917 --> 00:41:00,125
Here we go.

768
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:13,375
PICARD:
It's not working.

769
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:15,166
O'BRIEN:
Captain, wait.

770
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,834
(<i> beeping</i> )

771
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,583
Doctor.

772
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:50,333
Good to see you, Doctor.

773
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:53,000
Welcome back, Doctor.

774
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,333
Come.

775
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,125
Captain, if this
hadn't worked...

776
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:03,250
if...

777
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,542
If this hadn't worked,

778
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:06,917
it would have
been necessary

779
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:09,750
to beam your energy
into empty space.

780
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:13,000
And spread my atoms
across the galaxy.

781
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,417
Yes, I'm sorry...

782
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:15,792
No, no, don't be sorry.

783
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:18,083
Every time I get
into the damned thing,

784
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:21,792
I'm convinced that's
what's going to happen.

785
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:29,208
<i>Chief Medical Officer's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

786
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:31,083
<i>The adults of Darwin station</i>

787
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:32,959
<i>have been restored</i>
<i>to normal health</i>

788
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:34,166

789
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:36,041
<i>They will remain on Gagarin IV</i>

790
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:39,500
<i>and continue their research</i>
<i>in hopes of one day</i>

791

<i>rejoining their children.</i>

792
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:44,125
Impulse speed.

793
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,709
There she is,
Captain.

794
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:49,917
<i>Scientists believe</i>
<i>no experiment is a failure,</i>

795
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:54,333
<i>that even a mistake advances</i>
<i>the evolution of understanding.</i>

796
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,250
Close to 40 kilometers.

797
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,166
40 kilometers.
Aye, sir.

798
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:01,166
<i>But all achievement</i>

799
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:03,000

<i>the men and women</i>

<i>Their sacrifice is thus noted</i>

804
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:18,667
Number One.

805
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:21,917
Lieutenant Worf,
arm the photon torpedoes.

806
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:26,500
Torpedoes ready, Commander.

807
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,583
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Extreme caution.

808
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:30,834
The USS<i> Lantree</i> is

809
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:32,834

810
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:34,208
Do not board.

811
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,542
Gentlemen.

812
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:38,166
Extreme caution.

813
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:41,291
The USS<i> Lantree</i> is

WESLEY:
Course and speed set, sir.

818
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:13,291
Engage.
