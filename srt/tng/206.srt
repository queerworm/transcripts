00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:06,834
PULASKI:
<i>Medical Log, Stardate 42437.5.</i>

2
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:09,125
<i>Ira Graves is arguably</i>

3
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,875
<i>the greatest human mind</i>
<i>in the universe.</i>

4
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:13,208
<i>For years, he's lived</i>
<i>in near isolation</i>

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,667
<i>on a remote planet, devoting</i>
<i>full time to his research.</i>

6
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:20,083
<i>Eight hours ago, we monitored</i>
<i>a message from his assistant</i>

7
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,917
<i>urgently requesting</i>
<i>medical aid.</i>

8
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:24,875
<i>I only hope</i>
<i>we can reach him in time.</i>

9
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:26,834
Any response from
Gravesworld, Mr. Worf?

10
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,125
Nothing, sir.

11
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,000
Not since
their initial communication.

12
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,208
They send out a plea for help

13
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,959
and then they
cut off transmission

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,166
so they can't tell
if there's any help on the way.

15
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,875
That doesn't make
much sense, does it?

16
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:39,959
Ensign, what's our
ETA at the planet?

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,709
36 minutes
to orbit, sir.

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,834
Starfleet Command considers
that Graves's work

19
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,375
on molecular cybernetics

20
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:48,500
is reaching
a critical stage.

21
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:51,625
They consider this
a Priority One action.

22
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:52,750
A man is ill, Captain.

23
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:54,667
Treating him is
<i>my</i> priority one

24
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:56,750
regardless of who he is.

25
00:00:56,792 --> 00:01:00,000
Did Data say why
he wants to see us?

26
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,166
He said something
about his new image.

27
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,875
I tell you, he's been acting
kind of strange lately.

28
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:06,083
How so?

29
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,834
Well, if I didn't
know better

30
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,917
I'd say he was showing
signs of insecurity.

31
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:10,959
(<i> laughing</i> )

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,208
Yes, but you<i> do</i> know better.

33
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,500
Androids don't feel
such things.

34
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:15,917
I don't know.

35
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,041
Sometimes, I think he's
becoming more human

36
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:21,166
than any of us realize.

37
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,583
(<i> door chimes</i> )

38
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,709
DATA:
Come in.

39
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,125
Data?

40
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,166
Geordi?

41
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,792
Is Counselor
Troi with you?

42
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:32,500
Yes, I'm here, Data.

43
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:34,208
Geordi said
you wanted to see us.

44
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,375
Indeed.

45
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:37,125
Or stated more
correctly

46
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:40,875
I wanted you
to see me.

47
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,500
Can we come in?

48
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:44,208
Please.

49
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,250
Did you damage
your face, Data?

50
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,458
It is a beard, Geordi.

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
A fine, full,
dignified beard.

52
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:04,625
One which commands respect

53
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:09,333
and projects thoughtfulness
and dignity.

54
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,333
Well? Opinions?

55
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,291
Uh...

56
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,917
It's, uh...

57
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,709
very different.

58
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,208
When I stroke
the beard thusly

59
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,709
do I not appear more...
intellectual?

60
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,709
(<i> stifled laugh</i> )

61
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,750
I'm sorry,
I have to go now.

62
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:30,709
Good-bye.

63
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,709
(<i> laughing</i> )

64
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,291
Why was she laughing?

65
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:41,375
We are receiving a transmission
from Gravesworld, sir.

66
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:42,458
It's unfocused--

67
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,917
not directed specifically at us.

68
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,083
On viewer,
Mr. Worf.

69
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,166
WOMAN:
If anyone can hear me

70
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,709
please send a doctor.

71
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,959
Things are getting worse.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,125
PICARD:
Try and raise her, Mr. Crusher.

73
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,667
Tell them
we're only minutes away.

74
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,291
It's no good, sir.

75
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,125
I don't believe
they're receiving us.

76
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,959
Our records show
that she and Graves

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,709
are the only ones living
on the planet, Captain.

78
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,917
Then what scared her?

79
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,083
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

80
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:41,667
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

81
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

82
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,291
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

83
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:51,333
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

84
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:56,083
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

85
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,208
Captain,
I am picking up another signal

86
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,250
but it is not from the planet.

87
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,583
On screen, Mr. Worf.

88
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,125
The signal is
very weak, sir.

89
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,375
Audio only.

90
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:06,333
Pipe it through.

91
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,125
MAN:
Mayday! Mayday!

92
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,250
(<i> static</i> ):
This is the USS...
requesting emergency...

93
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,542
The outer hull is breached

94
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,834
and environmental systems
compromised.

95
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,875
...immediate assistance.

96
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,792
WESLEY:
Captain, I show
the<i> Constantinople</i>

97
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:18,792
in that general vicinity.

98
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,542
She's a transport ship

99
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,959
used to ferry settlers.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,792
I'm showing 2,012
colonists aboard.

101
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:29,667
Outer hull breach-- she must
have had an internal explosion.

102
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,000
PULASKI:
If that's the case

103
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,959
they'll all be prone
to severe hypoxia.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,583
Their lives are at risk.

105
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,625
We've got
to help them.

106
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:39,041
And what about Graves?

107
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,792
He is one man.

108
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,792
Suggestion, Captain.

109
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,041
Why don't we execute

110
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,625
a long-range transport
of an away team

111
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,792
to assist Dr. Graves
at your earliest
possible moment.

112
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:54,500
We'll come out of warp just long
enough to energize the beam.

113
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:59,250
A touch-and-go downwarping.

114
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,041
Ensign Crusher,
prepare to make it so.

115
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,166
Aye, sir.

116
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,208
Engineering, Mr. La Forge.

117
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,333
We're going to execute
a near-warp transport.

118
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,625
This may be a little tricky.
I would like you to handle it.

119
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:10,709
Yes, Captain.

120
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,125
I'm on my way.

121
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,208
Assemble an away team,
Number One.

122
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,375
Include whoever

123
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,250
the Doctor requires
to assist her.

124
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,625
Excuse me, sir, but there may be
hundreds on the<i> Constantinople</i>

125
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,542
that require
emergency attention.

126
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,542
I should be there
to supervise.

127
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,375
All right, who will replace you?

128
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:26,667
Lieutenant Selar.

129
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:29,208
She has my complete
confidence.

130
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,291
Worf, let's go.

131
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,959
RIKER:
Phaser on stun, Mr. Worf.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,625
We don't know what's
going on down there.

133
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:43,917
There's no need
to take any chances.

134
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,875
Agreed, sir.

135
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:46,208
LA FORGE:
Now, remember

136
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,500
this is a near-warp transport,
so the effects

137
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:49,709
may be a little unusual.

138
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,834
What do you mean?

139
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,375
RIKER:
You'll see, Counselor.

140
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,458
Energize.

141
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,667
TROI:
Wait a minute.

142
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,291
I don't understand.

143
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,875
You do now.

144
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,291
This might sound crazy

145
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,250
but, for a moment, I thought
I was stuck in that wall.

146
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,375
For a moment, you were.

147
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:26,667
Data to<i> Enterprise.</i>

148
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:27,834
PICARD:
I read you, Commander.

149
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:28,917
Go ahead.

150
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,750
We are inside Graves's home.

151
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,000
All is quiet so far.

152
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,625
Of course, no one knew
we were coming.

153
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:38,208
Use caution, but protect
Graves's health at all costs.

154
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,208
Understood, sir.

155
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,083
I suggest we look around
to see if anyone is home.

156
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,583
WORF:
No need, Commander.

157
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,792
You heard me.

158
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,709
Thank God.

159
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,125
I'm Kareen Brianon,
Dr. Graves's assistant.

160
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,709
We're from a ship
called the<i> Enterprise.</i>

161
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,000
We monitored
your distress call

162
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,208
but then you never

163
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,709
acknowledged
our response.

164
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,291
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,834
I couldn't take the chance.

166
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,125
Chance?
What chance?

167
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,458
The chance that I might find out

168
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,959
someone was coming.

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,417
Kareen knew full well

170
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,667
that I would not be pleased,
to put it mildly.

171
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:16,542
I had no choice.

172
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,291
I refuse to stand by
and watch you deteriorate.

173
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,834
What symptoms
have you noticed?

174
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,625
He has pain, shortness
of breath, irritability...

175
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:25,875
Ridiculous!

176
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,083
I am as healthy
as a Rigellian ox.

177
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,083
He is not himself,
believe me.

178
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,083
His temper is completely
out of control.

179
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,500
Nonsense!

180
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:37,542
Ira.

181
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,542
I am a doctor.

182
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,542
Lieutenant Selar.

183
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,792
Ah, no offense, but I don't want
you touching me in any way.

184
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:45,959
It's no secret
that I don't like people much

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,542
and I like doctors even less.

186
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,709
That's funny.

187
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,709
I thought most doctors
were people.

188
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,917
Then you're wrong.

189
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,875
Ask any patient.

190
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:56,458
Though uh, huh,
I will admit, for a doctor

191
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,250
you're not
a bad-looking woman.

192
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,792
Well, well, well,
what have we got here?

193
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,667
Another lovely specimen
of womanhood.

194
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,166
I thought
you didn't like people.

195
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,667
Women aren't people.

196
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,834
They're women.

197
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,583
I'm Deanna Troi.

198
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,208
It's an honor to meet you,
Dr. Graves.

199
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,792
Yes, of course it is.

200
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:22,834
This is one of the truly
great moments of your life.

201
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,291
Excuse me, sir.

202
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:28,166
Are you a Romulan?

203
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,709
Hardly.

204
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,458
He's a Klingon, Kareen.

205
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,041
Kareen has lived here
since her father died

206
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,458
when she was very young.

207
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,166
Her only knowledge
of unhuman races
comes from me.

208
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:42,250
Klingons and Romulans
don't look much
alike, Kareen,

209
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,709
even though they
act much alike.

210
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,166
(<i> growls</i> )

211
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,583
Do I have
to stand here

212
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,834
and be insulted?

213
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,500
No insult intended,
Mr. Klingon.

214
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:52,750
You see, Doctor,

215
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,959
there's nothing wrong
with my hearing.

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,041
(<i> stifled groan</i> )

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,917
My, my, my, my, my...

218
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,291
Lieutenant Commander
Data...

219
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,750
Shh.

220
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,709
Absolutely no aesthetic value
whatsoever.

221
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,083
Looks like Soong's work.

222
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,583
Quite correct, sir.

223
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,917
Did you know Dr. Soong?

224
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,125
Know him? I taught him
everything he knows.

225
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,959
You could say that I was
the father of his work.

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,458
(<i> laughing</i> )
Which, uh, kind of makes
me your grandfather

227
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,750
doesn't it,
sonny?

228
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,875
Damn doctors!

229
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,166
Always sneaking up on one.

230
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,667
Attacking
from the rear.

231
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,834
Go on, gorgeous.

232
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,417
Spit it out.

233
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,041
Whatever the hell
it is, I can take it.

234
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,917
I've checked twice
to make certain.

235
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,542
You have Darnay's disease.

236
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,709
I'm sorry,
Dr. Graves.

237
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,792
It's in its final stage.

238
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:57,250
Can't you do something for him?

239
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:01,583
In all cases,
Darnay's is terminal.

240
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,875
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42437.7.</i>

241
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:19,333
<i>We've successfully repaired the</i>
<i>stricken liner</i> Constantinople.

242
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,875
<i>46 of her people suffered</i>

243
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,291
<i>They have been treated</i>

244
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,250
<i>and supplied</i>
<i>with the proper medicines.</i>

245
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,208
<i>Our task complete, we are</i>
<i>heading back to Gravesworld</i>

246
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,583
<i>with great dispatch.</i>

247
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:38,959
(<i> whistling</i>
<i>"If I Only Had a Heart"</i> )

248
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,375
(<i> coughing</i> )

249
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:45,709
(<i> continues whistling</i> )

250
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,333
I have noticed, Doctor...

251
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,333
Call me
grandpa.

252
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,458
(<i> coughing</i> )

253
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,875
Seems more touching
in my final hours.

254
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:57,166
I have noticed, Grandpa,
that you keep repeating

255
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,500
the same notes of a musical
phrase I am unfamiliar with.

256
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:05,417
Oh, it's, uh, it's
ancient little tune

257
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,125
called "If I Only Had a Heart"

258
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,917
a plaintive lament
sung by a mechanical man

259
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,291
who longs
to be human.

260
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,417
It's his only wish.

261
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,917
What happens to this man?

262
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,083
He finds out

263
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,333
he's human after all,
always was.

264
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,125
Just worried so much, he...
he never realized it.

265
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,417
Hmm, a happy ending.

266
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,417
The mechanical man gets
his wish.

267
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,250
Stories often have
happy endings.

268
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:38,083
It's life that throws you
for a loop.

269
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,458
It must be so
hard for you

270
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,917
to be so close to being human

271
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:49,291
and yet never really knowing
what it's like to know pain.

272
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,417
But...

273
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,250
pain is unpleasant, is it not?

274
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,458
Pain.
Lust.

275
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,208
Envy.

276
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,166
Pleasure.
Desire.

277
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,500
Do you know what desire is,
Data?

278
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:09,083
Desire?

279
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,250
To long for, to crave,
a wish, a request...

280
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,834
Do you<i> know</i> what desire is?

281
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,166
No.

282
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,208
I do not suppose
I will ever really know.

283
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,500
Oh, I feel pity for you.

284
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:30,375
Your existence must be a kind
of walking purgatory--

285
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,458
neither dead
nor alive

286
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,000
never really feeling anything.

287
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,458
Just existing.

288
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Just existing.

289
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,542
(<i> stifles cough</i> )

290
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,208
Oh, listen to me.

291
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,083
A dying man takes the time

292
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:54,834
to mourn a man
who will never know death.

293
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,291
Funny, isn't it?

294
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,709
Funny?

295
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,875
I have had great difficulty
determining what funny is.

296
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:12,792
I've had the same difficulty
most of my life.

297
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,208
We're much alike.

298
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,291
I'd say he has a week,
but that's only an estimate.

299
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,709
We do know that the disease

300
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,417
attacks the brain
and nervous system.

301
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,542
We can expect more
of the erratic behavior

302
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,500
of the kind
you've been noticing.

303
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:32,834
His feelings towards you
are very warm.

304
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,667
He's attracted to you
in many ways.

305
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,792
Attracted?

306
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:42,208
I know I've felt certain
feelings from him

307
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,959
and for him.

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,959
Had I been older

309
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,917
perhaps we could
have been...

310
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,458
but that's not the
way it worked out.

311
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,583
And now, it's like he's
afraid to face me.

312
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:59,250
The only one he talks to
is your friend, Data.

313
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,959
You mentioned
your impending death, Grandpa.

314
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,792
May I say
you face it

315
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,959
with remarkable courage
and stoicism.

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,750
Well, that is because
I'm an incredible man

317
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:13,750
possessing an iron will
and nerves of steel--

318
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,500
two traits that
have helped me

319
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,667
become the genius
I am today

320
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,208
as well as
the lady-killer

321
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,041
I was in days
gone by.

322
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,250
You condone homicide, sir?

323
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,750
It's an expression, Data.

324
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:30,500
It means I was once as beautiful
as I am smart.

325
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,083
Really, Grandpa?

326
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,250
No, not really.

327
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,375
But, what the hell, I'm dying.

328
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:41,792
I can remember my life
any way I want.

329
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:45,500
But I'll let you into
a little secret, sonny.

330
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:50,458
I don't really believe
I will be dying.

331
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,583
But the doctor...

332
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,917
Oh, I'll die.

333
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,166
But I won't
really be dead.

334
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:00,625
You see, I believe
I've learned

335
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,959
to transfer the wealth
of my knowledge

336
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500
into a computer.

337
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:05,917
Before I die

338
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,834
I plan
to transfer

339
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,458
my great intellect
into this machine

340
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,208
thus cheating the Grim Reaper
of his greatest prize.

341
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,875
But what would you
know of death?

342
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:24,834
It is a subject forever alien
to you.

343
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,542
That is not necessarily true,
Grandpa.

344
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,875
I do have an "off button,"
if you will.

345
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,834
Its activation robs me
of my consciousness

346
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,667
therefore,
rendering me dead

347
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:36,375
for all intents
and purposes.

348
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,000
It is not something
I enjoy contemplating.

349
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,291
Oh, I can
understand that.

350
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:47,417
Just where would Soong
position such a device?

351
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,375
Don't tell me.

352
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:52,208
Let me guess.

353
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,917
PICARD:
Captain to away team.
We're standing by.

354
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,125
I do not wish to interrupt
Data and the Doctor.

355
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,375
They seem to have developed
a genuine rapport

356
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,250
but the<i> Enterprise</i>
has reached its orbit

357
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,458
and I'd like to
transport Graves

358
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,625
to the ship as
soon as possible.

359
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,875
(<i> door opens</i> )

360
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:20,583
That will not be necessary,
Doctor.

361
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,667
He is gone.

362
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,208
Gone?

363
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,583
It happened just
a few moments ago in my arms.

364
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,166
Ira Graves is dead.

365
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,125
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

366
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,709
<i>I leave Gravesworld</i>
<i>with an empty feeling</i>

367
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,375
<i>in the knowledge that</i>
<i>our mission was unsuccessful.</i>

368
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:48,709
<i>Whatever scientific secrets</i>
<i>Ira Graves was about to unlock</i>

369
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,458
<i>have been lost forever.</i>

370
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,667
<i>Our immediate priority is</i>
<i>to reach the nearest Starbase</i>

371
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:57,458
<i>so that Graves's assistant</i>
<i>can get on with her life.</i>

372
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,875
Why didn't you contact Dr. Selar

373
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:06,291
when you saw that he was
beginning to... to go?

374
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,834
To do so would have
been pointless.

375
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,041
All things must pass.

376
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,583
May I go now, sir?

377
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,959
Yes, of course.

378
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:22,583
We will try to honor him

379
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,208
in the manner in which
he specified, will we not, sir?

380
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,959
I said we would, Data.

381
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,917
I am glad, sir.

382
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,041
It was his dying wish.

383
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,667
Hello, Data.

384
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:57,291
It's good to
see you again.

385
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:03,375
KAREEN:
The stars are so
beautiful from space.

386
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:07,041
You always did love the sky.

387
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,667
A stargazer--

388
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:11,458
that is what you are.

389
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,166
Did Ira tell you that?

390
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:18,583
I guess he's right.

391
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,959
I used to spend hours just
lying on a hill looking up.

392
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,959
Ira never told you
how beautiful you were to him.

393
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,166
He never told
you that, did he?

394
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,333
He could not tell you.

395
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,542
Do you understand?

396
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:40,959
Yes, I understand.

397
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:45,000
But he wanted to...

398
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,458
every waking moment.

399
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,125
And he wanted you
to know that.

400
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,417
You were everything to him.

401
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,750
PICARD:
He was a fine man

402
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:23,917
a man of rare gifts
and great accomplishments.

403
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:30,458
He will be sorely missed.

404
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,583
Does anyone else have
anything to say?

405
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:36,500
I believe I have
a few words to say, sir.

406
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:46,750
Just look at that face.

407
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:50,125
The face of a thinker,

408
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,750
a warrior,

409
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:55,291
a man...

410
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,875
for all seasons.

411
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,625
Yes, Ira Graves

412
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,709
was all that
and more

413
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,375
but he was
not perfect.

414
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:12,875
Perhaps his greatest flaw
was that he was too selfless.

415
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:15,667
He cared too much

416
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,333
for his fellow man

417
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,000
with nary a thought

418
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,291
for himself.

419
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:27,333
A man of limitless
accomplishments

420
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,041
and unbridled modesty.

421
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,208
I can safely say

422
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:38,166
that to know him
was to love him.

423
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,625
And to love him

424
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,750
was to know him.

425
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:47,041
Those who knew him

426
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,625
loved him

427
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:52,542
while those
who did not know him

428
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:56,750
loved him from afar.

429
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:57,792
Data...

430
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:59,625
I am almost finished, sir.

431
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,458
You are finished, Data.

432
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,250
We now commit the body
of Ira Graves

433
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:38,417
to the timeless depths of space.

434
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,959
I am sorry, sir.

435
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,375
Perhaps it was my admiration
for Grandpa

436
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:10,583
that got the best of me.

437
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,375
Grandpa?

438
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,166
That is the way
I think of him, sir.

439
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:18,375
My only living relative
no longer living.

440
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:20,458
Data...

441
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,458
I was only trying

442
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,625
to carry out his wishes, sir.

443
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:28,166
I just wanted to keep
my promise to him.

444
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,667
I know that, Data.

445
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:33,208
Look, I realize
you've been studying

446
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,875
the human equation
with great alacrity

447
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:38,709
but perhaps you've been
working at it too much.

448
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,250
Don't try so hard to be human.

449
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,125
Just be yourself.

450
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,458
All right?

451
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,000
Yes, sir.

452
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,250
I will work on staying
within myself.

453
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:54,291
Grand.

454
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,083
You're dismissed, Mr. Data.

455
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,125
Thank you, sir.

456
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:20,667
(<i> whistling</i>
<i>"If I Only Had a Heart"</i> )

457
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,709
<i>Captain's Personal Log.</i>

458
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,375
<i>Although Commander Data</i>
<i>has assured me</i>

459
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:31,458
<i>that his odd behavior</i>
<i>will return to normal,</i>

460
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,834
<i>I can't help thinking</i>

461
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,083
<i>that something went wrong</i>

462
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:37,125
<i>during his visit</i>
<i>to Gravesworld.</i>

463
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:39,834
I'm still
concerned, Captain.

464
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:42,667
I've never seen
him act like this.

465
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,750
Could it be
that grandfather analogy

466
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:47,083
that Graves planted
in his head?

467
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:50,917
Data is an orphan,
in a manner of speaking.

468
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:56,333
Is it possible
that the loss of Graves

469
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,333
might have affected him?

470
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,291
Touched him
on some emotional level

471
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,750
we didn't know
he possessed?

472
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:06,917
I hope you're right.

473
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,875
I hope that's
all it is.

474
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:16,500
That was a great speech, Data.

475
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:20,250
"To know him is to love him
is to know him."

476
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:21,792
Verbal composition

477
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:25,750
at its most
sophisticated level.

478
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,083
Your childlike mind
cannot appreciate

479
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,875
the timeworn wisdom
of my words.

480
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:33,125
Childlike mind?

481
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,542
When you get
to be my age

482
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,458
you will understand.

483
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,542
Your age?

484
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,417
Data, chronologically

485
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:43,208
you're not much
older than I am.

486
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,041
Well, you are only
as old as you feel.

487
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,709
Try to remember that, boy.

488
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:52,834
You're not turning
into a philosopher

489
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:53,959
are you, Mr. Data?

490
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,250
I am many things:
scholar,

491
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,000
artist,
philosopher,

492
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:01,834
lover, genius.

493
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,917
Data, what's wrong
with you?

494
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,333
KAREEN:
Wow, how beautiful.

495
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,875
PICARD:
I thought you might enjoy
the Bridge, Miss Brianon.

496
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:24,125
I'm aware of your
interest in science.

497
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,583
Perhaps you'd like
to see the computer...

498
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,417
Yes, and I am aware
of your interest in her.

499
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,291
What was that,
Commander?

500
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:34,625
Nothing, sir.

501
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,875
Nothing at all.

502
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:44,875
These are the
science stations.

503
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:46,834
PICARD:
From the Command Center here

504
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,083
we have control
of all of the science stations.

505
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:52,542
Data, what are you doing?

506
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,583
I detest hypocrisy.

507
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,208
I wish they would just
come out and admit it.

508
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,500
Admit what, Mr. Data?

509
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:04,917
That your interest in Kareen
is not purely professional.

510
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,208
Try as
you will

511
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,166
you cannot win her heart.

512
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,208
She does not care

513
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,125
for older men

514
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:17,667
or men of limited intellect.

515
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:22,750
Mr. Data, you will come
with me right now.

516
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:24,625
Do you understand me?

517
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,542
I understand.

518
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:29,667
I understand
all too well.

519
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:34,500
Removing the competition
will not help you, Picard.

520
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,291
Excuse me.

521
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,834
Do you know
what that was all about?

522
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,166
Jealousy.

523
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:52,917
Intense, burning jealousy.

524
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:56,709
A human emotion,
and it was coming from Data.

525
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,667
If you wish to apologize,
I am prepared to listen.

526
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:11,333
You expect me
to apologize to you?

527
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,750
You were a bit
rude to me.

528
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:14,917
Might make you
feel better

529
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,917
if you said
you were sorry.

530
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:20,208
Data, something has obviously
gone wrong with your circuitry.

531
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,417
That is ridiculous.

532
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,750
I am as healthy
as a Rigellian ox.

533
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:26,041
I wish I could
believe that.

534
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:28,875
I would accompany you
to Sick Bay

535
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,041
but I doubt if that
would do us any good.

536
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:35,333
Sick Bay?

537
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,792
Are you ill,
Captain?

538
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:40,333
I'm getting there.

539
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:43,959
I'm going to have Engineering
run a full physical on you.

540
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,375
I am sure that will not
be necessary, Captain.

541
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:49,542
I am fully capable of running
a circuit check on myself.

542
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:52,542
It will immediately
determine any abnormalities.

543
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,750
Do it.

544
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:55,667
That's an order.

545
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,333
Just as I expected.

546
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:03,166
I am fine.
Could not be better.

547
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,458
For the first time
since I've known you,

548
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,917
I don't believe you.

549
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:19,875
Try and hold still,
will you, Data?

550
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,458
Data, will you wait
for me in the corridor?

551
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,875
Why should I?

552
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:36,500
This concerns me more
than it does any of you.

553
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,792
You will wait for me
in the corridor.

554
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:48,625
His insubordination is growing
by leaps and bounds.

555
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:50,667
I could use discipline,

556
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:53,709
but I'd rather
try and help him.

557
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,125
Well, I wish I knew
what to suggest.

558
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:58,041
I'll be damned if I can find
a thing wrong with him.

559
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,834
Perhaps we're looking
in the wrong place.

560
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:01,959
Meaning?

561
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,500
Well, if Data's
physical health

562
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,000
is unimpaired

563
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:07,250
perhaps his mental health
needs to be addressed.

564
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:10,333
What, are you saying that
Data's losing his mind?

565
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:14,500
With your permission, Captain,
there is one way to find out.

566
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,000
Now, Data,
you remember

567
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:21,125
the psychotronic
stability examination.

568
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,500
We all had
to take it

569
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:24,625
before graduating
from the academy.

570
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:28,333
It was a waste of time then,
and it is a waste of time now.

571
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,875
It will just gauge your
psychological reactions

572
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:33,250
to the images
it projects.

573
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:34,291
Mm-hmm.

574
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,291
Watch the screen

575
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,333
and let your
mind go blank.

576
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:40,083
The device
will do the rest.

577
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,917
(<i> beeping</i> )

578
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:51,375
(<i> beeping increasing in speed)</i>

579
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:12,834
(<i> engines roaring</i> )

580
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:15,959
It's safe to say

581
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
that you're his best friend.

582
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:25,083
Is it possible to speculate
about what's happening to him?

583
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,667
Well, sir,
it's just a guess

584
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:31,333
but, sometimes,
he wants to be human

585
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,667
so badly
he can taste it.

586
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:36,041
I think he just tends
to get confused

587
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,875
when his human
qualities surface.

588
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:39,792
Mm. Go on.

589
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:41,542
Uh, witnessing
Graves's death

590
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,417
may have been
some sort of catalyst

591
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,291
for the way he...

592
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,583
I have the results
of the tests.

593
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,000
I ran them several times

594
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,041
to be sure.

595
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,750
To be sure of what?

596
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:55,917
There are two disparate
personalities

597
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,917
within Lieutenant
Commander Data--

598
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,208
each distinctly
different--

599
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,041
a dominant
and a recessive.

600
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,417
But he's an android,
is that possible?

601
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:05,875
It must be.

602
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:09,583
The dominant personality
is unstable.

603
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,083
Brilliant, but vain.

604
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,208
Sensitive,
yet paranoid.

605
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:17,125
And I believe it is prone
to irrationality.

606
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,875
Of course...

607
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,417
Sir?

608
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:22,083
Nothing. Go on.

609
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:27,625
It seems to have an especially
strong hatred of you, Captain.

610
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:30,583
Or to a lesser degree,
any authority figure.

611
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:34,834
And the worst part is
it's growing.

612
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:36,250
How do you mean?

613
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:39,875
The alien persona
is getting stronger

614
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:43,375
and gobbling up what is left
of the weaker ego:

615
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:45,083
the Data we know.

616
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:49,750
If something isn't done
to stop it immediately

617
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:52,834
we will lose our Data forever.

618
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,667
<i>Captain's Personal Log.</i>

619
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:00,458
<i>We have arrived</i>
<i>at Starbase Six</i>

620
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,458
<i>where Miss Brianon will await</i>
<i>transport back to Earth.</i>

621
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,917
<i>I'm greatly troubled</i>

622
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:07,291
<i>by the unusual behavior</i>
<i>of Commander Data</i>

623
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,792
<i>and fear that somehow</i>
<i>it is directly related</i>

624
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:12,417
<i>to the experiments</i>
<i>of Ira Graves.</i>

625
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,250
Where is Data now?

626
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,375
He should be
in his quarters.

627
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:18,917
You ordered him
not to leave.

628
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,333
Tell me, where is
Lieutenant Commander Data?

629
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,375
Current location:
Ten-Forward.

630
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:27,959
Lieutenant Worf

631
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,875
will you go to Ten-Forward
and keep an eye on Data?

632
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:33,959
Don't interfere
with his actions

633
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,375
unless you hear
otherwise from me.

634
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:39,166
Worf here, sir.
Acknowledged.

635
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,458
I want to know

636
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,333
more about what happened
down on Gravesworld.

637
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,500
Lieutenant Selar

638
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,667
report to the Captain's
Ready Room.

639
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,417
Hello, Kareen.

640
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:02,500
Don't you think it's time
we stopped pretending?

641
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:06,917
You know who I am.

642
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,709
You're Data.

643
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,959
You do know who I am.

644
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,458
Ira?

645
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,625
It is me.
I am here.

646
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:27,875
I am alive.

647
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:29,250
How?

648
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:36,917
I deactivated Data
and transferred my mind

649
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:38,792
into his frame.

650
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:41,542
I never imagined
how much of my...

651
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:44,667
<i>myself</i> I would retain.

652
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:45,750
My feelings.

653
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,583
My dreams.

654
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:50,291
They won't let you
get away with it.

655
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,125
They'll try to stop you.

656
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,667
How can they?

657
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,583
It is my body now.

658
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,667
It is out of their hands.

659
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:00,083
Doctor, tell me,
how much time

660
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:01,625
did Data and Graves
spend together?

661
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,000
They were together
practically

662
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:04,625
the entire time
we were on the planet.

663
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:05,709
Always alone?

664
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,792
Yes. Always.

665
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:10,875
Doctor, what was your impression
of Graves?

666
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:14,208
He seemed brilliant,
egocentric, arrogant,

667
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,792
chauvinistic...

668
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,542
Sound familiar?

669
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,709
Something wonderful
has happened.

670
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,792
I can take a deep breath now

671
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:31,667
without feeling
stabbing pain.

672
00:35:31,709 --> 00:35:35,875
I will never have
to face death again.

673
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:37,417
Think of the things
I will accomplish

674
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:40,166
over the next thousand years.

675
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:43,583
What?

676
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:48,792
Oh, I know what
you are thinking.

677
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:51,709
There is no need
to worry.

678
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,792
I will create an android
body for you, too.

679
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:58,542
We can witness
the end of time together.

680
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:08,792
Why are you crying, Kareen?

681
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,542
I can love you now.

682
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:15,709
The way I always
wanted to.

683
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,125
It was not right before.

684
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:23,083
I was too old for you...
too weak.

685
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:27,041
Now I can be everything
you want me to be.

686
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:30,875
I won't let you
put me in a machine.

687
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:33,792
I want to
live my life.

688
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:36,625
I won't let you
take it away from me.

689
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:41,000
Ira, Ira,
you're hurting me.

690
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:57,083
Worf to Captain Picard.

691
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,667
Commander Data
has left Ten-Forward.

692
00:36:58,709 --> 00:36:59,667
Should I follow?

693
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:00,792
Negative.

694
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:02,792
I'll handle
this myself.

695
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,917
He was an expert
in cybernetics.

696
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,709
Yes.

697
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,583
Our memorial service
may have been premature.

698
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:15,125
What an achievement.

699
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:19,417
So long as men can breathe
or eyes can see

700
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,875
so long
lives this.

701
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:25,208
And this gives life to thee.

702
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,291
He was working
on bridging the gap

703
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,041
between man and machine.

704
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:34,750
It seems he built that bridge.

705
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:37,125
I may be forced
to tear it down.

706
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:55,667
I can hear you coming, Captain.

707
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:59,041
My ears are better than
the average dog's, you know.

708
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:07,458
I know who you are
and what you've done.

709
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,250
Of course you do.

710
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,583
I came here to talk to Data.

711
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,959
Hmm-mm.

712
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,709
I cannot allow that.

713
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:24,208
I understand your desperation--

714
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,041
the shock of learning
you were dying--

715
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:29,875
but you have no right
to do what you've done.

716
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:32,834
I have every right, Captain.

717
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,667
I am man,
he is machine.

718
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:35,917
There is
no question

719
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:39,250
who must live
and what must die.

720
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:41,250
What of Data?

721
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,959
(<i> chuckling</i> )

722
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,792
Data?

723
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:49,792
Before me, he was nothing.

724
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:51,834
Just a walking
tin can

725
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,250
with circuits
for intestines.

726
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,500
Pathetic.

727
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,959
Without heart,
a man is meaningless.

728
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:08,959
I would not come up here
if I were you, Captain.

729
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,125
I might not like it.

730
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:27,375
DATA:
You are most fortunate,
my dear Captain

731
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:30,041
that I am not a violent man.

732
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,291
Not a violent man?

733
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,917
This... this is not my fault.

734
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:50,208
They told me I was not
supposed to be up here.

735
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,875
They should not
have done that.

736
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:53,625
Graves,
listen to me.

737
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:58,500
No one can deny the significance
of your transformation...

738
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:03,625
but I don't believe that
this was part of your plan.

739
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,000
Encountering Data

740
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:07,000
was mere coincidence--

741
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:11,125
one that offered you more
than you could have dreamed--

742
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:13,375
but something has gone wrong.

743
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:14,792
Look here.

744
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:23,792
Graves, this experiment
must be terminated.

745
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:27,375
This is idiotic.

746
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:29,166
Picard to Sick Bay.

747
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:30,166
PULASKI:
Yes, Captain.

748
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,583
How is Miss
Brianon?

749
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:34,875
Her left hand is fractured
in two places.

750
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:36,458
We've just begun treatment.

751
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,959
I'm afraid there are two
more injuries in Engineering.

752
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:41,750
I'm on my way.

753
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:45,041
Who's next?

754
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:48,542
These were all accidents.

755
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:49,625
I did not intend...

756
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,375
How many more
accidents?

757
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:54,750
You must leave this body.

758
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:58,208
No. I live here now.

759
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:03,834
Graves, every man has his time.

760
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,041
Every man.

761
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:06,500
Without exception.

762
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:08,583
But you've
cheated.

763
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:13,875
You have extended your life
at the expense of another.

764
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:15,792
Graves, give Data back.

765
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:16,875
Give him back.

766
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:19,375
Data is dead.
No.

767
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:21,208
He must not be lost.

768
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:25,208
He's not simply
an android.

769
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,166
He's a life-form.
Entirely unique.

770
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:29,625
Data is not human.

771
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:30,625
He is...

772
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:32,291
He is
different, yes.

773
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:34,291
But that does not
make him expendable

774
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:36,875
or any less significant.

775
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:38,834
No being is so important

776
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:41,000
that he can usurp
the rights of another.

777
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,500
Now set him free.

778
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,750
No!

779
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,125
How many...

780
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:04,166
how many more accidents?

781
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,083
Data-- where is he?

782
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:18,417
Just take it easy, Captain.

783
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:21,041
We can't afford to
take it easy, Doctor.

784
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:29,166
Tell me, where is
Lieutenant Commander Data?

785
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:39,041
Data?

786
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:42,458
Data!

787
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:46,125
Data, can you hear me?

788
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:52,333
Geordi.

789
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:54,375
Yeah.

790
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:56,792
May I ask a question?

791
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:59,333
I think you just did.

792
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:00,709
Quite correct.

793
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,333
Then may I ask another question
after this one?

794
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:06,333
You can ask me
anything you want.

795
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,500
Why am I lying
on the floor

796
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:09,875
in this
undignified position

797
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:11,875
with the four of you
standing over me

798
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:13,583
displaying expressions
of conc...

799
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,500
I've heard more
than enough.

800
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:18,083
You're you again.

801
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:22,500
KAREEN:
Captain...
Captain, look at this.

802
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,917
He's in there.

803
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:35,417
Ira put himself
in the computer.

804
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,000
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

805
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,834
<i>We've said good-bye</i>
<i>to Kareen Brianon</i>

806
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,208
<i>with the hopeful feeling</i>

807
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,041
<i>that her future</i>
<i>will be a bright one.</i>

808
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:54,083
<i>The intellect of Ira Graves</i>

809
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:56,208
<i>has been deposited</i>
<i>into our computer.</i>

810
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,959
<i>There is knowledge,</i>
<i>but no consciousness.</i>

811
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,667
<i>The human equation</i>
<i>has been lost.</i>

812
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:04,166
And you don't
remember anything?

813
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,542
Not a thing.

814
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:10,417
To know him is to love him
is to know him?

815
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:13,834
Perhaps it is best
that I do not remember.

816
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,166
I trust I did
nothing unbecoming

817
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:17,875
to a Starfleet officer?

818
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:20,750
Does wrestling with
a Klingon targ ring a bell?

819
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:23,834
Mr. Crusher, take us
out of orbit.

820
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,834
Aye, sir.

821
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,875
Did I win?
