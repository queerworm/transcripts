1
00:00:01,208 --> 00:00:05,333
PICARD:<i> Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42286.3.</i>

2
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:10,625
<i>We have arrived on station</i>
<i>at coordinates 3629 by 584</i>

3
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,208
<i>three days early</i>
<i>for our rendezvous</i>

4
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,667
<i>with the USS</i> Victory.

5
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:16,917
<i>There is nothing to do now</i>

6
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,625
<i>but hold this position</i>
<i>and wait.</i>

7
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:24,333
(<i> indistinct chatter</i> )

8
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,333
Yes, Commander?

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,709
Is there a problem?

10
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:28,667
Chief engineer La Forge
called for me, "urgent."

11
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:29,875
Oh, of course.

12
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:33,083
He's, um, over there
with the<i> Victory.</i>

13
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:42,834
Geordi, I've just had
a strange conversation

14
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,166
with your assistant.

15
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,667
Although it is three days

16
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,458
until we rendezvous
with starship<i> Victory,</i> she...

17
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,875
She believes it has
already arrived?

18
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,041
Not the starship, my friend.

19
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,458
The original.

20
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:01,083
This is my gift

21
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,208
to the<i> Victory's</i> 
Captain Zimbata.

22
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:06,041
Ah, most unusual.

23
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,458
I served with him
as an ensign.

24
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,417
Sure wish he'd been
in command of this<i> Victory.</i>

25
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,625
Wind and sail.

26
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,000
That's the proper way
to move a ship.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,792
But, Geordi, your
Starfleet specialty

28
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:21,417
is antimatter power,
dilithium regulators...

29
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:23,250
That's exactly why
this fascinates me, Data.

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,250
See, it's human nature
to love what we don't have.

31
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,166
Simpler days, huh?

32
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,792
Anyway, stringing this rigging

33
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:36,250
has made me dream
of handling sails...

34
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,750
This is not
a computer simulation?

35
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,917
Data, the whole point
in doing something like this

36
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,709
is to make it by hand.

37
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,625
Hmm.

38
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:49,333
Geordi, your message
said "urgent."

39
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,083
Ah, so it is.

40
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,125
While we're waiting
to rendezvous with the<i> Victory</i>

41
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,208
we have time for me
to be Watson.

42
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:58,250
More properly,
your Watson.

43
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,583
My Watson?

44
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,667
Well, I've just shown you
one of my dreams.

45
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:04,917
Now let's go and share
in one of yours.

46
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,375
Ah, yes.

47
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,792
That does seem only fair.

48
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,000
Clancy, I'll be
gone for awhile.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,333
See that no one touches this.

50
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,959
Aye, sir, and where
can I reach you?

51
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,166
DATA:
He can be reached
at 221B Baker Street.

52
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,750
Sir?

53
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:45,041
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

54
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:49,583
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

55
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,000
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,583
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

57
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:59,333
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

58
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:03,792
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

59
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,000
Computer,
select at random a mystery

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,792
by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

61
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,375
in which I will
play Sherlock Holmes

62
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:11,000
and Lieutenant La Forge
will be Dr. John Watson.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,208
Program complete.

64
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,834
You may enter.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,917
Excellent.

66
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:36,542
Look at all
the detail.

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,083
So you say everything in here
has some significance?

68
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,125
Holmes collected
nothing--

69
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,583
neither trinkets
nor thoughts--

70
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,625
which was not specifically
significant to him.

71
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,834
This?

72
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,125
The emerald tie pin

73
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,875
presented to Holmes
by Queen Victoria

74
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:05,000
after he solved the
theft of the Bruce-
Partington plans.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,458
A copy of Whitaker's Almanac,

76
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,834
which provided Holmes with
the key to the secret code

77
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:23,583
in "The Valley of Fear."

78
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,709
The snuff box

79
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:33,250
of Wilhelm Gottsreich
Sigismond von Ormstein.

80
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,583
LA FORGE:
All right, Data, you solve
the cases and get all the gifts.

81
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,834
What do I do?

82
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:41,542
Primarily,
as Dr. Watson,

83
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,917
you will keep
a written record

84
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,875
of everything
I say and do.

85
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,875
Hmm?

86
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,333
For later publication.

87
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:54,875
And the famous Holmes violin.

88
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,583
He purchased this
in a pawn shop

89
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,125
in Tottenham Court Road
for 55 shillings,

90
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:05,959
which he considered to be
a very good investment.

91
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:13,083
(<i> plays beautifully</i> )

92
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,375
GEORDI:
In the hands of some,
the violin

93
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,250
is a wondrous thing,

94
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,875
equally capable
of stirring the soul

95
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:28,792
to the heights of bliss
as to the depths of despair.

96
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:32,000
But...

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Data, that's incredible.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,542
How can you play it like that?

99
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:41,041
Merely throwing myself
into the part, Watson.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,959
But in the hands
of my friend--

101
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,375
Mr. Sherlock Holmes--

102
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:57,542
the violin ceases to be
a musical instrument at all

103
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,750
and becomes...

104
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,834
DATA:
Watson...

105
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,834
we are about to have guests.

106
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:03,834
How could
you possibly...?

107
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:04,917
(<i> knocking</i> )

108
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:05,959
Be a good fellow

109
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,208
and answer that.

110
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,792
Let's not keep
the inspector waiting.

111
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:10,959
Inspector who?

112
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,417
Lestrade, of course.

113
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:16,959
Holmes, are you there, man?

114
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,041
Thank the almighty you're
available today, Holmes.

115
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,041
I'm in a deuce
of a dilemma.

116
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,000
And may I say
your perturbation

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,917
becomes you,
Inspector Lestrade,

118
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:27,083
whilst simultaneously
affording me the opportunity

119
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,917
to yet again
serve queen and country.

120
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,709
Data, Holmes really
talked like that?

121
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:34,917
Absolutely.

122
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,041
We need your
help, Holmes.

123
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,500
You see...
this gentleman here--

124
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,709
the emissary
of a foreign government--

125
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:42,000
has been the victim

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,667
of a most accidentally
wicked crime.

127
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:46,375
Damn.

128
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,917
Haven't they invented
the electric light by now?

129
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,959
What, dear fellow?

130
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,041
(<i> clucks tongue</i> )

131
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,542
Watson...

132
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,125
Pray continue, Inspector.

133
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,959
To put the matter
simply, Holmes,

134
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,709
this man was accosted by gypsies
intent on depriving him

135
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,792
of his most valuable
possessions.

136
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,709
And in the process of picking
his pockets clean

137
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,041
they also happened to bag

138
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,250
a photograph this
man was carrying.

139
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,041
Great Scott, the photograph.

140
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,458
I believe you will find,
Inspector, that this
emissary here works

141
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,333
not for but<i> against</i> 
the King of Bohemia.

142
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,083
And that photograph

143
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:30,625
of the king and his mistress
is to be used for blackmail.

144
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,208
Further, upon deeper reflection

145
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,792
you will deduce, as did I...

146
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:37,083
Computer,
freeze program.

147
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:41,792
Exit.

148
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,875
Geordi...

149
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,417
Where are you going,
Geordi?

150
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:50,542
I'm done.

151
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,500
But...

152
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,458
But...

153
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,458
Geordi, I was about
to reveal the fact

154
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,417
that the sir
is in fact a madam...

155
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,000
Data, what was the point
in going to the holodeck?

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,500
To solve a Sherlock
Holmes mystery.

157
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,667
Exactly.

158
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,291
But you've got them
all memorized.

159
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,834
The first time anyone
opens their mouth

160
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:13,875
you've got it solved.

161
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,417
So there's really no mystery.

162
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:16,792
If there's no mystery,
there's no game.

163
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:23,542
No game,
no fun.

164
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,458
Oh, I'm not upset
with you, Data, really.

165
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,917
It's just that we go through all
the trouble to arrange the time

166
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:30,000
to go down to the holodeck,
to get the proper wardrobe

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,166
to get into character
and then...

168
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,834
(<i> snaps fingers</i> )
Boom!

169
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,709
Before we even get started,
you jump to the end.

170
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:40,792
You see, I was looking
forward to the mystery.

171
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,834
Then I should have extended
the sequence of events?

172
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,333
Oh, I'm not getting through.

173
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,083
The fun in the program, Data,

174
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:52,583
was in the attempt
to solve a mystery.

175
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,625
Is that not exactly
what we were doing?

176
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,208
PULASKI:
You're wasting your
breath, Lieutenant.

177
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,333
Saying that to Data

178
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:03,125
is asking a computer
not to compute.

179
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,959
Am I so different
from you, Doctor?

180
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:08,709
Are you able to cease
thinking on command?

181
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,667
In medicine, I'm often faced
with puzzles

182
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,000
that I do not know
the answer to.

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
She's right, Data.

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,125
You always know the answer.

185
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,542
To feel the
thrill of victory

186
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:20,333
there has to be the
possibility of failure.

187
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,875
Where's the victory
in winning a battle

188
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,625
you can't possibly lose?

189
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,041
Are you suggesting
there is some value in losing?

190
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,375
Yes, yes, that's
the great teacher.

191
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:35,291
We humans learn more often
from a failure or a mistake

192
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,959
than we do from
an easy success.

193
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:38,959
But not you.

194
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,375
You learn by rote.

195
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,375
To you, all is memorization
and recitation.

196
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,834
LA FORGE:
Oh, I don't know
about all that.

197
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,709
Deductive reasoning
is one of Data's strengths.

198
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,041
Yes, and Holmes, too.

199
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,667
But Holmes understood
the human soul--

200
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:51,959
the dark flecks
that drive us

201
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,959
that turn the innocent
into the evil.

202
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,917
That understanding
is beyond Data.

203
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:01,875
Now you're just being unfair,
Doctor.

204
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,875
I don't think so, Lieutenant.

205
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,083
Your artificial friend
doesn't have a prayer

206
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,875
of solving a Holmes mystery
that he hasn't read.

207
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,917
I have read them all.

208
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:12,417
You see?

209
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:15,000
Maybe the computer could
create one in Holmes' style--

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,125
one where you wouldn't
know the outcome.

211
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,458
As I said,
he wouldn't have a prayer.

212
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,583
I accept
your challenge, Doctor.

213
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,917
Good for you, Data.

214
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,291
We shall return
to the holodeck

215
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,333
where I shall dare it
to defeat me.

216
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:33,583
And you, madam, are invited
to be a witness.

217
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,417
I wouldn't miss it.

218
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:37,458
Come, Watson.

219
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,583
There.

220
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,041
I've instructed the computer

221
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,709
to give us a Sherlock
Holmes-type problem,

222
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,375
but not one written specifically
by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

223
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,625
So this will be
something new,

224
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,041
something created
by the computer?

225
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,208
Exactly.

226
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,250
Will that be
sufficient, Doctor?

227
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,792
We'll see.

228
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:05,875
COMPUTER:
Program complete.

229
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,625
You may enter.

230
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,417
WOMAN:
Nice and fresh!

231
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,041
MAN:
Pies! Pies!

232
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,917
Some are meat, some are sweet!

233
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:20,625
Pies! Pies!

234
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,625
They're lovely!

235
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:26,000
Pies! Pies!

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,542
Some are meat,
and some are sweet!

237
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:30,792
Very impressive.

238
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,417
Your first visit
to a holodeck, Doctor?

239
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, with this level
of sophistication.

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,041
How does it work?

241
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,250
The real London
was hundreds

242
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,166
of square kilometers
in size.

243
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,417
This is no larger
than the holodeck, of course,

244
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,458
so the computer adjusts
by placing images

245
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,333
of more distant perspective
on the holodeck walls.

246
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,125
But with an image
so perfect

247
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,083
that you'd actually
have to touch the wall
to know it was there.

248
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,709
And the computer fools
you in other ways.

249
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,834
I say, Holmes,
where shall we head?

250
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:58,875
The theater, Rule's,
or a concert perhaps?

251
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,125
Stop him!

252
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,834
Stop him!
He stole my goods.

253
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,291
No!

254
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,750
It is a ruse.

255
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,333
This way.

256
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,333
What's over here, Data?

257
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,583
What are you doing,
Data? Tell us.

258
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,458
The running youth
was a ploy.

259
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,208
The real crime is here

260
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,291
and the intended victim
is that man--

261
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,542
Mr. Jabez Wilson, employee
of the Red-Headed League

262
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:30,208
dupe of a gang
of criminals.

263
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,417
I saw this plaque...

264
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,083
And this rope
hanging from the bell,

265
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,583
which enabled me to deduce

266
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,083
that Mr. Jabez Wilson
was headed here

267
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,667
to meet a most distasteful
and untimely demise...

268
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,792
from this!

269
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,959
(<i> bell rings</i> )

270
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,375
Fraud!

271
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,959
You didn't deduce anything.

272
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,792
All you did was
recognize elements

273
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,166
from two different
Holmes stories.

274
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,792
Fraud.

275
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:58,709
Reasoning, from the general
to the specific.

276
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,041
Is that not the very
definition of deduction?

277
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,792
Is that not the way
Sherlock Holmes worked?

278
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,959
Variations
on a theme.

279
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,959
Now, now do you
see my point?

280
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,041
All that he knows is stored
in his memory banks.

281
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,041
Inspiration.

282
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,166
Original thought.

283
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,208
All the true strength
of Holmes...

284
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,458
it's not possible
for our friend.

285
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,583
I'll give you credit
for your vast knowledge,

286
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,625
but your circuits
would just short out

287
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,834
if you were confronted

288
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:27,083
with a truly
original mystery.

289
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,834
It's elementary,
dear Data.

290
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:29,959
Now, wait a minute, Doctor.

291
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:33,166
We'll see whose
circuits short out.

292
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,959
Computer, arch.

293
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,291
Are you sure you want

294
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,917
to put yourself
through this, Lieutenant?

295
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,583
Better wilted laurels
than no laurels at all.

296
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,959
Computer, override
previous programming.

297
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:53,917
Okay. A program that
definitely challenges Data.

298
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,375
Now, it has to
deal with events

299
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,917
that he has no
previous knowledge of.

300
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:00,834
Computer, in the Holmesian style

301
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,625
create a mystery
to confound Data

302
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:08,333
with an opponent
who has the ability
to defeat him.

303
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,625
COMPUTER:
Define parameters of program.

304
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,166
What does that mean?

305
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,166
The computer wants to know
how far to take the game.

306
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,500
You mean, it's giving
you a chance to
limit your risk?

307
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,959
No, the parameters will be
whatever is necessary

308
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,125
in order to accomplish
the directive.

309
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:26,792
Create an adversary
capable of defeating Data.

310
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:30,709
(<i> beeping</i> )

311
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:32,917
What was that?

312
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:34,166
Lieutenant?

313
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,750
An odd surge
of power, sir.

314
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:40,083
It's gone now.

315
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,792
(<i> dog barking</i> )

316
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,000
(<i> woman singing</i> )

317
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,542
(<i> people talking</i> )

318
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:53,125
Interesting.

319
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:58,667
The same London...
but slightly different.

320
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:16,250
Is something wrong, Professor?

321
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,375
I... I feel
like a new man.

322
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:26,166
That dark fellow
there used the word
"arch" and then...

323
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,083
I wonder.

324
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,166
Arch.

325
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,166
What have we here?

326
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,208
Computer standing by.

327
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,417
What are you?

328
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,625
If you refer
to the arch you ordered

329
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,458
it provides computer control.

330
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:58,583
Do you wish
to input any commands?

331
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,834
Not at this time.

332
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:01,250
(<i> gasping</i> )

333
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,792
It's dark magic, Moriarty.

334
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,792
The best kind, I'm sure.

335
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,792
But I need information.

336
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,166
MAN: Here we go!

337
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,333
(<i> continues indistinctly</i> )

338
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:24,667
Data... I mean, Holmes, old boy,
what are we looking for?

339
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,834
For whatever finds us,
my dear Watson.

340
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:29,125
(<i> woman screaming</i> )

341
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,041
She has been abducted.

342
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,458
Who has?

343
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,208
The good doctor.

344
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,125
Mm, I think she's hiding.

345
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,333
She's going to lead you
on a wild goose chase

346
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,667
and then recount the story

347
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,709
to everyone from here
to Alpha Centauri.

348
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:47,417
Watson.
Hmm?

349
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:50,625
The doctor has been
carried away by two men.

350
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,250
One is tall.

351
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,917
The other is shorter,
left-handed,

352
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:58,458
and is employed
in a laboratory.

353
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,458
And how do you
know that?

354
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,291
One set of footfalls
is widely spaced.

355
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,625
The other is evenly spaced,
closer together.

356
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:09,542
Further, on the ground,
you can see the swirling scrapes

357
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:12,917
made by his left shoe
as he twists behind,

358
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:15,542
presumably to see
if he's being followed.

359
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:18,417
Left-footed
means left-handed.

360
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,208
The dark colorings
of the scrapes

361
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,500
are the leavings
of natural rubber

362
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,792
a type of
nonconductive sole

363
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:28,208
used by researchers
experimenting with electricity.

364
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,834
Finally...

365
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:32,625
there can be no argument.

366
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:36,500
The game is afoot.

367
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,834
Come, Watson!

368
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:45,166
(<i> loud footsteps</i> )

369
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,750
Hear that?

370
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,500
What do those footfalls
tell you, Watson?

371
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,250
That we're on the right track.

372
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,458
More particularly,

373
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,875
that our opposition does indeed

374
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,417
consist of two men

375
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,166
and that one of them is carrying

376
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,458
the bound-and-gagged
Dr. Pulaski.

377
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,125
Now, you know all of this
because you read it

378
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,417
in the Holmes story, right?

379
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:05,458
Not at all.

380
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,500
Because we do not hear
the doctor's footfalls,

381
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,542
we must assume that
she is being carried.

382
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,333
And since we do not
hear her cries for help,

383
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,709
we know that she is gagged.

384
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:16,208
Further, both sets of footfalls

385
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,959
are heavy and masculine.

386
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:20,083
One man seems to shuffle
and stumble

387
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,417
in an irregular pattern.

388
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:23,041
Since the ground is level,

389
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,583
we must conclude
that Dr. Pulaski

390
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,917
is struggling against one
of her captors,

391
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,083
sporadically knocking
him off stride.

392
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,750
Deduction - pure and simple.

393
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,166
Well, not that simple.

394
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,417
<i>( loud footsteps )</i>

395
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:40,083
Footfalls!

396
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,375
<i>( loud footsteps )</i>

397
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,083
There they are again, Watson.

398
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:53,291
I dare say we have caught up
rather nicely with our quarry.

399
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,041
There should be
a doorway.

400
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,125
Come on.

401
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,250
Holmes, thank God
you're here.

402
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,375
Make way, please.
Make way.

403
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,083
Make way
for Sherlock Holmes.

404
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,500
It's murder, Holmes,
murder most foul.

405
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,625
Well, Holmes, what
do you say, man?

406
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,291
There is nothing here
of relevance.

407
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,542
I do not see how this connects

408
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,041
with the disappearance
of the doctor.

409
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,125
Doctor?

410
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,041
Dr. Watson is right
here, Holmes.

411
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,333
Dr. Kate Pulaski.

412
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,458
But do not concern yourself,
Inspector.

413
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,125
You have enough on your mind.

414
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,333
She was with you?

415
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:37,041
Inspector, if I may
be of assistance.

416
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,250
As I take note of
this... dead man

417
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,583
I deduce that he
was strangled.

418
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,959
You see, the finger
marks on his throat

419
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,667
indicate the cause of death

420
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:47,667
and, as there are
signs of struggle,
it's quite obvious

421
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,458
that the murderer
was a stranger

422
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:54,041
who attacked him
from behind.

423
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,417
Is that correct, Holmes?

424
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:58,500
No, look at his shoes.

425
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,291
He's more a convict,

426
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,917
released today
from Dartmoor prison.

427
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:05,125
He spent the day in a tavern

428
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,500
consuming large
quantities of gin

429
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,166
with his killer

430
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,417
who followed him to this very
spot, and waited over there

431
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:16,417
until the victim slipped
into a drunken stupor.

432
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:18,166
Then, out of fear,

433
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,709
motivated only
by self-protection

434
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,834
strangled him.

435
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:24,041
There is your killer,
Inspector.

436
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,083
(<i> gasping</i> )

437
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,667
LESTRADE:
Seize her!

438
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,792
And, when you check,

439
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:31,000
I believe you will find
that this poor soul

440
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,917
is the victim's
common-law wife

441
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,166
who has been dreading
the release

442
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,875
of this vile
and abusive man.

443
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,333
Holmes, the poor woman
hardly has the strength

444
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,458
to strangle a
man this size.

445
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,834
Not with her hands, no.

446
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,917
But with this!

447
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:45,709
When used as a garrote,

448
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:48,834
these beads will make a mark
quite similar to fingerprints.

449
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:52,542
And, my dear Watson, you will
note on the victim's throat

450
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:54,250
the marks are
too evenly spaced

451
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,792
to have been made
by human hands.

452
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,417
LESTRADE:
Astounding,
Holmes.

453
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,291
Not really, Inspector.

454
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,959
And now, for strictly personal
reasons, I must leave.

455
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,208
Come, Watson.

456
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:12,875
This murder does not
connect with our case.

457
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:14,917
Come on.

458
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,000
Hurry it up, quickly.

459
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,875
Come on.

460
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,000
Data, wait.

461
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,208
If this murder
isn't connected

462
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,917
to the disappearance
of Dr. Pulaski

463
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:25,709
then the computer is running
an independent program.

464
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:27,375
Yes.
Why?

465
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,583
I do not know
and that is what puzzles me.

466
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,208
Then you don't know what's
going to happen next.

467
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,333
No.

468
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,750
Oh, that's what
I want to hear.

469
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,875
Where to now?

470
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,625
We will find
Dr. Pulaski in here.

471
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,834
How do you know that?

472
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,417
It is the only obvious choice.

473
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:42,542
Well, why is the
obvious choice

474
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:44,000
all of a sudden
the right one?

475
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,792
I mean, isn't this a
game of misdirection?

476
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:46,917
Not anymore.

477
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:48,417
He wants us to find him.

478
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:49,583
Who does?

479
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,083
The master criminal.

480
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,750
The man Holmes
could only defeat

481
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,667
at the cost of his own life
at Reichenbach Falls.

482
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,792
Our adversary,
my dear Watson

483
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,125
is none other
than professor Moriarty himself.

484
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,917
Now this is
getting interesting.

485
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:18,667
Well, there's nothing here
but these barrels.

486
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,125
And a trail

487
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,959
which is so well marked
that, obviously,

488
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:25,291
we are meant to follow it.

489
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,041
Oh, no, Data.

490
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,333
It's another dead end.

491
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,875
No, Watson,
not a dead end at all.

492
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,542
Hello?

493
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:42,542
What's this?

494
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:44,875
Can you see the scratches?

495
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:55,959
(<i> squeaking</i> )

496
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,583
The doctor was right.

497
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,166
Finally, we have
a game worth playing.

498
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:38,125
The time for games is over.

499
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:44,500
Professor Moriarty,
I presume?

500
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,750
How do you know that?

501
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,083
He is the one
worthy opponent

502
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,083
created by the author,
Conan Doyle.

503
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,709
And like the spider,
I feel the strings vibrate

504
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,875
whenever anyone new
chances into my web.

505
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:01,000
Welcome, my dear Holmes...
but not Holmes.

506
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,375
And Dr. Watson...

507
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,208
but not
Watson.

508
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,625
Data, what does he mean?

509
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,917
How does he know we're not
who we appear to be?

510
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:10,208
Where is Dr. Pulaski?

511
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,583
She's here.

512
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,542
She would not have
told you anything.

513
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:17,291
She has provided many answers.

514
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:20,959
Do you forget I have always been
your equal, my dear Holmes?

515
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:23,083
I have read her expressions.

516
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:28,834
What she has not said
is as important as her words.

517
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:30,583
Have you injured her?

518
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,458
I will if necessary.

519
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:36,625
But my mind
is crowded with images

520
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:39,583
thoughts I do not understand
yet cannot purge.

521
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,041
They plague me.

522
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,959
You and your associate
look and act so oddly.

523
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,208
Yet though I have never met

524
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,417
nor seen the like
of either of you,

525
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,375
I am familiar with you both.

526
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,208
It's very confusing.

527
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,917
I have felt new realities
at the edge of my consciousness

528
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:56,375
readying to break through.

529
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:59,083
Surely, Holmes,
if that's who you truly are

530
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:02,000
you, of all people, can
appreciate what I mean.

531
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,500
Data...

532
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,709
Say nothing.

533
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:06,917
I know that there is
a great power

534
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:11,667
called computer, wiser
than the oracle at Delphi.

535
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:14,875
A power which controls
all of this

536
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:16,917
and to which we can speak.

537
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:18,333
Arch.

538
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,250
Data, this isn't right.

539
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,500
A holographic image

540
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,333
should not be able
to call for the arch.

541
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:29,667
It has described
a great monstrous shape

542
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:33,000
on which I am like a fly
stuck on a turtle's back

543
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,792
adrift in a great emptiness.

544
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:37,375
What is this, Holmes?

545
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,792
Data.

546
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,792
Data, wait.

547
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,000
Data!

548
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,959
Wait!

549
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:00,166
Data.

550
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:03,000
Why does it frighten you,
Holmes?

551
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,250
Data.

552
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,083
Data, will you please
tell me what's going on?

553
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,875
Computer, exit.

554
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:19,458
Computer, execute
complete shutdown

555
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,500
of the holodeck.

556
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Access denied.

557
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,750
Explain.

558
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,959
Override protocol
has been initiated.

559
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,750
It's still running.

560
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,333
The program didn't shut down.

561
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,375
We must see the captain.

562
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,333
Data, wait, what is it?

563
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,583
What's on that paper?

564
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,000
And why can't we shut
down the holodeck?

565
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,041
Data!

566
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,208
This.

567
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,750
This is impossible.

568
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,583
How can a character
from 1890s London

569
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,000
draw a picture
of the<i> Enterprise?</i>

570
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,333
Who's got control
of the computer?

571
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,625
He does-- Moriarty.

572
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,750
That is impossible.

573
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,083
I don't understand.

574
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,166
Nor do I.

575
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,208
Data, wait.
What about the doctor?

576
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:01,458
Is she all right in there?

577
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:04,375
No, she is
in grave danger.

578
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:16,792
Computer, why wasn't the
holodeck program terminated?

579
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:19,917
The override protocol
has been initiated.

580
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:21,291
On whose authority?

581
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:23,375
Lieutenant Geordi La Forge.

582
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:24,959
Me?

583
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,792
All right.

584
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:29,500
Tell me from the beginning
exactly what happened.

585
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,333
Well, Dr. Pulaski and I
had a discussion

586
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:35,000
about whether Data could solve
an original Holmes-type mystery.

587
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,834
Which you asked
the computer to provide.

588
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:39,417
Yes, with a worthy opponent.

589
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,709
Worthy of Holmes?

590
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:45,875
Oh, my God.

591
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,458
I asked...

592
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,834
I asked
for a Holmes-type mystery

593
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:52,041
with an opponent capable
of defeating Data.

594
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:54,375
That's got
to be it.

595
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:58,291
<i>Merde.</i>

596
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:05,250
Captain, I'm... I'm sorry.

597
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:09,083
I understand, Lieutenant.

598
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:13,709
Captain, this character
Moriarty--

599
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:15,333
he called for the arch.

600
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,625
He did what?

601
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:20,750
So... he has access
to the computer.

602
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,333
And perhaps our library files,
as well, sir.

603
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,625
That level
of information

604
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:26,458
would be necessary
in order to create

605
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:28,291
a true adversary
for me.

606
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:32,041
Theorize, Data.
What are his limits?

607
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:34,458
He is still a fictional
character, sir

608
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:37,792
originally programmed
with 19th century knowledge.

609
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:41,291
Which now has access
to 24th century knowledge.

610
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:44,000
What does he need
to make use of that?

611
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,375
Only time, sir.

612
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,166
WORF:
Sir.

613
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:49,834
I can lead a security team
to sweep the holodeck,

614
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:51,875
find the doctor,
and bring her out.

615
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,834
Captain, I believe that would
place the doctor at risk.

616
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:59,750
It is probable our mortality
fail-safe has been overridden.

617
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,500
Computer, where is Dr. Pulaski?

618
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,834
Dr. Pulaski is on holodeck two.

619
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:05,208
And her vital signs?

620
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:07,250
Strong and stable.

621
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,041
Captain, recommend we attempt

622
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,875
to destroy the hologram
generations themselves.

623
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,667
Is that possible, Geordi?

624
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,709
Using wave guides, I could split
a particle beam

625
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:19,166
out of the matter/antimatter
chamber and run it down

626
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,291
through existing conduit
into the holodeck.

627
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,417
If accelerated
to sufficient velocity

628
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:23,834
that would, quite literally,

629
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:26,291
wash away all present
holographic constructs--

630
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,792
the London buildings,
the streets, the people.

631
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:29,959
All gone.

632
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:32,417
Including Moriarty.

633
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:34,083
Dr. Pulaski?

634
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:37,750
Well, a particle beam will
tear apart human flesh as well.

635
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,166
Captain.

636
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,125
I'm sensing something
from the holodeck.

637
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:46,750
It's as if a unifying force,
or a single consciousness

638
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,375
is trying to bring it all
into focus.

639
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,000
There can be only
one explanation.

640
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,375
In programming Moriarty
to defeat me, not Holmes,

641
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:00,834
he had to be able to acquire
something which I possess.

642
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:02,583
What exactly?

643
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:04,000
Consciousness, sir.

644
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,750
Without it,
he could not defeat me.

645
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:13,875
Computer, what happened?

646
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:16,834
Attitude and stabilization
control of the<i> Enterprise</i>

647
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:20,750
was momentarily transferred
to holodeck two.

648
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,500
Data, I think it best
that you and I

649
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,792
should return
to the holodeck.

650
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,458
I will change
into my uniform, sir.

651
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:33,000
No, I will change
into some appropriate costume.

652
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,500
Our uniforms might pose
questions

653
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,917
which I'd rather he didn't ask.

654
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:40,375
It seems... that he feeds
on knowledge.

655
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:43,291
Well, let's not give
your nemesis

656
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:46,542
anymore information
than we have to.

657
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,917
How did you make
the room shake?

658
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:52,750
I'm not sure.

659
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,542
Now, dear lady, will that be
one lump or two?

660
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,333
Lumps, professor?

661
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:02,041
What sort of lumps?

662
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,750
Milk, of course?

663
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,625
Why not?

664
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:13,291
Mr. Computer proposes
the incredible thought

665
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,375
that we are all traveling

666
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:17,917
in a great vessel
of some sort.

667
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,750
Is that true?

668
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,792
I don't know what
you're talking about.

669
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:25,041
The scones are
likewise a must.

670
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:30,834
This is really quite
excellent.

671
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:32,875
Strange.

672
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:36,000
It actually pleases me
to hear you say that.

673
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,083
Very strange.

674
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,125
You know, you're beginning
to sound very different

675
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,917
from the Moriarty
I've read about.

676
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,333
You're not frightened of me?

677
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:49,083
No.

678
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:52,083
You should be.

679
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,917
Mr. Computer,
the arch please.

680
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,917
A few more questions,
Mr. Computer.

681
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,291
I just can't seem to remember
that last command.

682
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,542
Oh, well.

683
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:21,917
Sooner or later,
it'll all come to me.

684
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,875
But, in the meantime,

685
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,583
I have decided to approach
the problem

686
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,542
from a more familiar
perspective.

687
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,542
There's really no reason
why I shouldn't be able to use

688
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,750
some of the knowledge
from my world

689
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,625
to bring me closer to yours.

690
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:40,250
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

691
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,625
Of course you do, Madame.

692
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:43,291
The more you proclaim
your ignorance,

693
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:44,542
the more you try to mislead me,

694
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:45,750
the more I am onto you.

695
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,959
Your every silence
speaks volumes.

696
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,208
Good.

697
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,458
Then, if you know
what I'm saying

698
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:52,917
when I'm not saying anything,

699
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:55,709
what do you need me for?

700
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:58,959
Thank you for the tea
and crumpets.

701
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,792
I guess
I'll be going.

702
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,417
Where?

703
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,208
Back to here?

704
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,583
Yes.

705
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,834
Would you care to join me?

706
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,375
In time.

707
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:13,625
In time, I will
leave all of this

708
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,750
and join you out there.

709
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,291
Or is this where we
both are right now?

710
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,583
Right now, we are in London.

711
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:28,208
Tell me what you want from me
or allow me to leave.

712
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,917
Frankly, now,
I want nothing more

713
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:32,333
than what the fisherman
expects of the worm.

714
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,792
You, dear doctor,
will be the lure.

715
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,166
And this...

716
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:37,917
will be
the hook

717
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:40,917
for your captain,
Jean-Luc Picard.

718
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:43,792
Who is that?

719
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,583
How well you know.

720
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,917
Nice suit.

721
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:02,000
Thank you.

722
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,208
Captain, I will
be standing by

723
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,250
to assist you,
if needed.

724
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,583
You'll be a big hit
in London.

725
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,917
Computer, tell me, is
the program still running?

726
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:10,917
Affirmative.

727
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:12,208
You may enter.

728
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,583
Data, shall we go?

729
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:17,166
Gentlemen.

730
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,250
Open.

731
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,917
We don't have much time.

732
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:30,125
He's getting more control
of his environment.

733
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,834
Let's see if we can't beat
professor Moriarty

734
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:34,208
by giving him everything
he wants.

735
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,750
(<i> woman sobbing in distance</i> )

736
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:52,250
Obviously, he's trying
to alter the programming here.

737
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:57,125
Captain?

738
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,041
Tuppence.

739
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,750
Two pence.

740
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,208
It's supposed
to be good luck.

741
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:06,250
We may need some.

742
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,625
I'll take that coin, sir.

743
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,458
That's right,
and anymore you got, too.

744
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,000
Excuse me.

745
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,041
I don't think so.

746
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,917
I want all that money.

747
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:16,375
That's right--
I want it now.

748
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:17,417
Data.

749
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:25,083
This holographic image differs
from any I have ever seen.

750
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,500
Could he have
actually injured you?

751
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,417
It's more serious
than that.

752
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:32,375
I think the mortality
fail-safe may have
been circumvented.

753
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:34,166
He could have killed me.

754
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,542
(<i> gasping</i> ):
Let it go, Gov.

755
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:37,750
Come on, he's hurting me.

756
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,208
Data, let him go.

757
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,000
(<i> gasping</i> )

758
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,208
We will find Moriarty
this way, sir--

759
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:46,542
the warehouse.

760
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,583
(<i> bookcase creaking</i> )

761
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,917
Captain Picard.

762
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:16,291
You all right?

763
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:19,709
Yes, except for being
crammed full of crumpets.

764
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:22,583
I'm a civilized abductor,
Captain Picard.

765
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:26,834
Civilized, but still dangerous.

766
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:32,625
Bridge to holodeck control--
Worf.

767
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,917
Here, sir.

768
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:36,250
Status? Has anything changed?

769
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,875
No, sir.

770
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:46,458
Moriarty, you
were conjured up

771
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,792
in an attempt to
defeat Holmes here.

772
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:52,250
Once that attempt is
concluded-- win or lose--

773
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,709
your program has
run its course.

774
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:55,959
Your existence is done.

775
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:58,125
Congratulations, Professor.

776
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,375
I capitulate
to the better man.

777
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:02,041
Your victory, sir, is...

778
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:06,500
...is well earned.

779
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,917
It's gone beyond
that little game, Mr. Data.

780
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:12,166
And you'll note
I no longer call you "Holmes."

781
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,291
Whatever I was
when this began...

782
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:19,458
I have grown.

783
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:23,000
I am understanding
more and more...

784
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,500
and I am able to use
the power at my fingertips.

785
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:34,041
I can affect this vessel

786
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:37,125
and I can inflict
bodily harm on you

787
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:38,875
and on your doctor.

788
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:41,959
Yes, you can do that,
but you haven't.

789
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:44,750
I suspect you shook
this ship in order
to get my attention.

790
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,917
Well, now you have it.
What is it you want?

791
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:51,250
The same thing
you want for yourself--

792
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,083
to continue to exist.

793
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,917
If I destroy these
surroundings-- this vessel--

794
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,792
can you say that it
doesn't matter to you?

795
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:01,625
Interesting pun,
don't you think?

796
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:04,834
For matter is what I am not.

797
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:06,041
The computer has taught me

798
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,500
that I am made up
only of energy.

799
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,750
That may not be entirely
true, Professor.

800
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,125
This, which we
call the holodeck,

801
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:21,000
uses a principle similar
to another device

802
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,166
called a transporter.

803
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,291
(<i> sighs</i> )

804
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:30,959
In the year in which we
live, humans have discovered

805
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:33,917
that energy and matter
are interchangeable.

806
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:37,291
In the holodeck, energy
is converted into matter.

807
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,083
Thus, you have substance...

808
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,000
but only here.

809
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,959
And if I step off this holodeck?

810
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:46,792
PULASKI:
Then, Professor,

811
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:49,250
you will cease to exist.

812
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,041
PICARD:
You are not alive.

813
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:53,709
As I said before,
you are... only...

814
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:55,000
A holographic image.

815
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,375
I know.

816
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:58,834
But are you sure?

817
00:39:58,834 --> 00:39:59,959
Oh, yes.

818
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:04,625
Does he have life?

819
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:08,959
He's a machine...
but is that all he is?

820
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,917
No. He is more.

821
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:12,792
Exactly.

822
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:15,291
Is the definition of life
"cogito, ergo sum"--

823
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,625
"I think, therefore I am"?

824
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:20,125
Yes, that is one
possible definition.

825
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,792
It is the most
important one

826
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:26,166
and, for me,
the only one that matters.

827
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:28,875
You-- or someone--
asked your computer

828
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:30,875
to program
a nefarious fictional character

829
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,291
from 19th century London,
and that is how I arrived,

830
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,250
but I am no longer
that creation.

831
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,333
I am no longer
that evil character.

832
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,291
I have changed.

833
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,208
I am alive...

834
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:45,417
and I am aware
of my own consciousness.

835
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:49,750
Moriarty, my responsibility
is this vessel and its crew.

836
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,166
I want my existence.

837
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,375
I want it out there...

838
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:55,125
just as you have yours.

839
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,417
That may not be possible.

840
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:04,917
Then you must murder me,
Captain.

841
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:08,500
I cannot give you what you want.

842
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,166
Because you do not know

843
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:13,041
how to convert holodeck matter
into a more permanent form?

844
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:14,500
Yes, that is so.

845
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:20,542
A pity.

846
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:23,250
What I have seen...

847
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,083
what I have learned...

848
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,291
fascinates me.

849
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:33,208
I do not want to die.

850
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:36,208
And I do not want to kill you.

851
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:43,917
Madam, I have enjoyed
your company.

852
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,083
Computer... arch.

853
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:54,041
(<i> beeping</i> )

854
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,583
Cancel override protocol.

855
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:59,875
Return control
of the holodeck
to main computer.

856
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:05,333
My fate is in your hands...

857
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:07,667
as perhaps it always was.

858
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:09,500
Bridge, this
is the captain.

859
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,875
Commander Riker here, sir.

860
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:14,583
Number one, the situation
is under control.

861
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:15,834
Aye, sir.

862
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:23,083
Moriarty, this
vessel's computer

863
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,500
has a vast
memory capacity.

864
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,667
How well I know.

865
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:28,208
You will not be
extinguished.

866
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:31,583
We will save
this program,
and hopefully

867
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:34,083
in time, when
we know enough,

868
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:38,000
bring you back in
a form which could
leave the holodeck.

869
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:42,959
Then perhaps
we'll meet again, madam.

870
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,709
It could be a long time.

871
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:51,125
Time won't pass for you,
but I may be an old woman.

872
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:54,375
But I'll still fill you
with crumpets, madam.

873
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:00,583
I detest long good-byes.

874
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:04,083
You have the arch.

875
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:07,041
As you wish--
a short good-bye.

876
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:09,417
Computer, save
the program of the
character Moriarty

877
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:11,709
and then...

878
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:13,375
discontinue.

879
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:38,959
Damage?

880
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:40,917
Mm. Yes, sir.

881
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:43,125
She cracked a spar when
the<i> Enterprise</i> was shaken

882
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:47,542
but, otherwise, I think she
weathered it quite nicely.

883
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,542
She's beautiful.

884
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:52,000
A wonderful testimony
to simpler times.

885
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,375
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

886
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,834
It's just that...

887
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:58,291
I can't help
thinking how...

888
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:00,125
well, what else
might have happened,

889
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:02,417
all because I misspoke
a single word.

890
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:05,375
Well, soon she'll be shipshape
in Bristol fashion.

891
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:08,083
"Bristol fashion," sir?

892
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:09,834
It's an old navy phrase

893
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:12,500
meaning... "everything
in perfect order."

894
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,375
Hmm. Yes, sir.

895
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,417
As are we, Mr. La Forge.

896
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:20,792
Yes, sir.

897
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:23,333
RIKER:
Captain, starship<i> Victory</i> 
has arrived.

898
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:25,125
On my way, number one.
