<i>(shouting</i> )
Placing beam-out marker.

Return transport,
14 minutes, 40 seconds.

5
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,250
Is your view any better,
Geordi?

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,583
Not too bad, Commander.

7
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,500
A lot of charged
particle precipitation,

8
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:31,041
but I can compensate.

9
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,875
Communicators
are dysfunctional.

10
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:34,542
Tricorders?

11
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,959
Readings only found
within five meters.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,667
Good thing we didn't
bring Data.

13
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:42,125
We'd be unscrambling
his circuits for a week.

14
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:48,417
Commander, picking up something
on the positron scan.

16
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,959
GEORDI:
Over here.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Some electrically
conductive objects.

18
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,083
Recognize those
markings, Worf?

19
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes, sir.
Romulan.

20
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,583
What the hell
were they doing

21
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,417
in the Federation sector?

22
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:24,291
Picking up traces
of ultritium residue.

23
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,959
An explosive device
must've been used

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,041
to destroy the craft
after it crashed.

25
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,667
All right, let's spread
out, 25-meter radius.

26
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:36,333
Our window back
closes in 12 minutes.

27
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,792
Commander!

28
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,291
Commander Riker!

(<i> screaming</i> )

31
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,250
Four minutes
to beam-up.

32
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,583
Where is he?

33
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,291
Wait here.

34
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,792

Worf!

37
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,250
Worf!

38
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,542
Commander Riker!

39
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,041
RIKER:
Geordi!

40
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,500
Geordi!

41
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:10,208
Worf!

42
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,500
Commander Riker!

43
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:21,166
Hold your position,
Mr. Worf.

44
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,333
Worf!

45
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,333
(<i> sighs</i> )

46
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:05,000
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

47
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:09,083
<i>These are the voyages</i>

48
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,917
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,542
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

50
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:19,083

<i>and new civilizations,</i>

51

56
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,000
<i>a Federation planet.</i>

57
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,000
<i>We have recovered</i>
<i>one survivor.</i>

58
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,667
<i>But Lieutenant</i>
<i>Commander La Forge</i>

59
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:42,333
<i>did not report back</i>
<i>with the away team,</i>

60
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,291
<i>and is still missing.</i>

61
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,709
Get him to sick bay.

62
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,250
Secure sick bay,
post a guard

63
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,000
in visual contact
at all times.

64
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,625
He's not going anywhere,
Lieutenant.

65
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sorry, Commander,
there's just no way

66
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,208
to lock in on
anything down there.

67
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,083
Keep trying, O'Brien.

68
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,291
The electrical storm's
creating thousands of ghosts.

69
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,542
Well, beam some of
those ghosts back.

70
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,208
One of them may be Geordi.

71
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,792
Permission to lead
another away team, sir.

72
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,458
Denied.

73
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,375
When we get another
window in the storms.

74
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:12,792
The crash site?

75
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:15,000
The Romulan craft
is a total loss.

76
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,417
There's nothing
there to salvage.

77
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,166
Unless you wanna
use tweezers.

78
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,375
No sign of others?

79
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,834
Well, you couldn't
see more than two meters

80
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,792
in front of yourself
down there.

81
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,458
That certainly is
the last place

82
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,959
one would expect
Romulan encroachment.

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,709
On the other hand,
Galorndon Core

84
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,291
would provide ideal cover

85
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,625
for the opening move
of a new offensive.

86
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,625
I doubt if they were
there for the climate.

87
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,709
BEVERLY: We thought it would
be like working on Vulcans.

88
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,709
But there are subtle
differences, too many of them.

89
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,875
Can you treat him?

90
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:14,291
He has cell damage
to vital areas.

91
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,083
He's going to need a transfusion
of compatible ribosomes

92
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,792
in order to recover.

93
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,750
I'm setting up a schedule to
test every member of the crew.

94
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,208
We can't use
the replicator?

95
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,250
BEVERLY:
The molecules are too complex.

96
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,583
Will he survive?

97
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,375
I can't answer that yet.

98
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:31,041
Well, let me put it in
another way-- will he survive

99
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,959
long enough to tell us what
he was doing down there?

100
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,959
Doctor, it's an important
consideration.

101
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,792
I can bring him around
for a few minutes.

102
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:41,458
But there is one
serious complication.

103
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,917
His brain waves indicate early
neural pathway degeneration.

104
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,041
Head injury?

105
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,291
There's no obvious
cranial trauma.

106
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,583
I'm guessing his exposure
to the magnetic fields

107
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,917
on the surface
were slowly breaking down

108
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,834
his synaptic
connections.

109
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,083
Will that affect
Geordi the same way?

110
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:08,458
(<i> inhaling deeply</i> )

111
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
BEVERLY: He'll be conscious
for a minute or two.

112
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:20,083
RIKER: You are on board the
Federation Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

113
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,250
We're treating your injuries.

114
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,291
How long were you down
on Galorndon Core?

115
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:30,250
Do you understand me?

116
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:34,333
I will not answer questions.

117
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,750
We need to know if there are
other survivors on the surface.

118
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,417
I am alone.

119
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,125
I will not answer
any questions.

120
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,125
Do you have a mother ship
who should be advised

121
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,667
of your condition?

122
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,542
The only answer he wants to
give is that he was alone.

123
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,083
Which suggests
that he wasn't.

124
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,583
(<i> grunting</i> )

125
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,959
Something, anything
to cut through the storm,

126
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,917
some way to get a signal
through to him.

127
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,834
A neutrino pulse.

128
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,333
We could build a portable
neutrino source and send it

129
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,041
in a probe to the
planet's surface.

130
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,875
It'll act like a beacon.

131
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:11,250
DATA: A neutrino pulse would
send non-charged particles

132
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,667
back up through the atmosphere,

133
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:14,750
and would be detectable
by Geordi's visor.

134
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:17,417
He can show us that he's found
it by modifying the pulse.

135
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,375
Make it so.

136
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,542
Captain, I have
a new transmission

137
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,041
on a parallel frequency
to the distress call.

138
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,542
From the surface?

139
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,417
No, sir, from inside
the Romulan zone.

140
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,291
We should be able to
view the transmission.

141
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,709
On screen.

142
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,959
MALE VOICE:
Tomalak to Pi.

143
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,875
We have received your
distress signal.

144
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:43,917
Respond.

145
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:46,166
If you can hear me,

146
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,750
we are entering
the Neutral Zone now.

147
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:53,458
We will reach you in six hours.

148
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:07,667
Mr. Worf,
hail the Romulan vessel.

149
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:10,125
Hailing frequencies
open, sir.

150
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,333
Romulan vessel, this is
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

151
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,375
of the Federation
Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

152
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,875
The frequency<i> is</i> open, sir.

153
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:24,542
Commander Tomalak,

154
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,083
we have intercepted
your transmission.

155
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:31,792
You are<i> not</i> to enter
Federation space.

156
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:35,458
Captain Picard, my apologies.

157
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,375
Had I known you were
in this sector,

158
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,125
I certainly would have
advised you

159
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,458
before crossing
the Neutral Zone.

160
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,750
Indeed.

161
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:45,250
I'm sure you will
understand when I explain.

162
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,000
One of our ships had a slight
navigational error

163
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,792
and apparently crashed
on Galorndon Core.

164
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,250
A slight navigational error?

165
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,208
Nearly half a light year
past the Neutral Zone?

166
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:01,041
I assure you, Captain,
no aggression was intended.

167
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:06,500
Commander, we have recovered
one of your survivors.

168
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,959
He is on board your ship?

169
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,750
He is being treated
for severe injuries.

170
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,834
And his craft?

171
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,166
Destroyed,
deliberately...

172
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,000
after the crash.

173
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm sure you are prepared
to leave at once

174
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,208
and rendezvous
with me in the Neutral Zone.

175
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,458
I have an away team
on the planet.

176
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,083
We are waiting for a window
in the storm to beam them up.

177
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,959
And then you will return
my officer?

178
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,125
Are there any other Romulans

179
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,208
we should be looking to
recover from Galorndon Core?

180
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:43,792
No, it was a one-man craft.

181
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:46,792
Captain, we will be
at the Federation border

182
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,875
of the Neutral Zone in
roughly five hours.

183
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:52,458
We will expect you to
rendezvous at that time.

184
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,625
Counselor?

185
00:14:56,667 --> 00:15:00,041
There's great hostility
behind his smile.

186
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,500
He'll stop at nothing
to complete his mission.

187
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,667
Including the Neutral Zone
border.

188
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:08,834
Captain, I see no reason to
return the Romulan to his ship.

189
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,667
He should be held
and interrogated.

190
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,250
We have every right
to detain him, sir.

191
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,375
Without evidence of
intent, Number One,

192
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:17,083
it will not be
a simple matter.

193
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,375
It obviously wasn't
pilot's error.

194
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,291
I think it demands
a response from us.

195
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,208
But we must measure
our response carefully,

196
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,041
or history may remember
Galorndon Core

197
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:32,250
along with Pearl Harbor
and Station Salem-One

198
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:36,166
as the stage for a
bloody preamble to war.

199
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,458
I want him off all the drugs.
They're not doing anything.

200
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,834
Dr. Crusher to Picard.

201
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,208
PICARD:
Go ahead, doctor.

202
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,166
My patient is not responding
to treatment.

203
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,750
You haven't found
a compatible ribosome donor?

204
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,333
BEVERLY: The lab is still
processing the tests.

205
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,041
Early results indicate humans

206
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,458
have far too many
bio-rejection factors.

207
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,834
I've also ruled out the
Vulcans we've tested.

208
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,208
I think I'll try a little
old-fashioned country medicine,

209
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,583
keep the fever down, try to
let the body heal itself.

210
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,041
Keep me advised.
Picard out.

211
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,917
Captain, the neutrino
beacon is operational

212
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:19,583
and we've placed it
aboard a class 3 probe.

213
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,667
Well done, Ensign.
Mr. Worf, launch the probe.

214
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:25,041
Aye, aye, sir.

215
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,041
(<i> howling winds and thunder</i> )

216
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,625
(<i> grunting</i> )

217
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,709
(<i> yelling</i> )

218
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,125
(<i> beeping</i> )

219
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,417
Probe has reached
the surface, sir.

220
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,125
The neutrino stream
is coming in strongly.

221
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,667
Sensors are tracking the probe
despite the interference.

222
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,458
(<i> panting</i> )

223
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:48,709
LA FORGE: A stationary
neutrino source.

224
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,834
Wesley Crusher.

225
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,709
Thank you, Wesley.

226
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,500
(<i> grunts</i> )

227
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,583
You are my prisoner!

228
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,000
Right.
Congratulations.

229
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,208
Surely a strategic triumph
for the Romulan empire.

230
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,834
Stay there!

231
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,041
Shoes are getting
full of sand.

232
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,750
I just hate that,
don't you?

233
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:52,458
Name and rank.

234
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,458
Lieutenant Commander
Geordi La Forge.

235
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't think I got yours.

236
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,834
A Romulan ship
will arrive shortly.

237
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,667
You will accompany me
on board.

238
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,125
I don't think so.

239
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,792
See, we heard your message,
too, and, well...

240
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:09,792
the fleet's in, Commodore.

241
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:12,041
Sky is full of
Federation ships.

242
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,625
You're lying.

243
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:18,125
I never lie when I've got sand
in my shoes, Commodore.

244
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,792
Get up.

245
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,000
Seriously...

246
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,000
the only way out of here

247
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,625
is for you to put
that thing down,

248
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,959
and soon as there's
a window in the storm...

249
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,083
(<i> coughing</i> )

250
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,875
GEORDI:
You okay?

251
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,208
(<i> coughing</i> )

252
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:20,709
You gotta be kidding.

253
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,417
Sit.

254
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,000
Welcome to Galorndon Core,

255
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:36,333
where no good deed
goes unpunished.

256
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,125
Yes, Doctor?

257
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,875
Lieutenant, good.

258
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:52,208
Come in.
Please, sit down.

259
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,166
We have finally found a
compatible ribosome match

260
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,583
for the Romulan,
but only one.

261
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,959
You.

262
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,667
That is impossible.
I am a Klingon.

263
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:10,834
Different species, yes.

264
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,875
But many humanoids have
comparable cell structures,

265
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:17,041
and you have what
this Romulan needs.

266
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,542
There's absolutely
no risk to you.

267
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,583
You did understand
that was the purpose

268
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,709
of all the testing?

269
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,000
I have no objection
to tests.

270
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,667
You have an objection
to being a donor.

271
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:39,125
Yes.

272
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:45,750
Lieutenant, I understand your
feelings about the Romulans,

273
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,000
but this is not the
time or the place--

274
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,792
If you had seen them
kill your parents,

275
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:52,709
you would understand, Doctor.

276
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,500
It is always the time and place
for those feelings.

277
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:59,125
<i>This</i> Romulan didn't murder
your parents,

278
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,834
and you are the only one
who can save his life.

279
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,917
Then he will die.

280
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,041
I sure wish you'd
put that away.

281
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,500
You're afraid of dying?

282
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:20,125
You bet I am.

283
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,709
Who isn't?
I'm not.

284
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,083
(<i> scoffs</i> )
Right.

285
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,000
To die in the service
of my people...?

286
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,500
Oh, the Romulan
path to glory.

287
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:30,750
You can be sarcastic now.

288
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:33,583
But in a few millennia,
when humans are extinct

289
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:37,542
and the Romulan empire
spans the galaxy...

290
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,333
You really believe that stuff,
don't you, Commodore?

291
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:45,709
You may address me
as Centurion Bochra.

292
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,250
Bochra.

293
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:51,458
Good, solid Romulan name.

294
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,166
(<i> coughing</i> )

295
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,041
What's the matter?

296
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,250
Nothing.
Wrong.

297
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,542
Your heart rate
just shot way up.

298
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:09,625
It translates a wide range of
radiation into neural impulses.

299
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,083
Allows me to see.

300
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:16,250
Without it, you're blind?

301
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,625
Yeah.

302
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,542
How did this happen?

303
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,041
(<i> sighs</i> )
I was born that way.

304
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,875
And your parents let you live?

305
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:28,583
What kind of
question is that?

306
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,583
Of course, they let me live.

307
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,417
No wonder
your race is weak.

308
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:37,083
You waste time and resources
on defective children.

309
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,417
Whoa.

310
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:52,125
Must be having some sort
of polarity shift.

311
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,542
The diagnostic insists
everything's fine.

312
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,333
(<i> coughs</i> )

313
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,875
Hey.

314
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:07,583
Hey, your body temperature
has gone up

315
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,291
almost another full point.

316
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,792
What are you saying?

317
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:14,667
I don't know, I...
It-- it must be this place.

318
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:17,083
It's all that
electromagnetic soup.

319
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,542
It's wreaking havoc on
our nervous systems.

320
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,125
Your metabolism's
messed up.

321
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:24,083
So is my interface
with the visor.

322
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,458
We gotta get out of here
while we still can--

323
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,917
Sit down!
Bochra...

324
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,417
Sit down!

325
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,000
(<i> sighs</i> )

326
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,083
(<i> coughing</i> )

327
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,291
What is that?

328
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,083
It's just a background
fluctuation, Commander.

329
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,667
He hasn't found it yet.

330
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:54,959
Then he must be
hurt... or dead.

331
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:00,709
When does our next
window open up, Mr. Data?

332
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,625
There's no indication,
Commander.

333
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,959
I have no way to predict.

334
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,959
Incoming Romulan
transmission, Captain.

335
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,333
They're early.

336
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,000
DATA: The Romulan
Warbird should still be

337
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,291
29 minutes away from the
edge of the Neutral Zone.

338
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:16,333
Close enough, however,
to see that we're not there.

339
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:19,709
(<i> sighs</i> )
On screen.

340
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,834
Picard, I'm approaching
the Federation border

341
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,959
and the<i> Enterprise</i>
is not to be found.

342
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,417
Why?

343
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,208
My away team is unable
to leave the surface

344
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,375
because of the storms.

345
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:34,083
TOMALAK:
And my officer?

346
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,417
He is alive.

347
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:38,333
His life remains in jeopardy?

348
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:40,834
Yes.

349
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,875
And yet you will
<i>still</i> not permit me

350
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,375
to cross into your precious
Federation space

351
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:47,083
to retrieve him?

352
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:49,709
If the point has not yet been
made clearly, Commander,

353
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,208
let me make it again.

354
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,208
Romulan warships
do not enter Federation space

355
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,208
unless they are prepared
to do battle.

356
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,875
But a mission of mercy?

357
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:02,625
A mission to recover one
of your officers

358
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:06,333
who has been caught
on a Federation planet...

359
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,917
for reasons as yet unknown.

360
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,041
TOMALAK:
I have already explained.

361
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:12,166
And I have rejected
your explanation!

362
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,750
Territories.

363
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:19,542
You would
measure territories

364
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:22,959
against a man's life?

365
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,542
Commander, I am
singularly impressed

366
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,750
by your concern
for<i> a</i> life.

367
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:30,166
Do not risk any more lives
by leaving the Neutral Zone.

368
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,458
Picard out.

369
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:43,208
Bochra.

370
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,875
Bochra, you're in bad shape.
And my vision's getting worse.

371
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:48,583
Now, there's a beacon
out there

372
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:49,834
that'll get us
back to my ship.

373
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,625
But<i> not</i> if I can't
find it.

374
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:54,166
I cannot surrender
to the Federation.

375
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:56,250
Then stay here and die.

376
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:01,333
If the situation were reversed,

377
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:04,208
would you not die
to avoid capture?

378
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,583
I don't know.

379
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:09,083
I might,<i> if</i> I thought
it was necessary,

380
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,417
if the stakes were high enough.

381
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:13,083
But they'd have to be
pretty damned high.

382
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:15,709
(<i> scoffs</i> )

383
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,375
I guess I'd make a pretty
lousy Romulan, huh?

384
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:20,709
(<i> chuckles</i> )

385
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,875
I no more wish to
die than you do.

386
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:26,542
Bochra...

387
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:29,333
there are times
when it's necessary

388
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:32,291
to die for one's ideals.

389
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:37,125
Do you believe
this is one of those times?

390
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,041
Come on.
Let's go find that beacon.

391
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,125
Whoa.

392
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,291
What is it?

393
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,417
Everything's gone blank.

394
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm blind.

395
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:26,125
(<i> door chimes</i> )

396
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,792
Come.

397
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,500
Worf.

398
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:39,709
You are busy.
Forgive my intrusion.

399
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,500
For what it's worth,

400
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:43,542
I understand
your bitterness.

401
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:46,750
With respect, sir,
you cannot.

402
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:51,458
I am asked to give up the
very lifeblood of my mother

403
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,375
<i>and</i> my father to those
who murdered them.

404
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:55,583
So, you blame all
Romulans for that?

405
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,709
Yes.
Forever?

406
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,375
What if someday, the Federation
made peace with the Romulans?

407
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:07,166
Impossible.

408
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:10,917
That's what your people said
a few years ago about humans.

409
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:16,291
Think how many died
on both sides in that war.

410
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,959
Would you and I be
here now, like this,

411
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,041
if we hadn't been able to let
go of the anger and the blame?

412
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,417
Where does it end, Worf?

413
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:29,709
If that Romulan dies,
does his family

414
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,291
carry the bitterness
on another generation?

415
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,667
Then<i> you</i> believe I should.

416
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:43,875
What I believe
doesn't matter.

417
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:48,166
My Starfleet training
tells me one thing.

418
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:51,041
But everything
I am tells me another.

419
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,500
BEVERLY: Lieutenant Worf,
report to sick bay.

420
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,375
Acknowledged.

421
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,709
(<i> shivering</i> )

422
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:20,667
Lieutenant, his life
is coming to an end.

423
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:24,417
I thought it important
for you to see him again.

424
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:27,625
It's not too late to
change your mind.

425
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,500
Come close to me, Klingon.

426
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:49,792
Let me die with my hands
at your throat.

427
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:52,750
There is a substance
within my cells

428
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:54,625
which you need to survive.

429
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:01,625
Then you've come to hear me
beg for my life.

430
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:04,208
No.

431
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,667
I would rather die

432
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:17,375
than pollute my body
with Klingon filth.

433
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:35,041
I've lost almost all
feeling in my legs.

434
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,750
My synapses must be
turning to jelly.

435
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:41,458
The visor's fine,
I just can't see a thing.

436
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,333
How do we locate
the beacon?

437
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,458
We don't.

438
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:57,417
Do all humans
give up so easily?

439
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,000
Bochra, we're lost.

440
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:02,792
Unless you've got something
that can smell neutrinos.

441
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,583
We have the sensor device
you're carrying.

442
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,834
Tricorder.

443
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:13,208
It's not set up
to detect neutrinos.

444
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,500
Your eye device does.
Connect them.

445
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:19,166
That's crazy, they don't
speak the same language.

446
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:22,917
Besides, I'd never be able
to get an accurate sampling.

447
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:24,917
Wait a second.

448
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,375
Wait, I wouldn't need
an accurate sampling,

449
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:31,208
just a-- a pointer.

450
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,709
A neutrino Geiger counter.

451
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:38,834
(<i> sighs</i> )
It's still not possible.

452
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,083
You cannot do it.

453
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,208
Under normal circumstances,
maybe.

454
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,500
Here, no way.

455
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:45,667
Why?

456
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:48,583
Because I can't see!

457
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,500
Adapting the neural output pods
of the visor is tricky work.

458
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:56,166
It can't be done by touch.

459
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:05,291
Then I will be your eyes.

460
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,125
The storm is beginning
to subside, Captain.

461
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:16,834
We should have a window
in less than an hour.

462
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:20,250
There's still no indication
that he's found the beacon, sir.

463
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,667
Assemble an away team.
Yes, sir.

464
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,875
Captain, the Romulan warship has
crossed the Neutral Zone border.

465
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:29,542
It is in Federation space,
and heading towards us.

466
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:31,750
Belay that order,
Number One.

467
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,959
Red alert.

468
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,667

470

matches the visor
output range.

00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:47,917
BOCHRA:
Not so fast.

472
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:52,417
Now, place the
neural output pods

473
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:55,500
in contact with the tricorder
scanner heads.

474
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,917
Ready.

475
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,625
Let her rip.

<i>( laughing</i> )
We did it!

479
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:15,125
The first Federation-Romulan
co-venture.

480
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,208
The storm may be breaking.

481
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,291
With any luck, there'll be
an electromagnetic window

482
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,750
opening up, and we
can get out of here.

483
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:27,208
At which point,
I'll be your prisoner.

484
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:32,667
Can you walk?

485
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:34,417
I don't know.

486
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,750
Well, let's find out.

487
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,792
Come on.

488
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,083
Okay, let's go.

489
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,458
Straight ahead.
Okay.

490
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:54,333
To the right.

491
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:56,959
(<i> door chimes</i> )

492
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,625
Come.

493
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,041
You wish to see me, Captain?

494
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,125
Yes, Lieutenant.

495
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,458
I assume you know
what it's about.

496
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,959
Yes.

497
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,625
The Romulan vessel
will reach us within the hour.

498
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:18,375
If our patient dies,

499
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:22,291
it may be just the excuse
the Romulan Commander needs

500
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,959
to start an incident.

501
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,959
The death of a Romulan officer
at the hands of the Federation.

502
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,250
Think of it.

503
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,417
I have, Captain.

504
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:37,875
So, there is no question
that the Romulan officer

505
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:41,583
is more valuable to us
alive than dead.

506
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,792
I understand.

507
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,750
Lieutenant...

508
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:55,166
sometimes the moral
obligations of command

509
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,917
are less than clear.

510
00:35:56,959 --> 00:36:00,000
I have to weigh the
good of the many

511
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:02,375
against the needs
of the individual,

512
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:06,583
and try to balance them as
realistically as possible.

513
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,083
God knows, I don't
always succeed.

514
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,333
I have not had cause
to complain, Captain.

515
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:14,667
Oh, Lieutenant,
you wouldn't complain

516
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:17,458
even if you had cause.

517
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,375
If you order me to agree
to the transfusion,

518
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,333
I will obey, of course.

519
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:30,583
I don't want to
order you...

520
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:32,417
but I ask you.

521
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:37,250
I... beg you...

522
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:39,208
to volunteer.

523
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,166
I cannot.

524
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:53,625
Lieutenant?

525
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,250
Sir?

526
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,750
That will be all.

527
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:10,583
Picard to Dr. Crusher.

Go ahead.

Do not continue to enlist
the cooperation

00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,834
of Lieutenant Worf.

531
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:19,583
I won't have to,
Captain.

532
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,750
The Romulan has died.

alter its signal pattern

536
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,250
so the<i> Enterprise</i> knows
we've found it.

537
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:48,625
Will that
be difficult?

538
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:51,375
No!
Not with your help.

539
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:58,333
Scanners are showing
a window, Captain.

540
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,834
Expected duration?

541
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:02,041
Nine minutes,
40 seconds, sir.

542
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,709
No change in the neutrino
beacon signal, sir.

543
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,125
Romulan ship
approaching.

544
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,458
Bearing 3-54,
mark 2-8-7.

545
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,375
On screen.

546
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,208
WORF:
Entering phaser range.

547
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,333
We are being hailed, sir.

548
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:21,041
On viewer.

549
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:27,041
You have one chance to
escape destruction, Picard.

550
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:30,458
Return my officer at once.

551
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,709
Commander, you have entered
Federation space

552
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,959
despite my warning.

553
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,959
<i>You</i> forced the situation!

554
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,083
I will not leave
without him.

555
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:44,542
He's dead.

556
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:52,959
Then he is but the first
to fall, Picard.

557
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,291
The Romulan ship
is routing power

558
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,834
to its forward
disruptor array.

559
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:00,583
All shields to maximum.

560
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,458
Aye, sir.

561
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,417
Lock phasers on target.

562
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:07,792
WORF:
Phasers locked and ready.

563
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:10,166
Captain, the signal pattern
from the beacon is modulating.

564
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:11,959
It's Geordi.

565
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,875
We can't transport him
with the shields up.

566
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:16,458
If we lower our shields,
the Romulan<i> will</i> strike.

567
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,583
The electromagnetic window
on the planet is closing, sir.

568
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,000
Three minutes remain.

569
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,709
Transporter room,
lock onto

570
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,625
the neutrino beam
and stand by.

571
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:26,375
O'BRIEN:
Standing by, Captain.

572
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,917
The window is allowing
intermittent sensor readings.

573
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,500
There's still numerous
ghost images,

574
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,125
but I believe
we are picking up

575
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:34,041
two life-forms near
the beacon.

576
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,291
Another Romulan?

577
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,083
I cannot say.

578
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:42,417
The electromagnetic interference
prevents an accurate reading.

579
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:45,125
But that's a likely
hypothesis, Number One.

580
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:48,875
If Commander La Forge has
located a second survivor...

581
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:52,375
Lieutenant,
hail the Romulan vessel.

582
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:54,041
Aye, sir.

583
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,583
They are ignoring our hail.

584
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,375
Repeat the hail,
all channels.

585
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:00,917
You say they have
no way of knowing

586
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:03,000
how accurate
our sensors are?

587
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:07,583
Put on your best
poker face, Number One.

588
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,750
Open a frequency.

589
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:12,125
Commander Tomalak.

590
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,709
It would appear our away team

591
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:18,709
has located a<i> second</i> man
from your<i> one-man</i> ship.

592
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,834
We're preparing to beam them
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

593
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:25,500
After which, of course, we will
return the survivor to you.

594
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:28,792
No acknowledgement, sir.

595
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:35,417
Commander, both our ships
are ready to fight.

596
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:38,667
We have two extremely powerful

597
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:42,458
and destructive arsenals
at our command.

598
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,625
Our next actions will
have serious repercussions.

599
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,417
We have good reason to
mistrust one another,

600
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:53,417
but we have even better reason
to set those differences aside.

601
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:58,166
Now, of course, the question is:
who will take the initiative?

602
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:03,917
Who will make the first
gesture of trust?

603
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,542
The answer is, I will.

604
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:16,458
I must lower our shields
to beam those men up

605
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,709
from the planet surface.

606
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:26,375
Once the shields are down

607
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,792
you will, of course, have
the opportunity to fire on us.

608
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:31,583
If you do,
you will destroy

609
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:34,208
not only the<i> Enterprise</i>
and its crew,

610
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,959
but the cease-fire

611
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,417
that the Romulans
and the Federation now enjoy.

612
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,667
Lieutenant, lower the shields.

613
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:48,959
Leave the hailing frequency
open.

614
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:53,125
Yes, sir.

615
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:55,417
WORF:
Shields down.

616
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:57,959
Mr. O'Brien,
transport Commander La Forge

617
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,625
and the Romulan directly
to the bridge.

618
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:02,000
O'BRIEN:
Aye, sir. Energizing.

619
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,792
Security team
to the bridge.

620
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:12,125
Belay that order,
Lieutenant. Shields up.

621
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:19,542
No one is gonna harm you.

622
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:22,583
You have<i> my</i> word on that.

623
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,834
Well, Commander?

624
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:33,834
If he has been
in any way mistreated...

625
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:41,125
I have given them
no information, Commander,

626
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:44,500
but I have not
been mistreated.

627
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:50,333
In fact, this human
saved my life.

628
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:54,792
Tomalak, how is it possible

629
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:56,959
that you didn't know
of the second Romulan

630
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,041
on Galorndon Core?

631
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:03,250
A simple misunderstaing,
Captain Picard.

632
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:07,917
I was obviously misinformed
as to the size of the craft.

633
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:11,041
I assure you,
I intended no deception.

634
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:13,542
Of course not.

635
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:16,250
You doubt my good faith?

636
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:18,500
Let's just say my faith
would be strengthened

637
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:20,333
by a gesture from you--

638
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:23,333
such as powering down
your disruptors.

639
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:28,917
Disruptors powering down.

640
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:30,375
Thank you.

641
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:33,792
Cancel red alert,
Lieutenant.

642
00:43:33,834 --> 00:43:36,125
Commander, we shall
return your officer

643
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:38,208
and escort your ship
to the Neutral Zone.

644
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,542
That is acceptable.

645
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,333
It's good to have
you back, Commander.

646
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,917
It's good to be back, sir.

647
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,125
Actually, I have
Centurion Bochra

648
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:51,667
to thank for it.

649
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,166
Indeed.

650
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,917
Commander La Forge
<i>and</i> Lieutenant Worf,

651
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:05,959
escort our guest to
Transporter Room One.

652
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,625
Yes, sir.

653
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,083
Come on.

654
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:14,917
Close call.

655
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:17,709
Too close, Number One.

656
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,959
Brinkmanship is
a dangerous game.
