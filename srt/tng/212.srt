00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:06,417
PICARD:
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42625.4.</i>

2
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,750
<i>We are entering orbit</i>
<i>around the eighth planet</i>

3
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:13,083
<i>in this previously unmapped</i>
<i>Theta 116 solar system.</i>

4
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,291
<i>We diverted from our</i>
<i>scheduled course</i>

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,208
<i>when a passing Klingon cruiser</i>

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,083
<i>reported discovering</i>
<i>pieces of a strange vessel</i>

7
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:23,041
<i>in the upper atmosphere</i>
<i>of this planet.</i>

8
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,166
<i>We have come to investigate.</i>

9
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,625
Nasty.

10
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:30,083
Nitrogen, methane,
liquid neon.

11
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:33,917
Surface temperature,
-291 degrees Celsius.

12
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:38,208
Winds up to 312 meters
per second.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,625
Not exactly a
vacation planet, huh?

14
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:44,417
Mm-mm, not unless you
like ammonia tornados.

15
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,250
But I have found
indications of debris

16
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,959
in an elliptical orbit.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,625
RIKER:
You keep me informed.

18
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,875
The sooner we find out what
the Klingons think they saw,

19
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:53,583
the sooner we can get
the hell out of here.

20
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,583
Sounds good to me.

21
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,417
(<i> shivers</i> )
Nasty.

22
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,834
(<i> door chimes</i> )

23
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,500
Come.

24
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,291
Fermat's last theorem.

25
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,959
You're familiar
with it?

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,333
Vaguely.

27
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,750
I spent too many
math classes

28
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,542
daydreaming about
being on a starship.

29
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,083
Mmm.

30
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,000
When Pierre de Fermat died,
they found this equation

31
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,250
scrawled in the margin
of his notes--

32
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,125
"X to the nth plus Y to
the nth equals Z to the nth

33
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,667
where N is greater
than two,"

34
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:30,083
which he said had no
solution in whole numbers.

35
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:35,500
But, he also added this
phrase, "remarkable proof."

36
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, that's starting
to come back to me.

37
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,458
There was no proof included.

38
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,792
Mm-hmm, and for
800 years,

39
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,500
people have been
trying to solve it.

40
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:43,792
Including you.

41
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:45,417
I find it stimulating.

42
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,291
Also, it puts things
in perspective.

43
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:51,959
In our arrogance,
we feel we are so advanced.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And yet, we cannot
unravel a simple knot

45
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,834
tied by a part-time
French mathematician

46
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:02,041
working alone
without a computer.

47
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,250
Captain, we've detected some
sort of debris in loose orbit.

48
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,000
Can you identify it?
No, sir.

49
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,417
I suggest we beam a section
aboard for analysis.

50
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,458
Make it so, Number One.

51
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,041
We've locked onto something
with markings on it.

52
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,041
What sort
of markings?

53
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,959
Uncertain.
Energize.

54
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,125
We've got ourselves
a little puzzle, Number One.

55
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,542
Yes, sir,
I guess we have.

56
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:28,750
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

57
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,792
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

58
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:34,542
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

59
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:38,709
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

60
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,208
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

61
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,458
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

62
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,125
Analysis bears out
that the object

63
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,917
was definitely
terrestrial in origin

64
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,667
dated mid-21st century.

65
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:56,208
No, no.
No Earth ship of that time

66
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,291
could have traveled
out this far.

67
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,709
Nevertheless, that is
what our tests indicate.

68
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,750
And the markings we
discovered are consistent

69
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:04,250
with this hypothesis.

70
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,000
Any indication
of what destroyed it, Data?

71
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,834
That is even
more significant

72
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,750
than the object itself,
Counselor.

73
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,291
On several of
its surfaces,

74
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,333
the molecules seem to
have disintegrated.

75
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,375
Disintegrated how?

76
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:20,458
Almost as if they were hit
by a weapon from our time.

77
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,375
Curiouser
and curiouser.

78
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,000
WESLEY:
Captain, we've detected

79
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,417
a large structure
on the planet.

80
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,750
WESLEY:
It's a building of some sort,

81
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,417
situated on a plane
of frozen methane

82
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,333
smack in the middle of a
tremendous storm belt.

83
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,750
I don't believe this.

84
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:41,709
That structure is surrounded
with breathable air.

85
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,667
Is there any connection
between that structure

86
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,291
and the ship fragment
that we found?

87
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,750
Unknown, sir.

88
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,417
Suggestions?

89
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,041
Well just one, sir-- we can go
down there and have a look.

90
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,375
Breathable air.

91
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,500
No life forms that
might be dangerous.

92
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,000
I think we could risk

93
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,125
a minimal away team,
Number One.

94
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:02,375
Give me a moment, gents,
we're dealing with

95
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:04,792
an extremely
narrow access point.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,083
Phasers on stun.

97
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,417
Ready when you are.

98
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,291
I believe we've got it now.

99
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,875
You have a green light,
Commander.

100
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,166
Energize.

101
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:38,542
Those ammonia storms are less
than a kilometer away.

102
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:42,000
Yet they do not appear to
penetrate this breathable zone.

103
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,667
It's like the eye
of a hurricane.

104
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:47,291
Commander, what is that?

105
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,583
A door.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,291
The structure must be here,
yet we cannot see it.

107
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:09,667
Enterprise,
this is Commander Riker.

108
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,917
As your readout shows,
this is an unusual place.

109
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,750
Completely calm, no sound,
no movement,

110
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:20,166
yet a few hundred meters away,
a storm is raging.

111
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,291
PICARD: Any information
about the structure?

112
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,875
Yes, sir, there's an
antique revolving door.

113
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:26,166
It could be an entrance.

114
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,542
Revolving door?

115
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,792
Number One,
proceed with caution.

116
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,625
RIKER:
Yes, sir.

117
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,333
Well, this is what
we came here for.

118
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,875
Captain, we're entering.

119
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:52,792
(<i> conversational chatter</i>
<i>and slot machines ringing</i> )

120
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,041
<i>Enterprise</i> to away team,
come in.

121
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,166
We're receiving no signal
at all from them, sir.

122
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,333
Transporter room,
lock on to the landing party,

123
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,125
beam them up.

124
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,709
We've got nothing
to lock on to, sir.

125
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,166
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

126
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,166
We've entered
the structure.

127
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,959
Riker to<i> Enterprise,</i> 
come in.

128
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,542
Come in,<i> Enterprise.</i>

129
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,834
When they went through
that antique doorway,

130
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,792
their signal just
disappeared, sir.

131
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,333
What's causing
the interference?

132
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,542
Unknown.

133
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,000
They're receiving us?

134
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,583
No.

135
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,375
We're going to have to
recalibrate all the frequencies

136
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,959
to find one that'll work.

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,875
Then do it.

138
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:15,000
Sir, without communication,
we should beam up immediately.

139
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,333
We're here.
There's no danger.

140
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,250
We'll look around,
then leave.

141
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,458
Checking in, gentlemen?

142
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,792
You'll have to go
to the front desk.

143
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:25,583
Very good.
We'll start with that.

144
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,500
(<i> clears throat</i> )

145
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,000
Welcome, gentlemen.

146
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,500
Have a nice trip?

147
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,500
Do you know us?

148
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:53,291
We've been expecting you.

149
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,417
A trio of
foreign gentlemen.

150
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,250
Yes, we're from the United
Federation of Planets.

151
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,583
Of course you are.

152
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,709
Welcome to the Hotel Royale.

153
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,917
Excuse me.
Did Rita call?

154
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,291
I'm busy.

155
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,667
You're busy?

156
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,792
This is my life
I'm talking about here.

157
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:18,375
Now, did Rita call
or not?

158
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,709
No, and for your own good,

159
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,959
you better quit
thinking about Rita.

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,625
I'm not afraid
of Mickey D.

161
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,041
Then you're a fool.

162
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,125
Anybody with any sense
is afraid of Mickey D.

163
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,041
If Rita calls,
you let me know.

164
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,291
Kid's just asking
for trouble.

165
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,959
Rita's too much
for him to handle,

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,917
and Mickey D's gonna plant
his face in the pavement.

167
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:52,542
Now, here are your room keys.

168
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:01,834
And some complimentary
casino chips.

169
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,041
Enjoy.

170
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,875
What is this place?

171
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:18,500
How did a being
like you get here?

172
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,792
Well, this is the Royale,
of course.

173
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,166
And my personal life is really

174
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,750
none of your business,
thank you.

175
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,917
What he means is
what planet is this?

176
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,208
I beg your pardon?

177
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,250
This planet--
what do you call it?

178
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,750
Earth.

179
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,667
What do you call it?

180
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,917
We call it Theta Eight.

181
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,667
How charming.

182
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,667
Commander?

183
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:06,083
Yes, Data?

184
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,875
None of these people
are emitting life signs.

185
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:14,291
You mean,
they're not alive?

186
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,500
Then what are they?

187
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:20,625
(<i> overlapping chatter</i> )

188
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,834
These beings--
are they machines,

189
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,041
or mere illusions
designed to deceive us?

190
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,208
Not illusion, Lieutenant.
They do exist.

191
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,291
But they do not register
as either man or machine.

192
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,959
Take this creature,
for example.

193
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,834
He does not exhibit
any DNA structure.

194
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,625
Excuse me, son.

195
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,208
Look who's talking.

196
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,250
Man, you sound just like
my ex-wife.

197
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,417
All right.

198
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,291
Time to get down
to "bidness."

199
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,625
What sort of "bidness"

200
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:07,000
do you suppose he is
getting down to?

201
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:19,417
Status report.

202
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,291
We're attempting to employ
alternate encoding schemes.

203
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,291
There could be hundreds
of possible combinations.

204
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,500
Is there an intelligence
causing this interference?

205
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:31,834
Mmm.

206
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,709
No, that's impossible
to tell, Captain.

207
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:51,709
It's unlike Commander Riker
not to follow procedure.

208
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,417
When he lost contact
with the<i> Enterprise</i>

209
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,834
he should have
returned immediately

210
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,917
to the beam-down
coordinates.

211
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,959
I don't feel he's
in any danger.

212
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,500
In fact, if I could choose
one word to assess his mood,

213
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,583
it would be amused.

214
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:09,291
"Amused?"

215
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

216
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,709
What about some chips there,
mister?

217
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,709
Yessiree!
(<i> laughing</i> )

218
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,667
Oh.

219
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,083
You're new around
here, aren't you?

220
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,709
Yes, sir.
Then sit down.

221
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,208
I'm gonna teach you how
this game is played, boy.

222
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,250
(<i> laughing</i> )

223
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,625
Go ahead, ante up.

224
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,083
(<i> inhales deeply</i> )
I'll be.

225
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,834
He wants you
to cut the cards.

226
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,750
Ah!
Is this poker?

227
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,166
No, no. Blackjack.

228
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,709
Blackjack.

229
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,250
Accessing.

230
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:48,542
Ah, also known as "21."

231
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,875
A number which defines
the object of the game.

232
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:53,000
Picture cards
are worth ten,

233
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,667
aces, one or 11,

234
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:57,333
all other cards,
face value.

235
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,041
Boy, you're right.

236
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,750
You are right.

237
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,458
(<i> whistles</i> )

238
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,875
MAN:
Pretty smooth.

239
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,792
Run 'em, boy.

240
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:11,083
Make 'em nice, 'cause ain't
no bread in the house.

241
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,583
21, 21, 21.

242
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,834
Don't look at
your hand, honey.

243
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,291
That gal has got to win.

244
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:27,041
Now, honey, you got 15 and
the dealer's showing ten.

245
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,500
Do I hit, Texas,
or do I stand?

246
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:33,417
If you gotta win,
you gotta hit.

247
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,792
Hit me.

248
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,250
Ooh.

249
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,834
TEXAS: Aw.
Damn!

250
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,542
Shoot.

251
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,625
Hit me.

252
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:48,375
Twenty-one, and a winner.
Yessiree!

253
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,000
Hit me.

254
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,000
Another, please.

255
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,542
Don't you think
you've had about enough?

256
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,166
If the objective of the game

257
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,542
is to approach a total
of 21 points,

258
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,792
I will definitely
need another card.

259
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:02,875
Yeah.

260
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,083
Boy, you have got the brass.

261
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,875
Do you know the what odds are
on a five-card Charlie?

262
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:11,709
Hell, you're just
throwing your money away.

263
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,208
Hit me.

264
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,083
TEXAS:
How'd you...

265
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,125
WOMAN:
Ooh!

266
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,375
TEXAS:
Well, shut my mouth.

267
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,625
Hey, you're not one of them
card-counting fellows, are you?

268
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:27,417
The number of the cards
and their values

269
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,417
remain quite constant.

270
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,667
What would be the purpose
in counting them?

271
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:33,917
Yeah.

272
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,250
RIKER:
You having fun, Data?

273
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,291
Fun, sir?

274
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,458
While there is a certain
amount of enjoyment involved,

275
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,250
I am mainly conducting
research in--

276
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,417
Save it.
We're getting out of here.

277
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,709
Understood, sir.

278
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,125
TEXAS:
Guys are holding up the game.

279
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,667
Our apologies, sir.

280
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:50,458
I'll watch your chips.

281
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,083
Oh, thank you, sir.

282
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,667
Hey...

283
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:55,333
The hat.

284
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,500
Sorry, sir.

285
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,083
Deal 'em up.

286
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,083
Progress?

287
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,750
We've accessed the range of
encoding scheme alternates.

288
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,792
The difficulty's in
the frequency range.

289
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,875
And the interference
is highly variable.

290
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:17,250
See, the problem may be

291
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,917
with the envelope
covering the structure.

292
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,166
There are hydrogen-carbon
helix patterns throughout.

293
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,417
Any transmissions
are simply scattered

294
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,750
and refracted at random.

295
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,125
No wonder you can't
get through.

296
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,542
Exactly.

297
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,333
PICARD: Those are some
fairly aggressive

298
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,667
computations, Lieutenant.

299
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,375
I'm comparing the
molecular integrity

300
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:38,125
of that bubble against
our phasers.

301
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,959
Is penetration possible?

302
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,458
I don't know just yet,
it may be an option.

303
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,417
I'd like to run this test.

304
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,542
Make it so.

305
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,166
Let's try that again.

306
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,834
Let's find another way
out of here.

307
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,000
Excuse me.

308
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,125
Excuse me.
Aside from the main door,

309
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,917
is there another exit
I might use?

310
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,875
(<i> slot machine ringing</i> )

311
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,125
(<i> gasps</i> )
Ooh!

312
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,709
Excuse...

313
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,959
Excuse me...

314
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:02,959
Say, I was wondering if
you could tell me...

315
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,625
(<i> grunts</i> )

316
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,208
It's a good deal of
structural integrity, Worf.

317
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,792
Permission to use
phaser, sir.

318
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,458
Granted.

319
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,542
Sir, I can find
no other exits.

320
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,041
I believe
we are trapped here.

321
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,041
<i>Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

322
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,125
<i>We remain in orbit</i>
<i>around Theta Eight,</i>

323
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,792
<i>still out of contact</i>
<i>with the away team.</i>

324
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,458
We're almost there, Captain.

325
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
We'll be able to attempt
contact in a few minutes.

326
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,208
Captain, the situation
down there has changed.

327
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:27,834
In what way?

328
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:32,083
Commander Riker has
become tense...

329
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,000
closed in.
He's feeling trapped.

330
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,000
Phasers are totally
ineffective on all surfaces.

331
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,917
Sir, our options
appear quite limited.

332
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,625
We don't have any.
If we're going to get

333
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:50,792
out of here, we're going to
have to do it on our own.

334
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,834
I'm gonna get some answers
out of that desk clerk.

335
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:03,166
Are you crazy?

336
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,417
Wrong.

337
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,166
I'm finally getting
some smarts.

338
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,583
You think you're gonna scare
Mickey D with that gun?

339
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,792
I'm gonna make him
leave Rita alone.

340
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,875
Kid, she's a big girl.

341
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,625
And she's
Mickey D's girl.

342
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:17,834
Not anymore.
Not after tonight.

343
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,375
Look kid, I like you.

344
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:20,875
I don't wanna
see you get hurt,

345
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:22,667
especially over
some dame.

346
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,750
Don't call her that.

347
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:26,041
You'll see.

348
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,667
You'll see how tough
Mickey D is.

349
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:30,417
He's nothing.

350
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,375
(<i> deep sigh</i> )

351
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:37,041
I want some answers.

352
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,375
I'm sure the concierge
will be happy--

353
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:40,333
We would like to
get out of here<i> now.</i>

354
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,542
The Royale's exits
are clearly marked.

355
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,834
That's not good enough.

356
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,542
If you have a complaint
about the service

357
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,208
you've received
during your stay here,

358
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,166
you can always take it up
with the manager.

359
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,166
Fine, I'd like to
see him immediately.

360
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,875
I'm afraid the manager
is very busy.

361
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,083
PICARD:
Riker, can you read me?

362
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,500
Yes.

363
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,583
There's a good deal of
interference, Captain,

364
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,375
but you are getting through.

365
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:12,166
Number One, why haven't
you left that building?

366
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,041
We tried, sir, it seems
like we're trapped in here.

367
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,917
We're in no immediate danger,
but I am concerned.

368
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:21,250
Something about your location is
interfering with communication.

369
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,875
We are working on the problem.

370
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:24,542
RIKER:
Standing by, sir.

371
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,333
Captain, these frequencies
are unstable.

372
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,458
Then find others.

373
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,792
Yes, sir.

374
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,917
What is going on
down there?

375
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,083
DATA:
Commander?

376
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,208
I am picking up
something most unusual

377
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,709
in another section
of this structure.

378
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,458
It appears to be human DNA.

379
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,750
Where?

380
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:55,083
31.9 meters above
and to the right of us.

381
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,333
Perhaps those turbolifts
could take us there.

382
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,542
Seems to be
malfunctioning.

383
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:12,667
(<i> elevator dings</i> )

384
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,542
(<i> elevator dings</i> )

385
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:35,625
The reading I received is
from behind this door, sir.

386
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:57,125
My reading is
intensifying, sir.

387
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,208
RIKER:
Are you getting any life signs?

388
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,083
None, sir.

389
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,250
Definitely human.
Male.

390
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,083
Looks like the poor devil
died in his sleep.

391
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:29,333
What a terrible
way to die.

392
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:32,458
He has been dead for
283 years, sir.

393
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,417
The lack of any
advanced decomposition

394
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,667
is due to the sterile
environment.

395
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,417
Why would anyone
go to all this trouble?

396
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,583
It's just window dressing
for a dead man.

397
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,333
WORF:
Commander.

398
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:49,041
Is this significant, sir?

399
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,417
American.

400
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,917
DATA:
52 stars, sir.

401
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:59,000
Places it between
2033 and 2079 A.D.

402
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:01,583
Correlates with the
debris we found.

403
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,667
Colonel S. Richey.

404
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:13,542
Rest in peace,
Colonel.

405
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,959
Picard to Riker.

406
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,500
Finally.
Riker. Go ahead.

407
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:22,166
You're coming through
clearly now.

408
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:24,083
What's your situation?

409
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,166
Well, this structure was
apparently made to resemble

410
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:27,792
20th century Earth.

411
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,625
All attempts to exit
have failed.

412
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:32,125
PICARD: We haven't found a way
to transport you back yet.

413
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,500
I assumed as much, sir.

414
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:35,458
We've also located the
remains of a human.

415
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,667
Request
identity scan.

416
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:40,000
Colonel Richey,
American,

417
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,083
first initial, "S."

418
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,834
Roughly the same
time period.

419
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,542
Do it.

420
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:49,417
Commander,
some curiosities.

421
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:55,792
Books.
A novel--<i> Hotel Royale.</i>

422
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,792
Summarize, please.

423
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:03,166
Information retrieved,
Captain.

424
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,417
Number One?

425
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:06,667
RIKER:
Go ahead, Captain.

426
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:08,834
We have the information
you requested.

427
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:12,125
Colonel Stephen Richey
was the commanding officer

428
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:13,917
of the explorer ship
<i>Charybdis,</i>

429
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:19,375
which had a terrestrial
launch date of July 23, 2037.

430
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:21,250
It was the third
manned attempt

431
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:24,375
to travel beyond the confines
of Earth's solar system.

432
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:28,959
Its telemetry failed,
it was never heard from again.

433
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,166
Do you believe that
you've discovered

434
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,000
the remains of
Colonel Richey?

435
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,625
Yes. And Captain,
we found something else.

436
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:38,500
A novel by Todd Matthews
entitled<i> Hotel Royale,</i>

437
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,959
which is the name
of this structure.

438
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,625
Data.

439
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:45,291
Captain, this is the story of
a group of compulsive gamblers

440
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:48,000
caught up in a web of crime,
corruption and deceit.

441
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:51,125
It is told by
nefarious lothario, Mickey D,

442
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,500
who appears only at the
climax of the story,

443
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:55,375
to carry out the
cold-blooded murder

444
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:56,917
of the hotel bellboy.

445
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:59,583
There is also a subplot
about an older man

446
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,208
conspiring with
a younger woman

447
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,709
to murder her husband.

448
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,542
She is squandering
her inheritance--

449
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:07,041
Captain, this novel and
everything Data just described

450
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,917
seems to be exactly what's
happening at this hotel.

451
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,417
Extraordinary.

452
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:13,625
RIKER: There's also
one other thing.

453
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,291
A diary with only one entry,

454
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,959
obviously made
by Colonel Richey.

455
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,166
PICARD: Can you read it?

456
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,625
Yes.

457
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,250
"I write this in the hope

458
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,458
"that it will someday
be read by human eyes.

459
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,166
"I can only surmise
at this point,

460
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:29,166
"but apparently our exploratory
shuttle was contaminated

461
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:30,792
"by an alien life-form

462
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:34,208
"which infected and killed
all personnel except myself.

463
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,375
"I awakened to find myself
here in the Royale Hotel

464
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:41,458
"precisely as described in
the novel I found in my room.

465
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,625
"And for the last 38 years
I have survived here.

466
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:50,208
"I have come to understand
that the alien contaminators

467
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,375
"created this place for me
out of some sense of guilt,

468
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:56,208
"presuming that the novel
we had on board the shuttle

469
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,583
"about the Hotel Royale

470
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:01,125
"was in fact a guide to
our preferred lifestyle

471
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,333
"and social habits.

472
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:06,709
"Obviously, they thought this
was the world from which I came.

473
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,041
"I hold no malice
toward my benefactors.

474
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,709
"They could not possibly
know the hell

475
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,041
"that they have
put me through.

476
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:14,875
"For it was such
a badly written book

477
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:18,250
"filled with endless cliche
and shallow characters.

478
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,583
I shall welcome death
when it comes."

479
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:30,583
I understand,
Number One.

480
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,875
Now, we know why
all that is there,

481
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:36,625
why can't<i> you</i> get out?

482
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:46,000
Number One.
RIKER: Yes, sir.

483
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:48,000
Lieutenant La Forge
has a thought.

484
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:51,291
He believes we can phaser
a slice in the field

485
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,000
surrounding the structure.

486
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,709
That means the atmosphere of the
planet would instantly rush in.

487
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,375
Our projected survival would
be approximately 12 seconds.

488
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:01,625
Correct.
The cryogenic process

489
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:03,625
would be nearly
instantaneous.

490
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,583
RIKER: But I assume
you could revive us?

491
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:08,417
Yes, in theory.

492
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,417
PICARD:
You must understand, Number One.

493
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,792
We'll wait here for
months if necessary.

494
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,333
We're just
considering options.

495
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,834
RIKER:
If you're trying to motivate us

496
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:18,542
to find our own
way out of here,

497
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:19,875
you've succeeded, Captain.

498
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:23,500
(<i> telephone ringing</i> )

499
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,583
Yes?

500
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:47,959
There is a female voice
asking if we want room service.

501
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,542
I believe she is asking if
we want the room cleaned.

502
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,625
Tell her no.

503
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:58,375
No.

504
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,417
What did she say?

505
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,917
She said the kitchen
will be open 24 hours

506
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,709
if we change our minds.

507
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,834
We'll go to explore
the rest of the hotel.

508
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,750
We'll keep a com line open.
You two, go down

509
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,291
to the lobby and see if there's
anything that we missed.

510
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,709
You talk to the guests,
try to find out

511
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,000
who or what they are.

512
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,208
I'll check out the
rest of the floors.

513
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:39,250
Computer, locate and display
the text of the novel

514
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:43,709
entitled<i> Hotel Royale,</i> 
by Todd Matthews.

515
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,583
COMPUTER:
Accessing.

516
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:49,250
If the cause of the
difficulties is in the novel,

517
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:51,875
we may find the solution
within its pages.

518
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,208
Ah.

519
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,709
"It was a dark and
stormy night..."

520
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

521
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,125
That's not a promising
beginning.

522
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,375
It may get better.

523
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,458
I suggest we separate and
blend in with these beings.

524
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,250
Casual queries offered
inconspicuously

525
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:23,542
might prove fruitful.

526
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:29,000
(<i> overlapping chatter</i> )

527
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:38,542
WOMAN:
I need a four. Give me a four.

528
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,542
Damn!
Oh, shoot!

529
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,500
How much do I
have left here?

530
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:45,125
Honey, now, you know
it's bad luck

531
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,709
to count your
chips at the table.

532
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,583
Yeah?
Excuse me, sir.

533
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:52,000
Might I inquire,
where are you from?

534
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:54,208
Lubbock, Texas.

535
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,750
And how did
you get here?

536
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:57,917
To Vegas?

537
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,333
Drove my car.

538
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,417
I got a '91 Caddy with
only 80,000 miles on it.

539
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,000
Where is your
automobile now?

540
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,709
Out front, I suppose.

541
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,625
What the hell difference
does it make?

542
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:09,792
Could you take me there?

543
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:11,458
WOMAN:
Hit me.

544
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:14,583
I'm losing my shirt.

545
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:18,250
TEXAS: Son, why would
I want to do that?

546
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:21,166
Can't you see I'm trying
to help this little lady?

547
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:24,667
I believe you are trapped
inside the Royale,

548
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,542
just as I am.

549
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,041
Sure does seem that way when
you're losing, don't it?

550
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,542
We're just trying to
turn this lady wagon around

551
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,542
and win back some
lost change.

552
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,583
Otherwise, she's in
a desperate situation

553
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,583
and she's got nowhere to turn.

554
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,041
Well...

555
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,875
almost nowhere.

556
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,792
I stay, right?

557
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:47,542
I wouldn't.

558
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,792
The odds favor
standing pat.

559
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,083
What do I do?

560
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,125
Do you want a card or not?

561
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,875
Hit me.

562
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:07,583
Oh, too many.

563
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,166
Oh...

564
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,875
I've almost lost it all.

565
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:14,041
What am I gonna do?

566
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:16,542
There, there, there...

567
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,166
What did you find?

568
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,458
Nothing.

569
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,917
ASSISTANT MANAGER:
Kid, Rita just called.

570
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,250
She did?
What did she say?

571
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,375
It was kinda hard
to tell, she was crying.

572
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:37,333
Crying?
Damn!

573
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:40,000
Mickey D thinks he can treat
people any way he wants.

574
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:42,417
Well, that's all over now.

575
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,166
You were told.

576
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,250
It's not for you
to make the call.

577
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:10,250
It's for Rita.

578
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:12,750
She sent me to tell you.

579
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:14,625
Okay, boys, look,
we can't afford

580
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:16,000
to have any trouble in here.

581
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,333
Why don't you just
take this outside?

582
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:19,583
Yeah.

583
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,083
I like that.

584
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,208
Come on, baggage man.

585
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,208
Let's you and me
take it outside.

586
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,959
BELLBOY: When I was a kid,
I used to look up to you guys.

587
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,583
The suit,
the fancy shoes.

588
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:35,583
I really thought that
made you somebody.

589
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:37,458
But you're nobody.

590
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,250
(<i> Picard lowers volume</i> )

591
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,083
I don't believe
this dialogue.

592
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:43,500
Did humans really
talk like that?

593
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:45,125
Not in real life.

594
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,750
Remember, everything that's
going on down there

595
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:49,667
is taken from what
Colonel Richey calls

596
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:52,542
a second-rate novel.

597
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:56,250
BELLBOY: ...Rita, she could
do something with her life.

598
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:58,333
With your permission, sir.

599
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,542
MICKEY D:
She's somebody, she's my girl.

600
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:01,959
BELLBOY:
You got her on the stuff.

601
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,792
That's the only reason
she stays with you.

602
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:05,542
Because you
feed her sickness.

603
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,875
You gotta let me help her.

604
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:13,417
Well, why don't we just go
outside and talk about it?

605
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,583
Just watch yourself.

606
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,417
Don't worry.

607
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:26,875
It's all part
of the novel.

608
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,792
Don't interfere.

609
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:36,458
(<i> screams</i> )

610
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:58,000
You shoulda listened
to me, kid.

611
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:01,333
No woman's
worth dying for.

612
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:05,709
Killing for, not dying for.

613
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,375
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

614
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,041
Yes, Number One.

615
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:30,750
RIKER: A bizarre incident
just took place.

616
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:33,709
The shoot-out between
the bellboy and Mickey D.

617
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,041
Yes, and Mickey D just
walked out the door.

618
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,291
How did he do that?

619
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:42,458
It's on page 244.

620
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,667
In the novel, right.

621
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:46,959
How does it end?

622
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,083
A bad love affair ends
in a bloody shoot-out.

623
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:54,458
The hotel gets bought out,
and life goes on...

624
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,750
such as it is.

625
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:58,291
The hotel gets bought?
By whom?

626
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:03,250
It isn't specific.

627
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:05,291
Simply refers to
"foreign investors."

628
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:09,208
Sale price: 12.5 million
United States dollars.

629
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,667
They return home, leaving the
assistant manager in charge.

630
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:22,250
Captain, that's how
we're getting out.

631
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,709
We're buying this place.

632
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,333
It is all a question
of probabilities.

633
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:37,625
Quite simple, really,

634
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:39,625
if one bets with any
sequential consistency.

635
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,000
Elaborate.

636
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,208
The combinations
totalling seven or 11

637
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,250
have considerable value when
achieved on the primary attempt.

638
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:49,208
With eight variations possible
to create those totals,

639
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,041
the likelihood
of those totals occurring

640
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,375
is not significant, however--

641
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,083
Okay, okay, can you do it?

642
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,875
I believe so, sir.

643
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:03,000
Eight's the point.
Eighter from Decatur.

644
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:05,417
Can I see no eyes?
Do it, do it.

645
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,375
Oh, snake eyes.

646
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:13,000
Single digits on each cube
are not at all desirable.

647
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,542
You're almost broke.

648
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,917
Relax, honey.
It's only money.

649
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,208
Yeah, but if you
lose it all,

650
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,917
I won't even have
a place to sleep.

651
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:22,041
Don't you worry your
little head, honey.

652
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,250
I'd never let that happen.

653
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:31,166
Go, baby.
Let's go.

654
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,500
Here they come.
Here they come, babe.

655
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,500
CROUPIER: Seven, out.
TEXAS: Ah, I'm out.

656
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,917
Your turn, slick.

657
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:39,250
Go to work.

658
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:41,917
Maybe this turkey will
bring us some luck.

659
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:54,917
Six.
Six is your number.

660
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,291
Hell, my blind grandma
can make a six, boy.

661
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,875
Come on, roll 'em.

662
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:01,250
I thought seven
and 11 had value.

663
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:03,250
Actually, six is a valid point.

664
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:05,125
Of course, now, the objective
is to roll

665
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:07,333
a duplicate six
before hitting seven.

666
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,125
But the probability
of making a six

667
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:11,667
is no greater than
that of rolling a seven.

668
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:14,625
There is a certain degree of
random fortune involved.

669
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:17,083
I believe that is why
they call it gambling.

670
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,125
Yeah.

671
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:25,792
CROUPIER: Seven.
Seven away. Next shooter.

672
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:28,041
So much for
your new turkey.

673
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:30,000
Give slick another shot.

674
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:32,417
I got a feeling
about you, boy.

675
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:39,542
Commander, these cubes are
improperly balanced.

676
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:41,375
I believe their final
resting position would be--

677
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,834
Can you repair them?

678
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,250
I believe so.

679
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,542
I will make another attempt.

680
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,375
Baby needs a new pair
of shoes.

681
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:59,709
11! That a boy.

682
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,667
Do that a few more times,
we all gonna get well.

683
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,917
Whoo!

684
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:08,500
Seven, winner.

685
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:11,792
And another one!
(<i> laughing</i> )

686
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:14,166
Keep going, boy, we got 'em
hot now, let's go, let's go!

687
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:15,709
RIKER: Double 'em up.
Here we go.

688
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,875
Keep it rolling, boy,
keep it rolling.

689
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,959
TEXAS:
Seven, a winner!

690
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:29,083
Status, Number One?

691
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:31,166
We're having a nice
run of luck, Captain.

692
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,959
PICARD: Don't get out
of character, Commander.

693
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,166
Sir?

694
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:36,125
The foreign investors
in the book

695
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:40,333
are described
as flamboyantly generous.

696
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,750
Yes, sir.
I understand.

697
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:51,333
Whoo! Big seven.
Look at that!

698
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:54,750
Oh!
Tex, darling.

699
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:56,750
You're brilliant.

700
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:58,667
Yeah, and I'm
good-looking, too, huh?

701
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:00,458
(<i> laughing</i> )

702
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,583
Isn't that enough?

703
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,625
No, don't wanna
come up short.

704
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:04,834
You are keeping count?

705
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,291
Yes, sir.
12.3 million.

706
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,125
Perhaps I
will bet...

707
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,834
$700,000.

708
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,041
No, bet it all.

709
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:16,333
But sir, the sale price of this
edifice is 12.5 million.

710
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:18,709
We need some
spreading around money, Data.

711
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,792
Sir?

712
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:22,041
Bet it all.
Here you go.

713
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:24,125
A little something
for you, Ziggy.

714
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:26,667
A little something for
those cocktail waitresses.

715
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:29,250
Run this outside and give it
to the parking lot attendants.

716
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,166
You're very kind, sir.

717
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,375
Here you go, Vanessa.
A little something for you, too.

718
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:34,834
Thank you.

719
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:37,875
When the train comes in,
everybody rides.

720
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:40,500
Yeah, and I'm getting
off at this station.

721
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:43,917
After 18 passes,
air gets a little too thin

722
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,709
for this country boy.

723
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,458
I'm betting against
you fellows.

724
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,917
Are you nuts?

725
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:51,291
I do not believe that is
a prudent choice, sir.

726
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:54,750
Hey, that's what
horse racing's about.

727
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:56,125
Roll 'em, boy.

728
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:11,792
CROUPIER:
Seven. Seven a winner.

729
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,375
Whoo!

730
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:16,834
The man has the touch.

731
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:21,875
You knew you were gonna throw
that seven, didn't you?

732
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:25,083
You just let me
go down the tubes.

733
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,000
I tried to caution you, sir.

734
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:28,750
What was it?
I mean...

735
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:31,291
was it personal or-- or what?

736
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,709
Because I didn't
show you my car?

737
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:37,083
Now.

738
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,750
I wish to cash in, sir.

739
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:41,375
I'm afraid you've
broken the bank.

740
00:42:41,417 --> 00:42:44,792
Just take 12.5 million, the
purchase price of this hotel.

741
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:46,542
Spread the rest around.

742
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,583
Whew.

743
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:51,875
You're the foreign investors.

744
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:53,792
That's right.

745
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:57,166
We just bought this place,
lock, stock and barrel.

746
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,125
Consider it a done deal.

747
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:02,750
I like you fellas.
You got style.

748
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:04,583
Let me buy
you guys a drink.

749
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,333
Just enjoy the game.

750
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,166
Don't let 'em change
the dice on you.

751
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,208
TEXAS:
You got it.

752
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,417
Phew.

753
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:29,834
<i>Enterprise,</i> this
is the away team.

754
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:31,417
We're clear of
the structure.

755
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:32,875
Three to beam up.

756
00:43:32,917 --> 00:43:35,417
Time to come home now,
Number One.

757
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:37,875
Transporter room,
we have a fix on the away team.

758
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:39,458
Beam them up.

759
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,083
(<i> chime</i> )

760
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:51,750
Come.

761
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:55,000
Sir.

762
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,125
Welcome back, Number One.

763
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,834
Very strange experience.
Puzzling.

764
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:01,291
I still can't comprehend
how Colonel Richey's vessel

765
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,834
could've traveled
out that far.

766
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:05,125
Not on its own,
at any rate.

767
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,834
Perhaps they were
brought here

768
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:10,417
by whoever created that
make-believe world down there.

769
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,875
It's possible they didn't
know how fragile

770
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:15,667
the humans aboard
actually were.

771
00:44:15,709 --> 00:44:18,333
Only one of them survived.

772
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:21,792
None of it
makes any sense.

773
00:44:21,834 --> 00:44:26,041
Like Fermat's theorem, it's
a puzzle we may never solve.
