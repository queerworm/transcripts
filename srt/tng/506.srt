Yes, I do.

I have a terrible problem
down here on Risa.

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,792
Give me that.

15
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,041
Go get it.

16
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:04,208
I don't believe
you did that.

00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,250
Believe it.

What is this?

21
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,625
It's a game.

23

It's fun.

24
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,625
Do I keep my eyes
open or closed?

25
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:41,959
Open.

26
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:46,375
What am I seeing?

27
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,542

The playing field.

28
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,709
Now what?

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,500
You see the disk
and the cone?

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,333
Yeah.

31
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,000
Concentrate.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,041
Make the disk
go into the cone.

33
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,625
How do I do that?

34
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,000
Just let go.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,041
Relax.
You'll do it.

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,709
What was that?

00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,667
Your reward...

38
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,750
for clearing
the first level.

39
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,417
How far does
this game go?

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,125
As far as you
can take it.

41
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,917
Would you like to go
for level two?

42
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:50,834

are filling up fast.

59

On top of everything,
there's been a change.

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,375
We've been given only two weeks
to complete the exploration.

61
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,875
Two weeks?

62
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,417
That's not enough time to
explore a region that size.

63
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,959
I thought we had
five weeks.

64
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,333
Commander, Starfleet has
added a diplomatic mission

65
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,834
to Oceanus IV.

66
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,792
Will, I'm leaving it
up to you to make sure

67
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,917
that all the science departments
have an equal chance

68
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:28,250
of completing
their research.

69
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,041
Could be quite
a juggling act.

70
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,792
Oh, and one piece
of good news:

71
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,709
we're to rendezvous with a
shuttle carrying Wesley Crusher.

72
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,000
He's on vacation
from the academy.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,750
Wesley, good. We'll need
an extra hand around here.

74
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:53,375
Geordi, how are you coming
with the survey preparations?

75
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,458
I'm up to my neck in observation
schedules right now.

76
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:59,208
Our biggest hurdle
is sensor availability.

77
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,250
Yeah, especially since
two new exobiologists

78
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,959
and three stellar cartographers
have joined us from the<i> Zhukov.</i>

79
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,208
15 science teams, only two
weeks, and one long-range array

80
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,542
doesn't make for
a great combination.

81
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,250
What about
the lateral sensors?

82
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,417
They're booked solid
for planetary observation.

83
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,792
And the gamma ray scanner?
We're reprogramming them now--

84
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,959
Lefler, a moment of
your time, please.

85
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,083
You know Robin Lefler.
Of course.

86
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,834
Her work around here
has been so sensational,

87
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:22,709
I've decided to make her
a mission specialist.

88
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:24,750
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.

89
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,750
All right, specialist,
what is our sensor status?

90
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,250
We're increasing
the available bandwidth

91
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,792
so more science teams
can use the sensors at once.

92
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,667
We figured out a way to do it
by multiplexing the array.

93
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,625
Can we have that done
before we arrive?

94
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,667
Yes, sir,
you can count on it.

95
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,875
Keep it up, Lefler.

96
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,834
Geordi, I brought
something back from Risa

97
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:46,000
that you have got to try.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,500
I'd love to,

99
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,458
but I'm running
a full sensor recalibration

100
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,792
in about ten minutes.

101
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,291
Can it wait?
Of course.

102
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,250
I'll catch up with you later.
Mm-hmm.

103
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,000
Chocolate ice cream,

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,500
chocolate fudge
and chocolate chips.

105
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,375
You're not depressed,
are you?

106
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,125
I'm fine, Commander.

107
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,291
Would you like me
to leave you two alone?

108
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,875
No, you can join us.

109
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:49,333
No, thanks.
I don't like fudge.

110
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,000
Really?

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,375
I never met a chocolate
I didn't like.

112
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,458
Doesn't it taste good?

113
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,834
Mm, of course it does,

114
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:03,208
but it's not just
a matter of taste.

115
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,792
It's the whole experience.

116
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,834
First of all,

117
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,208
you have to spoon the fudge

118
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,667
around the rim,

119
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:17,291
leaving only the ice cream
in the middle.

120
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,792
Then you gently spoon

121
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:22,917
the ice cream
around the sides,

122
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:25,333
like you're sculpting it.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,709
Relish every bite.

124
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,709
Make every one an event,

125
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:35,208
and then,

126
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,834
with the last spoonful,

127
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:40,417
close your eyes...

128
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:50,959
I had no idea
it was such a ritual.

129
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,291
Chocolate is
a serious thing.

130
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:59,667
I brought something
back from Risa.

131
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:02,250
Better than chocolate.

132
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,917
Oh?

133
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,417
What is it?

134
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,709
Just a game.

135
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,834
Chief O'Brien.

136
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:32,166
Welcome back, Wesley.

137
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,750
Congratulations
on little Molly.
Thank you.

138
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,166
Wait till you see her, she's
the spitting image of her dad.

139
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,291
So where is everybody?

140
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,834
Is my mom around?

141
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,583
The senior staff
is in a meeting.

142
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,333
You're supposed to go to
your mother's quarters.

143
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,750
Oh.

144
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,542
Do you think
it would be all right

145
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,333
if I dropped in
just to say hi?

146
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,792
I'll check.

147
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,250
Chief O'Brien
to Bridge.

148
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,750
WORF:
Bridge here.

149
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,542
Wesley Crusher
has arrived

150
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,875
and wants to know if he can
stop by the Observation Lounge

151
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,083
to say... hi.

152
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,291
WORF:
I suppose that is acceptable.

153
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,834
Thanks.

154
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,625

Surprise!

155
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,041

uniform justice, Wesley.

169

Wesley, was our attempt

170
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,542
to make you
uncomfortable effective?
You bet it was.

171
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,542
For a second there, I thought
I was on the wrong ship.

Yeah. It's fun
to be surprised.

176

Are you here to work,
or to play, Mr. Crusher?

177

Sir?

178
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,417
I know you're on vacation,
probably would like to sleep,

spend some time

for the Phoenix
Cluster survey.

182
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,000
Sounds great, sir.

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,291
Excellent,
soon as you get settled,
come down to Engineering.

184
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,166
We'll get you started, huh?
Okay.

185
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,875
Aww.

186
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,083
So what kind of
game is this?

187
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,250
Come by my quarters
and I'll show it to you.

188
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,917
Have you found the academy
challenging, Wesley?
Yeah.

189
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:41,417
I thought after
being on the<i> Enterprise</i> 
it would be a breeze,

190
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:45,208
but there's a lot more to learn
than just starship operations.

191
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,583
What was your
first year like?

192
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,834
Although I did extremely
well scholastically,

193
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,542
my lack of
human understanding

194
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:54,208
often created
social obstacles.

195
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,917
Like what?

196
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:59,041
I particularly remember the
phenomenon of practical jokes,

197
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,000
several of which
I fell victim to.

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,417
Tell me about it.

199
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,583
The first week
that I was there,

200
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,709
this guy named
Adam Martoni

201
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,750
reprogrammed the sonic shower
to cover me with mud.

202
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,291
It took me a while,

203
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,625
but I got him back
really good.

204
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:18,208
Good for you.
Thanks.

205
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,875
I also found social
gatherings difficult.

206
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,667
There was one event,
an academy tradition,

207
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,333
the Sadie Hawkins dance?

208
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,583
They still hold it
every year.

209
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,583
A notably awkward
experience.

210
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,041
I know what you mean.

211
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,583
I can't even dance.
Really?

212
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,250
Your mother
is quite an expert.

213
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,917
She recently taught me.

214
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:38,375
The Dancing Doctor?

215
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,667
Yeah, she tried
to teach me, too,

216
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,166
but I just don't have
the knack.

217
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,291
I would be happy
to teach you dancing.

218
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,041
I have programmed
a comprehensive

219
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,458
17-part course

220
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,792
with some interesting
holographic partners.

221
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:52,333
I'll let you know.

222
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,709
I'll modify
the planetary scanners.

223
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,583
Just make sure we have
enough data lines open

224
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,917
for the stellar physics.
No problem.

225
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,709
I'll compress the signal flow.
All right.

226
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,709
Why aren't these registering?

227
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,625
You might try
calibrating them manually.

228
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,125
Excuse me?

229
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,166
The detectors-- they tend
to get temperamental.

230
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,458
You can try
calibrating them by hand.

231
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,417
Oh.
Oh, you're kidding?

232
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,250
The computer has to do this.

233
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,583
No. Look.

234
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,291
The subroutine lets you
do it from the panel.

235
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,125
Law 17: when all else fails,
do it yourself.

236
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,083
It's working.

237
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,834
Thanks.
Sure.

238
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,792
Uh, by the way...

239
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,083
I'm Wesley.

240
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,041
Wesley Crusher.
I know.

241
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,834
Just back
from the academy.

242
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,917
That's right.

243
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:04,083
Robin Lefler.

244
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,792
Hi.
Hi.

245
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:08,000
(<i> beeping</i> )

246
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,375
Your neutrinos
are drifting.

247
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,667
They're what?

248
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,709
(<i> beeping stops</i> )

249
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,000
Geordi,
a conflict has arisen

250
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,250
between the Planetary Evolution
team and the Stellar Physicists.

251
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,083
Each wishes to be the first to
use the thermal imaging array.

252
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,750
Well, tell them
to flip a coin.

253
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,250
We've got to work together
on this mission,

254
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,291
otherwise we're never
going to get it done.

255
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,792
A coin-- very good.

256
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,250
I will replicate one
immediately.

257
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,333
DR. CRUSHER:
Dr. Crusher to Data.
Data here.

258
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,667
DR. CRUSHER: Do you have
a minute to join me in Sick Bay?

259
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,500
I need your help
with something.

260
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes, Doctor.
On my way.

261
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,583
You wanted to see me, Doctor?
Yes, Data.

262
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,583
I need to ask you
to do something for me.

263
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:58,208
I'm working on a new experiment
with bio-active silicon.

264
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,041
Would you reprogram
this tricorder

265
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,875
to these specifications?
Certainly.

266
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,500
I'm sorry to bother you with it,
but I need it done quickly.

267
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,375
It does not
bother me, Doctor.

268
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,458
In fact, I am happy...

269
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,166
Computer,
secure Sick Bay.

270
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,458
COMPUTER: All entries to
Sick Bay are secured.

271
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,917
Let's see, I have
Novakovich for anthropology

272
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:04,834
and Horne
for creative writing.

273
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:07,417
Walter Horne?
Is he still teaching?

274
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:10,125
Yeah, he is,
and he's good, too.

275
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,667
And you'll be pleased to know

276
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,250
I took your advice.

277
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,542
The first week that I was there,
I went and met Boothby.

278
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:22,792
Ohh... how is old Boothby?

279
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:24,834
I...

280
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,834
I hope he didn't tell you
a lot of stories about me.

281
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:31,458
He didn't remember you, sir.

282
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,208
At first.

283
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,709
I found an old
yearbook photo of you

284
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,208
and he remembered you
right away.

285
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,959
He said he's
very proud of you

286
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:43,583
that you're captain
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

287
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,875
Is he still tending grounds?

288
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,208
Or have the years finally
caught up with him?

289
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,041
Not that I can tell.

290
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,917
He took me on a grand tour
of the place.

291
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:54,583
He showed me every single
blade of grass practically.

292
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,750
I had the very same tour.

293
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,083
Sir...

294
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,750
what do the initials
"A.F." stand for?

295
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,834
A.F.?

296
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,375
Boothby said he caught you

297
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,125
carving those initials
into his prized elm tree.

298
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,333
A.F...

299
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,834
Oh...

300
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:24,500
just an acquaintance of mine.

301
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,291
Wesley, if you meet someone

302
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,000
whose initials you might want
to carve into that elm tree,

303
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,917
don't let it interfere
with your studies.

304
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:42,750
I failed organic chemistry
because of A.F.

305
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,750
DR. CRUSHER:
Crusher to Captain Picard.

306
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,583
Go ahead, Doctor.

307
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,208
DR. CRUSHER: I need you
in Sick Bay immediately.

308
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,041
On my way.

309
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,625
He came in complaining
of a servo malfunction,

310
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,375
but my scans
came out negative.

311
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,125
Then he just collapsed.
What have you found?

312
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,250
His bio-systems
and positronic functions

313
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,542
seem to check out.

314
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,375
His power cells
are active.

315
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,709
From what I can tell,
his higher functions are intact,

316
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:13,625
but the signals aren't
getting from his brain
to the rest of his body.

317
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,625
It's like a he's in a coma.

318
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,458
Data performs self-diagnostic
routines on a regular basis.

319
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,917
We should take a look at his
logs, they may reveal something.

320
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:22,542
I recommend going through
his quarters as well,

321
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,709
you never know what
we might find.

322
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:24,667
Agreed.

323
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:25,792
Continue the analysis.

324
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,750
Keep me informed.

325
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:36,917
Standard security sweep shows
nothing out of the ordinary.

326
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,000
Personal logs...

327
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,500
diagnostics,

328
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,542
duty logs--
they all look normal.

329
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:46,333
There's no evidence of anything
that could lead to Data's
shutdown.

330
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,000
Maybe we should
ask his cat.

331
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,250
I guess I'd better
get back to Sick Bay,

332
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,875
see if there's any change
in his condition.

333
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,000
Dr. Crusher's got everything
under control, Geordi.

334
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,166
If there's any change,
you'd be the first to know.

335
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,542
I guess so.

336
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:02,291
Looks to me like
you need a break.

337
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,500
Unwind a little.

338
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,959
Yeah, maybe you're right.

339
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,542
I've got just the thing.

340
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,166
Why don't you join me
in Ten Forward?

341
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,000
There's something
I'd like you to try.

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,166
WESLEY: Conduits 12 and 22
are still down for testing.

343
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,917
ROBIN: We can reroute
through junction 14-B.

344
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:21,542
You have a funny way
of looking

345
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,834
at conduit configuration,
but it works.

346
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:27,250
That's law 36: you got
to go with what works.

347
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,583
What are all these laws
that I keep hearing?

348
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,000
They're my
personal laws.

349
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,542
Every time I learn
something essential,

350
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:34,709
I make up a law about it
so I never forget.

351
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:37,917
How many do you have?
102, so far.

352
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,375
Looks like the starboard array
needs another sub-processor.

353
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,917
It will be online
in a few minutes.

354
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,250
I'm way ahead of you.

355
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,000
They said you were good.

356
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,834
Why do I get the feeling
that you already know me?

357
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,875
I have few friends
at the academy.

358
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,291
Your name's come up
a couple of times.

359
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:01,000
That's really some stunt
you pulled on Adam Martoni
in the physics lab.

360
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,583
I just want to know how you got
the anti-matter regulator

361
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,834
to spray chili sauce?

362
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:09,500
There is another side
to that story.

363
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,000
Is it true what they say
about your birthmark?

364
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:14,959
This isn't fair.

365
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,291
I hardly know
anything about you.

366
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,709
Hey...

367
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:20,709
that's law 46:
life isn't...

368
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:22,125
...always fair.
...always fair.

369
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,375
Yeah, I know that law.

370
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,917
I still have to work
on the sensor relays,

371
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:33,458
but I'd like a chance
to even the score.

372
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,500
Ten Forward,
1900 hours.

373
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,875
Will you join me
for coffee?

374
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,834
No.

375
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:42,083
But I'll meet you
for dinner.

376
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,667
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental:</i>

377
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,709
<i>We have arrived</i>
<i>at the Phoenix Cluster,</i>

378
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:51,291
<i>but it will take us</i>
<i>several hours</i>

379
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,000
<i>to determine the best</i>
<i>possible location</i>

380
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,542
<i>from which to conduct</i>
<i>our survey.</i>

381
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:58,875
<i>Commander Data's condition</i>
<i>remains unchanged</i>

382
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,417
<i>with no further indication</i>

383
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:02,875
<i>as to the cause</i>
<i>of his collapse.</i>

384
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:09,125
(<i> gasps of pleasure</i> )

385
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:20,000
Mom?
Wesley!

386
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,667
What are you doing?

387
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,333
I'm embarrassed to say.

388
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,959
This was meant for you,

389
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,709
but it was so much fun,
I couldn't resist.

390
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,750
What is it?

391
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,583
It's a game.

392
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:41,000
Riker brought it back
from Risa.

393
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,750
Everybody's playing it.

394
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,542
Want to try?
Maybe later.
How's Data?

395
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:48,542
Geordi is still
working on him.

396
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,458
He's going to be fine.

397
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,667
I think I should
go give him a hand.
No.

398
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,917
Wesley, you are on vacation.

399
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,709
You have done enough already.

400
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,917
Yeah, maybe you're right.

401
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:06,458
Computer,
increase light level.

402
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,458
Are you in a hurry?

403
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,750
Yeah, I'm late
for a dinner date.

404
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,083
Really?
With who?

405
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,875
Robin Lefler,
from Engineering.

406
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:20,083
Why don't you
invite her here?

407
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,917
We can all play
the game together.

408
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:24,291
I can replicate
a couple more.

409
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,792
Mom...

410
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,458
Sorry.

411
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,208
It's just that...

412
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:33,083
I want to spend some time
together while you're here.

413
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,792
We'll have time together.
I promise.

414
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,625
Okay.
Okay.

415
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,959
Just one game.
Come on, try it on...

416
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:43,375
Mom, I really need
to get ready.

417
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,750
Have a good time.
Thanks.

418
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,792
I will.

419
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:11,125
When your parents
are the only plasma
specialists in the sector,

420
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,417
you do a lot
of traveling around.

421
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:15,166
We went from base
to base to base.

422
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,750
I felt like a piece of
luggage after a while.

423
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,792
I spent all of my time
around technical equipment.

424
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:23,917
My first friend
was a tricorder.
Really?

425
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:26,333
My very first friend
was a warp coil.

426
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:31,166
My parents work
came first.

427
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,333
They didn't really
have time for me.

428
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,250
Even when I needed them.

429
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,625
So that's how I learned
my first law.

430
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,500
Law one: you can only
count on yourself.

431
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,875
Sounds kind of lonely.

432
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,875
Well, now you're here.
Now I'm here.

433
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,875
Well, I'm glad.

434
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,542
So you wouldn't believe
what's going on in Engineering.

435
00:23:58,542 --> 00:23:59,917
Commander La Forge
and all the others,

436
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:01,125
they're crazy about
some new game.

437
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,875
Yeah, what kind of
game is it?

438
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,000
It's some Risian gadget
that fits over your ear.

439
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,500
Have you played it?
Mm-mm. Not yet.

440
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,417
My mom has one.

441
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:10,917
She keeps trying to get
me to play it.

442
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,959
It's everywhere.

443
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,166
See what I mean?

444
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,166
Don't you think that's
a little strange--

445
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,208
everybody playing it,
all the time?

446
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,834
It's just a fad.
It's here this week.

447
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,959
Next week, we won't
even know it existed.

448
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:31,208
I wonder how it works?

449
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,291
Why don't you try it
and find out?

450
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,375
I'd like to know a little bit
more about it before I try it.

451
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,500
I bet if we work together,
we could figure it out.

452
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,917
Yeah, we could hook it up
to one of the computers.

453
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:48,041
The medical programs
in the lab

454
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,959
can be set up to emulate
human responses.

455
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,875
I noticed it uses
a visual interface.

456
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:54,000
We could connect it through
an optical sensor.

457
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,792
I've loaded the neurological
behavior program.

458
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:07,458
This sensor pad will allow
the computer to process

459
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,166
whatever information
the game sends at it.

460
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,917
Let's see what happens.
Okay.

461
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,583
It's activating
the reticular formation.

462
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,709
There's heavy synaptic activity
all over the place.

463
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:23,166
I wonder what happens
after prolonged exposure.

464
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:26,166
Speed up the processor
and we'll find out.

465
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:29,750
ROBIN: The effects seem centered
around the frontal lobe.

466
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,792
Computer, enhance
frontal lobe, full spectrum.

467
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:36,291
ROBIN: It's stimulating
the septal area.

468
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:39,709
That's the pleasure center
of the brain.

469
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:43,291
Whatever this thing does,
it must feel pretty good.

470
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,041
No wonder
it's so popular.

471
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,458
Look at this.

472
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:50,375
Serotonin levels
are way off.

473
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:52,375
Let's run
a neurochemical analysis.

474
00:25:56,834 --> 00:26:00,250
I'm seeing widespread bonding
to neuro-receptors.

475
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,500
Correct me if I'm wrong,

476
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,917
but this looks like
a psychotropic reaction.

477
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:09,208
Are you saying you think
the game's addictive?

478
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,959
What's going on in
the prefrontal cortex?

479
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:17,709
ROBIN: Doesn't that area
control higher reasoning?

480
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,750
Yeah, it sure does.

481
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,583
I better go talk
to the Captain.

482
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,834
Come.

483
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,750
Sorry to bother you, sir.

484
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,417
It's no bother, Wesley.
Please, sit down.

485
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:45,458
Thanks.

486
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,834
How are the survey
preparations coming along?

487
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,458
They're coming along fine,

488
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,375
but that's not what I'm here
to talk to you about.

489
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:55,917
What then?

490
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:02,500
There's a game going around.

491
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,709
It's something that Commander
Riker brought back from Risa.

492
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,750
It's a device that hooks
around the ears.

493
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,166
Hmm.
Yes, I've seen it.

494
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,417
I did some preliminary
tests on the game.

495
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:15,625
And what I found
leads me to believe

496
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:18,458
that it may have some
harmful side effects.

497
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,750
Specifically, sir, I think
it's psychotropically addictive.

498
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,291
Addictive?
What have you discovered?

499
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,625
The game initiates
a serotonin cascade

500
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,417
in the frontal lobe
of the brain.

501
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:31,333
Now, I know that's
nothing conclusive,

502
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:34,125
but it could explain why
everyone is so attracted to it.

503
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:35,917
And at the same time,

504
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:38,500
it stimulates the brain's
reasoning center.

505
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,250
I don't know
what that's all about.

506
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,709
Hmm.

507
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,625
I'll start
an investigation immediately.

508
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,125
Thank you, Mr. Crusher.

509
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,208
Thank you, sir.

510
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,917
Wesley...

511
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:56,417
it's good to
have you back again.

512
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:52,291
O'BRIEN:
Have you tried this?

513
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:55,250
I've tried it.
Thanks, it's great.

514
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:01,792
Robin...
Where have you been?

515
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:03,583
Everybody's after me
to try it.

516
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:06,250
I know. I got stopped
in the corridors twice.

517
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,458
I talked to the Captain.
He's going to look into it.

518
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,500
Well, I hope he makes
a ship-wide announcement
or something.

519
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,875
Because this thing is really
starting to give me the creeps.

520
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,000
Did you forget your games?

521
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,709
We left them
in our quarters.

522
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:19,125
Well, then, you can use mine.
No, thanks.

523
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,959
Try it.
She said, "No, thanks."

524
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,875
You know what else
is really weird?

525
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,875
If this game is so addictive,
there's only one person on board

526
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,917
we can be sure wouldn't be
affected by it.

527
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:32,083
Data.
Right.

528
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,959
And he managed
to get injured

529
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,834
right when the game
was brought on board.

530
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:38,625
We better take
a look at him.

531
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:45,834
WESLEY: Maybe you should
go check again.

532
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:57,333
The nurse is still
playing the game.

533
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,250
I don't know what
to make of this.

534
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,125
There's brain activity, all
his systems seem to be working.

535
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,542
How can that be?
He's unconscious.

536
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,417
Maybe there's a signal breach
between his brain and his body.

537
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,125
Let's map his neuro-system

538
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:14,250
and see if we can
isolate a weak link.

539
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:18,458
Patch the neural output
through to that station.

540
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:23,375
Here!

541
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:26,667
The signal stops just below
his cortex processor.

542
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:31,709
There's some kind of damage.
It's almost unreadable.

543
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,750
Let's look at it
on the viewer.

544
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:40,083
Wesley, look at that.

545
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:43,458
It looks like some of
his positronic links
have been severed.

546
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,875
The cuts are precise.

547
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,917
Look at how clean
the edges are.

548
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:50,041
Computer, increase
magnification, factor four.

549
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:55,959
Only two people on board

550
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:58,875
know enough about Data
to do something like this--

551
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:01,500
Commander La Forge...

552
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,166
and my mother.

553
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:05,709
Why would one of them
do this to him?

554
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,750
Maybe there's more going on
here than we thought.

555
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:15,166
What if someone's trying
to use the game

556
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,583
for some purpose
other than pleasure?

557
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,333
Then Data would be
a threat to that plan,

558
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,333
and only with Data
out of the way

559
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:24,500
would everyone
become addicted.

560
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:29,208
And everyone has...

561
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,917
except us.

562
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,625
We have reached the designated
coordinates, Captain.

563
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:40,917
There's a ship bearing 327.152
on an intercept course.

564
00:31:40,917 --> 00:31:43,917
Advise them of our status,
Mr. Worf.

565
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,834
Go, replicate what you need

566
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:49,250
and see that the devices
are properly distributed...

567
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,750
not forgetting
Mr. Crusher.

568
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:04,500
Wesley?

569
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,542
Wesley?

570
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:12,667
WESLEY:
In here, Mom.

571
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:20,458
(<i> both panting</i> )

572
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:36,208
It worked.

573
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:39,250
We should keep
these mock-ups with us.

574
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,166
We can't trust anyone anymore,
not even the Captain.

575
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:44,542
I'm supposed to be on duty
in Engineering.

576
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,875
I've got to go before Commander
La Forge suspects something.

577
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:50,041
Okay. When you get there,
start accessing the codes

578
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,625
to the security
tracking system.

579
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,583
There's something
I want to try.

580
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:56,834
Wesley,
don't forget law 91:

581
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:58,834
always watch your back.

582
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:01,709
You, too.

583
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,792
The vessel is approaching,
Captain.

584
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:20,125
Computer, all senior officers
report to the Bridge.

585
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,709
On screen.

586
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,333
Report.

587
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,000
PICARD:
Welcome, Etana.

588
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,458
The<i> Enterprise</i> 
has been secured.

589
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,959
We await
your further instructions.

590
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,333
The expansion
will proceed as follows:

591
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,917
Commander Riker,

592
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:50,458
you will pilot a shuttlecraft
to the Cleon system

593
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:52,959
where you will rendezvous
with the starship<i> Endeavor.</i>

594
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:56,208
Proceed with distributing
the device to that vessel.

595
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,542
Commander La Forge,
Counselor Troi,

596
00:33:58,542 --> 00:34:01,166
take a shuttle
to Starbase 67.

597
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,834
Distribute the device
to all starships

598
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,709
currently docked there.

599
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,709
We also have
an opportunity

600
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:10,875
to introduce the game
to Starfleet Academy.

601
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:13,375
Excellent.
See to it.

602
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:16,792
The Ktarians commend
your efforts, Picard.

603
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:19,166
Once the expansion
is complete,

604
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:22,291
you and your crew
will be rewarded.

605
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,959
(<i> moaning</i> )

606
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,083
Deck 36.

607
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,875
Wesley, and what
level are you?

608
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm only level 10.

609
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,041
I'm at level 47.

610
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:56,333
(<i> gasping</i> )

611
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:57,792
That's great.

612
00:34:57,792 --> 00:35:00,500
You know what
the secret is, don't you?

613
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,417
Don't force it.

614
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:05,041
If you just let
the game happen,

615
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:08,000
it almost
plays itself.

616
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,333
(<i> gasps, sighs</i> )

617
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,208
I'll try that.

618
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,625
I think we're
going to be okay.

619
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,709
I've just got
one more thing to do.

620
00:35:23,709 --> 00:35:25,959
Help me compile
the force field overrides.

621
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,458
What are you doing?

622
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,792
I created a site-to-site
transporter program.

623
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:31,041
If things get difficult,

624
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,709
this will keep us one
step ahead of them.

625
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:36,792
Were you able to access
the security tracking codes?

626
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,750
Robin?

627
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,417
It's your turn.

628
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:47,458
Play the game,
Wesley.

629
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:51,375
RIKER:
Get back here!

630
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,750
Computer, activate
security containment field,

631
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,208
Deck 36, Section 52!

632
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:05,959
Computer, transport
program Crusher One.

633
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,583
RIKER: Riker to Bridge,
we lost Crusher.

634
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,917
It appears he rigged
a site-to-site transport.

635
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,792
Security alert,
condition three.

636
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:28,208
Computer, shut down
all Transporter systems
and Shuttle Bays.

637
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:31,041
Mr. La Forge?
I can't track him, sir.

638
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,291
He's done something to
the internal security sensors.

639
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,458
I'll try bypassing
his subcommands.

640
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,250
Hold on.

641
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,291
I'm picking up a piece
of his trail, sir.

642
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:43,291
Sensors show power activation
in Transporter Room Three.

643
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:46,208
That would put him
somewhere on Deck six.
Seal off Deck six.

644
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:50,208
Activate security fields
sections 23 through 29.
Aye, sir.

645
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,792
We've got him, Captain,
Section 25.

646
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:18,458
Looks like he's trying to
cut through the force field
with a phaser.

647
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:20,834
Security to Deck six,
Section 25...

648
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,500
SECURITY:
On our way.

649
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,667
RIKER:
Where the hell is he?

650
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:59,375
WORF: I am attempting to isolate
him with thermal sensors.

651
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,542
Narrow the scan field.
Go deck by deck if you have to.

652
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:04,458
Unfortunately,
he knows our procedures.

653
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:08,125
He will avoid all
corridors and public areas.

654
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:12,000
Commander,
an unidentified heat source.

655
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,250
Deck seven, Section 23.
There!

656
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,208
(<i> grunting</i> )

657
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,166
No!

658
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:01,959
Let go of me!

659
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:13,458
DR. CRUSHER:
It's okay, Wesley.

660
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:17,542
You led us quite
a chase, Mr. Crusher.

661
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:19,542
Dr. Crusher.

662
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,834
No!

663
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:25,291
Hold him steady.

664
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:29,125
DR. CRUSHER:
It's okay, Wesley.
It won't hurt.

665
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,792
No!
You'll like it.

666
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,250
His eyes.

667
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:07,667
DR. CRUSHER:
That's right, Wesley.

668
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:10,125
Just let it go.

669
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,583
Yes.

670
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:14,000
Just let yourself go.

671
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,750
Relax.

672
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:45,458
Computer, resume
normal illumination.

673
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:52,166
Mr. Worf, you will find

674
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:54,333
a small alien ship
off the starboard bow.

675
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,959
Please secure it with a tractor
beam and raise our shields.

676
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:59,917
Engaging tractor beam.

677
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:02,792
DATA: Are you all right,
Captain?

678
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:05,000
I think so, Mr. Data.

679
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:13,625
Captain, we are being hailed
by the alien vessel.

680
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,542
On screen.

681
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:19,458
Explain yourself, Picard.

682
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:22,083
The explanation is simple.

683
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:24,959
Your attempt to capture
our ship has failed.

684
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:29,250
Release us immediately
or we will open fire.

685
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,250
Tactical analysis,
Mr. Worf.

686
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:36,458
Their weapons systems are
substantially inferior to ours.

687
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,583
They are not a threat.

688
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,625
Get her off the screen.

689
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,709
I can't believe what
we were about to do.

690
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,875
Data, we deactivated you.

691
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:53,125
I managed to reconnect
his positronic matrix.

692
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,125
DATA:
Wesley's subsequent diversions

693
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,750
gave me adequate time
to modify the palm beacon.

694
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,166
The optical burst patterns
we programmed

695
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,000
were successful
in counteracting

696
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,875
the addictive effects
of the game.

697
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:05,041
And the rest of the crew?

698
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:06,375
We programmed
the main computer

699
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,792
to transmit the same
optical burst

700
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,750
to all display screens,
stations, and terminals
throughout the ship.

701
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,375
That should reach
almost everyone.

702
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,125
Take a medical team
to treat the rest.
Aye, sir.

703
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:20,041
We'll take the alien ship to
the nearest Federation Starbase.

704
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:22,333
Ensign, lay in a course.

705
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45212.1:</i>

706
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:30,667
<i>We have delivered the Ktarian</i>
<i>vessel to Starbase 82</i>

707
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,625
<i>and are now on a course</i>
<i>to rendezvous</i>

708
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,333
<i>with the starship</i> Merrimac,

709
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:36,583
<i>which will transport</i>
<i>Wesley Crusher</i>

710
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,792
<i>back to Starfleet Academy.</i>

711
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:40,875
I never saw you
wear these.

712
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:43,125
Afraid someone might
see your birthmark?

713
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:48,750
Now I wonder who started
that birthmark rumor.

714
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,333
I wish you
didn't have to go.

715
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,041
Me, too.

716
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:05,625
You'll write,
won't you?

717
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,291
Somebody has to kill
all those rumors

718
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:09,166
you keep hearing about me.

719
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,917
RIKER: Mr. Crusher, we've
rendezvoused with the<i> Merrimac.</i>

720
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:19,041
Please report
to Transporter Room Two.

721
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:27,417
On my way, sir.

722
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:31,875
I got to go.

723
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:46,875
Here.

724
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,166
A gift.

725
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:49,750
So you'll remember.

726
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:53,500
Robin's laws,
all 102 of them.

727
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,458
Thanks.

728
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,667
Law 103?

729
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:07,709
Yes?

730
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:13,792
A couple of light years
can't keep good friends apart.

731
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,000
Bye.
