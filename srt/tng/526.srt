00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:05,959
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45959.1.</i>

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,500
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has</i>
<i>been recalled</i>

3
00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:10,542
<i>to Sector 001</i>
<i>on a priority mission.</i>

4
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:13,041
<i>All we've been told is that</i>
<i>evidence has been discovered</i>

5
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,500
<i>indicating the presence</i>
<i>of extraterrestrials on Earth</i>

6
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:18,417
<i>five centuries ago.</i>

7
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,375
Work crews were down here
installing seismic regulators

8
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:24,041
when they found some
remarkable artifacts.

9
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,667
And it's been determined
that they date back

10
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:26,792
to the late
19th century?

11
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,709
Yes.

12
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,041
Ahh.

13
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,625
DATA:
The bifocal visual aid

14
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:34,834
is typical of the era.

15
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:41,208
The weapon is a .45 caliber
double-action cavalry pistol

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,834
invented by
Colt Firearms

17
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,291
in 1873.

18
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,041
Here, look
inside the watch.

19
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,959
PICARD:
Hmm.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,875
What makes you think
that extraterrestrials

21
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:58,625
are related to
these discoveries?

22
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:01,291
The crew was having a problem
with the regulators.

23
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,959
Something inside
the cavern was

24
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,041
interfering with
the phase conditioners.

25
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,375
It turned out to be
the cavern itself.

26
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,875
The composition
of the rock face

27
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:20,875
has been altered by exposure
to triolic waves.

28
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,750
Which you're not going
to find on Earth

29
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:25,792
in either the 19th
or 24th century.

30
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:27,375
Triolic waves?

31
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:29,250
The by-product
of an energy source

32
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,917
employed by very
few species

33
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,458
because of its deleterious
effect on living tissue.

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,417
We've confirmed
that no one has been

35
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,959
in or out of this cavern
in centuries.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,083
So we're left with
a 500-year-old mystery.

37
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,917
I'm curious,
Doctor.

38
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,375
There are far greater
experts on Earth

39
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:47,375
to investigate
your mystery.

40
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:49,709
Why bring the<i> Enterprise</i>
all the way home?

41
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,709
As we continued
our excavation,

42
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,125
we found one other thing
I haven't shown you yet.

43
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:58,250
We've tried to leave
everything as we found it.

44
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,583
(<i> fabric rustles</i> )

45
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,709
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

46
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,000
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

47
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,583
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

48
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,583
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

49
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:55,041
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

50
00:02:55,083 --> 00:03:00,166
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

51
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,500
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45960.2.</i>

52
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,333
<i>We have transported</i>
<i>the materials</i>

53
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,083
<i>discovered in the cavern</i>
<i>back to the ship for analysis.</i>

54
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,458
<i>I wish I could be</i>
<i>as dispassionate</i>

55
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,250
<i>about the implications</i>
<i>as my second officer.</i>

56
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,250
DATA:
Interesting.

57
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,917
There is a 12%
decomposition of bitanium

58
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,166
in the neural
pathway links.

59
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,834
That suggests that
the alloys are vulnerable...

60
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,291
Data, how can you
look inside that--

61
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,208
analyze
the decomposition

62
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,417
without...?

63
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,500
Emotion, sir?
Yes.

64
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:29,792
I am simply trying to make
an objective assessment.

65
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,125
Data, is this yours?

66
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,166
I believe so, sir.

67
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,166
Could it be Lore?

68
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,166
No, sir. My brother's
positronic brain has

69
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,417
a Type-L phase-
discriminating amplifier.

70
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,834
Mine is a Type-R.

71
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,625
Type R?
Yes, sir.

72
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,583
Can you predict how long
this has been in the cavern?

73
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,834
Decomposition
strongly indicates

74
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,083
that life was terminated
approximately 500 years ago.

75
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,333
That would be
consistent with

76
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,041
the other artifacts
we recovered.

77
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,000
Your head is not
an artifact.

78
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,291
In relative terms,
perhaps not.

79
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,000
Nevertheless,
it seems clear that

80
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,333
that my life is to end
in the late 19th century.

81
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,709
Not if we can help it.

82
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,083
There is no way anyone
can prevent it, sir.

83
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,458
At some future date,
I will be transported

84
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,917
back to 19th-century Earth,
where I will die.

85
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,750
It has occurred.

86
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:18,000
It will occur.

87
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,709
LA FORGE:
Well, I can't tell you exactly

88
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,291
who the aliens were,
but I have found out

89
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,208
a few things.

90
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,667
The triolicized
rock face tells us

91
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,917
that we're probably
dealing with a species

92
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,333
with microcentrum
cell membranes.

93
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,750
Triolic waves
wouldn't harm them.

94
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:40,417
It also might mean they're
shape-shifters of some kind.

95
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,250
So they could have appeared
on Earth as humans.

96
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,917
I don't think it's anybody
we've ever run into before.

97
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,959
Nothing we've found matches up
with any known life-forms.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,166
What does match up

99
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,583
is a cellular fossil

100
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,792
which might have been
along just for the ride.

101
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,667
A cellular fossil?

102
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:58,333
A microscopic
ciliated life-form,

103
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,250
not unlike a thousand other
single cell life-forms

104
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,917
you'd find on
any planet surface.

105
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,542
Except this
particular one

106
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:07,250
is LB10445,

107
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:11,000
and LB10445 is only known
to exist on one place--

108
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,875
Devidia Two
in the Marrab sector.

109
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,208
Number One,
lay in a course.

110
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,917
On my way.

111
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,750
So, do you want
to talk about it?

112
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,875
Are you referring
to the foreknowledge

113
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,125
of my death?

114
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,625
Yeah.

115
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,834
I have no particular desire
to discuss the matter.

116
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,375
Do you need
to talk about it?

117
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:46,208
Yeah.
Ahh. Why?

118
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,125
Data, this has got
to bother you a little.

119
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,208
On the contrary,
I find it rather comforting.

120
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,834
Comforting?

121
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,125
I have often wondered
about my own mortality

122
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,917
as I have seen others
around me age.

123
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,333
Until now, it has been
theoretically possible

124
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,417
that I would live
an unlimited period of time,

125
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,875
and although some might
find this attractive,

126
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:07,625
to me it only
reinforces the fact

127
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,709
that I am...
artificial.

128
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,375
I never knew how tough
this must be for you.

129
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:16,083
Tough?
As in difficult?

130
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:20,375
Knowing that you would
outlive all your friends.

131
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,875
I expected to make
new friends.

132
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:24,875
True.

133
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:28,375
And then to outlive
them as well.

134
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:30,583
Now that you know
that you might not?

135
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,834
It provides a sense
of completion to my future.

136
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,333
In a way, I am
not that different

137
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,834
from anyone else.

138
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,750
I can now look
forward to death.

139
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,250
I never thought of it
that way.

140
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,959
One might also conclude

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,333
that it brings me one step
closer to being human.

142
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,667
I am mortal.

143
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:50,083
PICARD:
Picard to bridge officers.

144
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,375
We're approaching
the Devidia system.

145
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:54,000
Report
to your stations.

146
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,792
I'll see you later.
Let's get together

147
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:57,792
for a game of chess
or something, okay?

148
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:03,208
That sounded like
a very intense discussion.

149
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,750
Yeah...

150
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,542
they found Data's head
a mile beneath San Francisco.

151
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,834
Been down there
about five centuries.

152
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:14,166
That's why the<i> Enterprise</i>
is being sent back to Earth.

153
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,583
I didn't realize.

154
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,458
Something, isn't it?

155
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,041
He seems fine about it.

156
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,709
Better than I am.

157
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,041
Well, I'd better
get to Engineering.

158
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,291
Full circle.

159
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,125
Hmm.

160
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,542
I heard about Data.

161
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Yeah.

162
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:40,792
It's having an unusually
traumatic effect on everyone.

163
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,291
Yeah.

164
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,542
If you don't want to talk
about it, it's okay.

165
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,625
I'm fine,
I'm just...

166
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,792
Angry.
I'm not angry.

167
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:53,250
Yeah, I'm angry.

168
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,041
Why should I be angry?

169
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,875
Maybe because it reminds us
of our own mortality.

170
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,583
I just don't want
to believe it.

171
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,458
Have you ever heard Data
define friendship?

172
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,041
No.

173
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,208
How did he put it?

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,500
(<i> imitating Data</i> ):
As I experience certain

175
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:16,333
sensory input patterns,
my mental pathways

176
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,792
become accustomed
to them.

177
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,792
The inputs eventually
are anticipated

178
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:22,750
and even missed
when absent.

179
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,500
So what's the point?

180
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:26,709
He's used to us,

181
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,333
and we're used to him.

182
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,208
It's like finding out
someone you love

183
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,000
has a terminal
illness...

184
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,000
Data.

185
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,083
Counselor.
Commander.

186
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,250
Would either of you mind
if I made a personal inquiry?

187
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:53,166
Personal inquiry?
No, go right ahead.

188
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,375
I am perceiving
an apparent change

189
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:57,792
in the way others
behave toward me.

190
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,208
For example,

191
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,166
people abruptly end
conversations

192
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,917
when I appear,
just as you did

193
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,959
when the turbolift
doors opened.

194
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,333
Is that
an accurate observation?

195
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,125
Not at all--
Yes.

196
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,041
Yes.

197
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,208
You're right, Data.

198
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,250
And it's not
a very nice thing to do.

199
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,083
It's just that
our mental pathways

200
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,625
have become
accustomed

201
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:23,208
to your sensory
input patterns.

202
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,667
Hmm.
I understand.

203
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,917
I am also fond of you,
Commander,

204
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,458
and you as well,
Counselor.

205
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,291
We're in orbit.

206
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,542
Any sign of life?

207
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,709
WORF:
Negative, sir.

208
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,917
Captain, sensors
are picking up

209
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,333
an unusual
temporal disturbance

210
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,000
on a small area of
the planet's surface.

211
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,917
42 degrees...

212
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,250
seven minutes north
by 88 degrees,

213
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,000
declination east.

214
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,542
Temporal
disturbance?

215
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,792
Put us in the standard orbit
above those coordinates.

216
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:13,709
Spectral analysis shows
a high level of triolic waves

217
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,458
emanating from
the same location.

218
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,834
Any correlation
with the readings

219
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,250
we received
from Earth?

220
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,208
Affirmative, sir.
The magnetic signature

221
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,166
is identical to the one
found in the cavern.

222
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,125
Could those triolic waves
be dangerous for humanoids?

223
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,834
Only with
long-term exposure, sir.

224
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,125
There is no
immediate threat.

225
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,083
Take an away team.

226
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,667
Worf, Geordi, Troi,

227
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:30,792
join me in
Transporter Room Three

228
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:32,417
for an away team.

229
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,500
Commander?
Mr. Data.

230
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,917
I'll need your help
to monitor the sensor readings

231
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,959
during this
investigation.

232
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,500
Captain...

233
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:45,667
may I speak
to you alone?

234
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,417
Sir, it is
standard procedure

235
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,208
that the second officer
accompany the away team.

236
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,875
Yes, yes, Mr. Data,
I am aware of that.

237
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:02,250
Then I must assume
your decision is related

238
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,417
to the discovery
on Earth...

239
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,667
I think
it is reasonable

240
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:06,125
to take precautions.

241
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,542
Captain...

242
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,792
there is no rational
justification for this course.

243
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,500
Then I'll be
irrational.

244
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,875
It is possible, sir,

245
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,208
that the events
leading to my death

246
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,834
will not occur for years,
even centuries.

247
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,750
I hope that's true,
Mr. Data.

248
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,709
Nevertheless,
this investigation

249
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,542
began with your death.

250
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,208
I'm simply trying to see
that it doesn't end that way.

251
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,500
I appreciate your
concern, Captain,

252
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,792
but to employ an aphorism,
one cannot "cheat fate."

253
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,583
Cheat fate?

254
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,750
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

255
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,834
Perhaps we can't,
Mr. Data,

256
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,333
but at least
we can give it a try.

257
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,166
Hmm...

258
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,083
The concentration
of triolic waves

259
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,709
falls off about here.

260
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,125
Mm-hmm.

261
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,625
It increases exponentially
the closer in we go.

262
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:24,250
What's the source--
something underground?

263
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,583
Negative,
Commander.

264
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,625
What's the explanation?

265
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:27,875
I don't have one yet.

266
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,125
La Forge to<i> Enterprise.</i>

267
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,375
DATA:
Go ahead.

268
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:31,583
Data, run
a spectral field

269
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,959
correlation for me,
let's find out if

270
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,542
these triolic readings
are in any way related

271
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,250
to the temporal
distortions.

272
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,250
Acknowledged.

273
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,834
Deanna?

274
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,083
There's life here.

275
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:52,959
A child...

276
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,458
an old woman...

277
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,250
dozens more,
hundreds.

278
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,166
Terrified.

279
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,125
Terrified?

280
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,709
My God, Will,
they're human.

281
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,709
RIKER:
Whatever they are,

282
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,250
Troi's convinced
they're human.

283
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,792
They may be
trapped somehow.

284
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,125
We're not sure.

285
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,417
Captain, the results

286
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,250
of my temporal analysis
may be pertinent.

287
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,583
Go ahead.

288
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,917
Geordi, it indicates
a synchronic distortion

289
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,375
in the areas emanating
triolic waves.

290
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,959
Well, that explains
a few things-- how much, Data?

291
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,709
A positive
displacement of .004%.

292
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,250
Well, whatever
or whoever is there,

293
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,375
we're out of phase with it
but we're only talking

294
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,875
by a fraction
of a second.

295
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,667
A fraction of a second
would make them invisible?

296
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,959
A millisecond, a year--
it wouldn't make any difference.

297
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,667
If what
we're reading is true,

298
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:56,125
then we're occupying
the same space

299
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,792
but in a different time.

300
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:58,959
How do we
compensate?

301
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,291
DATA: Commander,
we might be able

302
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,875
to manipulate
the synchronic distortion.

303
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,333
LA FORGE:
Maybe, if we were

304
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,542
to create a contained
subspace force field.

305
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,583
But to get
a .004 variance,

306
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,083
we'd need an incredibly
sensitive

307
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,583
phase discriminator, Data.

308
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,875
I don't think
we have one that would

309
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,000
even come close.

310
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,750
Yes, we do.
It is built into

311
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:18,083
my positronic
decompiler.

312
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,959
It will be necessary
for me to join

313
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,333
the away team, sir.

314
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,709
Proceed, Mr. Data.

315
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:43,375
Mr. Data.

316
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,709
Sir.

317
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,750
Let me give you
a hand with that, Data.

318
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,792
Once I have adjusted
the force field,

319
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,083
I will no longer be
visible, Commander.

320
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,667
I have taken steps,
however, to ensure

321
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:54,500
that you will still
be able to hear me.

322
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:56,667
If you will assist me
in a test of the com system.

323
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,333
My voice will be
transmitted

324
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,125
on a delay correlated
to the phase adjustment.

325
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,625
That should allow me
to maintain verbal contact.

326
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,333
Will we be able
to talk to you?

327
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,041
No, sir, that will
not be possible.

328
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,333
The subspace field
has been established.

329
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,792
You're set
to go, Data.

330
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,333
Adjusting the synchronic
distortion.

331
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,750
.001...

332
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:25,542
.002.

333
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,750
.003...

334
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:30,208
.004.

335
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,125
DATA (<i> distorted</i> ):
I have made visual contact.

336
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,083
There are
life-forms here.

337
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,250
They are either
unaware of me

338
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,959
or choosing
to ignore me.

339
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,333
I am moving approximately
ten meters north

340
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,250
of my starting position
to observe more closely.

341
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,417
They range from
two to three meters in height,

342
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,500
silver-gray
in color.

343
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:57,083
They have four limbs.

344
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,917
No eyes or ears are
noticeable.

345
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,667
There is a single orifice
where a humanoid forehead

346
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:04,000
would ordinarily be.

347
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,417
They are reclined
against the rock face,

348
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,917
surrounding an apparatus
of some sort

349
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,125
approximately
1.5 meters in height.

350
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,917
It is releasing what appear
to be energy fragments

351
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,625
which are then
ingested by the entities

352
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,875
through the orifice,

353
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:20,834
perhaps some sort
of nourishment.

354
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,583
The upper portion
of the apparatus

355
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,709
seems to be a holding facility
for the energy segments.

356
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,917
There are hundreds,
perhaps thousands

357
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,917

00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,417
I have resumed
a northerly direction.

359
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,000
There is no evidence yet
of humans.

360
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,208
Okay, that's enough,
Data, come on back now.

361
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,667
I have encountered
another life-form--

362
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:46,375
an ophidian.

363
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:49,208
It seems to be restricted
by a force field.

364
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,417
Two of the silver-gray entities
are approaching it.

365
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,125
They have released
the force field.

369
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:04,375

00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,458

Excuse me.

Uh, pardon me.

380
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,834
I am searching
for two individuals

00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,834

00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,834

00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,458
Hmm.

386
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,542
Could you help out
a '49er?

387
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,834
I-I-I fell down
a shaft.

388
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,041
I got blown up
in a tunnel.

389
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,333
That is
unfortunate.

390
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,041
It is most
unfortunate.

391
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,750
I require large amounts
of whiskey as a liniment.

392
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:51,542
I am sorry, but I have
no whiskey to give you.

393
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,625
I'll take a dime.

394
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:56,333
I am sorry, but I have
no form of legal tender.

395
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,500
Oh. We're in
the same boat, huh?

396
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:02,458
Well, this is
my street.

397
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,417
You'll have to go
find one of your own.

398
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,041
I would be
happy to do so,

Oh.

401
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,375

402
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:16,417
Don't even
bother to ask.

403
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,083
Your best handout

404
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,291
is from a young fella
with his lady.

405
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,166
You give him a chance
to show her he's generous.

406
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,000
Steer clear
of sailors.

407
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,709
Most likely,
you'll get a...

for your trouble.

409
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,333
Thank you for
your advice,

You are in need
of medical attention.

418
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,208
I will get a doctor.

419
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,208
No, no, no.
It's too late for that.

420

Sir, I need
temporary lodging.

428
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,959
Looks like the missus
booted you out

429
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,542
in the middle
of the night.

430
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,542
Ahh, I understand the source
of your misperception.

431
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,208
However, this is
not sleepwear,

432
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,041
and I do not
have a missus.

433
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,125
Well...

434
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,792
I am a Frenchman.

435
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:42,500
Oh, well, everybody's
from somewhere.

436
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,375
Now, that doesn't
matter at this hotel.

437
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:47,375
It's six bits a day
or four dollars a week.

438
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:48,709
I have no money.

439
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,125
Well, now<i> that</i> matters.

440
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,875
But I am capable
of performing

00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,000
significant tasks

442
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,083
both mental
and physical.

443
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,583
Perhaps your hotel
would offer me a job.

444
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,125
Geez,
I don't know.

445
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,333
We're pretty happy
with the maid we've got.

he gets here on time--

449

00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,625

You might want
some company.

I can introduce you
to... Lillian.

for companionship.

Well, this stuff's

to be cheap.

00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:14,667
Done.

538
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,834
Help out a '49er...

539
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:29,125
Fell down...

540
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,875
a shaft.

541
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:36,792
'49er...

542
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,291
help me.

543
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:46,500
(<i> wheezing</i> )

544
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:51,208
Help me out.

545
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,959
No...

546
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,375
No!

547
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,583
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

548
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,417
<i>Close-range sensor analysis</i>

549
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:23,125
<i>has yielded no further trace</i>
<i>of Commander Data.</i>

550
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:26,500
<i>Despite the emotional</i>

551
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:28,500
<i>I must move</i>

552
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,125
I'm not willing
to accept that he's dead

553
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,375
and just leave it
at that.

554
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,542
We cannot make
Mr. Data our priority.

555
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,417
What is more important
than Data?

556
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:37,375
Look at what
we have so far--

557
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:38,667
evidence that these aliens

558
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:41,250
have been traveling
in time to Earth.

559
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,917
What if they're
trying to undermine

560
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,667
our history
for some reason?

561
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,667
Some kind of guerrilla war?

562
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:49,041
We must assume that
there is a threat.

563
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,750
If not to us, then
to 19th-century Earth.

564
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,625
We have to determine
what that threat may be.

565
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:55,417
Mr. La Forge, we have
to find some way

566
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,333
to communicate
with these life-forms.

567
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,125
It's not going to be easy
to reproduce what Data did.

568
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,500
We can create
a contained subspace field,

569
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:04,041
but we'd need
an extraordinarily

570
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,750
sensitive phase
discriminator to get

571
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,417
that .004 variance.

572
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:08,458
Can you build one?

573
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

574
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:12,333
Won't be
as good as Data's.

575
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:13,834
Will it be good enough?

576
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,250
I don't know.
I can try.

577
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,792
It's gonna take
some time, though.

578
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:19,000
I don't want anyone else
going in alone.

579
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:20,709
I can probably
create a large enough

580
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,792
subspace field
to encompass everyone.

581
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,166
But adjusting the phase
inside the field,

582
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,667
that's gonna be
the hard part.

583
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:28,250
Make it so.

584
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,959
We have to assume
one thing, sir.

585
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Wherever Data may be,

586
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,333
he's doing
the same thing we are,

587
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:36,125
which is trying to get
to the bottom of this.

588
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:38,041
He may have a better idea about
what's going on than we do.

589
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,375
So it might be
in the best interest

590
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,208
of this mission
to find him.

591
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,583
Perhaps in the course of
this investigation we will.

592
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,375
I hope so.

593
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,041
If we find
Commander Data,

594
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:51,834
it may be our fate to die
with him in the past.

595
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:54,166
If our remains are
in that cavern,

596
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:56,750
they would have
turned to dust long ago.

597
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:07,333
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

598
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,500
PICARD:
I'm afraid to interrupt.

599
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:16,083
Captain...

600
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,500
you didn't have to come
all the way down here.

601
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:18,792
I would have been
more than happy

602
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:20,250
to have come up to you.

603
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,709
And miss all this?

604
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,959
I haven't seen such
a complex operation

605
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,208
since the Academy
lab final in exochemistry.

606
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,875
It's a Tzartak
aperitif.

607
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:33,500
It's very,
very touchy.

608
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:36,166
The trick is to change
the evaporation point

609
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,792
of the main ingredient.

610
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:40,166
You want the temperature
where the liquid goes to vapor

611
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:41,959
to be a half
a degree below

612
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,709
the body temperature
of the customer.

613
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,000
That way,

614
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,792
when the liquid
touches the tongue,

615
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:49,125
it evaporates,
and the flavor is

616
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,417
carried entirely
by the vapor.

617
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,250
A few molecules off,

618
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,083
the vapor point crashes,
and poof-- it's all gone.

619
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,625
All of it.

620
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:03,208
What is it you wanted
to see me about?

621
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,333
I hear you're sending
an away team

622
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,083
down to the surface.

623
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:08,375
Uh-huh.

624
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:10,208
Are you going?

625
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,667
Well, now, this is
rather unusual.

626
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:16,917
For you to be curious
about an away mission.

627
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:20,291
Maybe it's an unusual
away mission.

628
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,750
If you have something
to say, I'm listening.

629
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:28,792
Starfleet captains don't
usually accompany away teams.

630
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,709
It's general policy.

631
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,250
This time you have to.

632
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,291
Why?

633
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,834
You just do.

634
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:47,166
Do you remember
the first time we met?

635
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,959
Of course.

636
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,917
Don't be so sure.

637
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,542
I just mean...

638
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:57,583
if you don't go
on this mission...

639
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:03,583
we'll never meet.

640
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,375
(<i> machinery whirring</i> )

641
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,834
(<i> thumping</i> )

642
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:31,875
Ugh-- oh, whoo.

643
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,500
Sorry it took
so long, Mr. Data.

644
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:36,500
An apology is
not necessary.

645
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:38,834
Whoo.

646
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,458
Whoa... hey...

647
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:42,542
Ow.

648
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,166
Are you all right?

649
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:46,333
I believe I have
overexerted myself.

650
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,792
Yeah, I'll say.

651
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,000
Did you get it
working?

652
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,125
Yes.

653
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,792
Whatever it is.

654
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,875
This is for
your trouble.

655
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:58,083
What are you going
to do with the anvil?

656
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,792
I require a low-intensity
magnetic field core.

657
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:04,750
I believe the iron mass
of the anvil will provide that.

658
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,959
Well, uh,
what's it gonna be

659
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,083
when it's finished?

660
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:11,500
What do you think it is...
gonna be?

661
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,125
If I were to guess?

662
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,917
Maybe a, uh,
a new kind of motor

663
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,875
for one of those
horseless carriages.

664
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,709
That is a good guess.

665
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,166
Hot damn.

666
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,917
You really think there's
money in those things?

667
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:25,333
Perhaps.

668
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,917
Hah!

669
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:29,125
Isn't that what
makes America great?

670
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,583
To what are you
referring?

671
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:33,208
Well, a man rides
into town in his pajamas,

672
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,125
wins a grub stake
at a poker table,

673
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:36,750
turns it into
a horseless carriage,

674
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:40,625
and makes a million bucks?
That's America.

675
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,542
I believe I have given you
an erroneous impression.

676
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,667
You know, someday...

677
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:48,000
my ship's gonna come in.

678
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,291
You have a ship?

679
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,625
Oh, yeah, and it's
full of gold, too.

680
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:53,875
I'm just biding my time
till it gets here,

681
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:56,583
raising a stake
any way I can.

682
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:59,959
I've been a newsie,
cut fish at a cannery.

683
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,667
Heck, I've even been
an oyster pirate.

684
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:04,625
You have had a considerable
spectrum of occupations.

685
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,875
Yeah, well, you can't stay
in one place too long.

686
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:08,959
I'm always looking
for the angle, you know.

687
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,709
Say, maybe you and I could
go into business together,

688
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,583
selling your horseless
carriage and all.

689
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,208
You invent 'em,
I sell 'em.

690
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,500
I can sell
anybody anything.

691
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,250
What do you say?

692
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:26,583
I believe your plan is
a bit premature.

693
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:30,250
Well, keep it
in mind, though.

694
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:32,917
I better get back.

695
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:37,583
Oh, I forgot.

696
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,458
I got you something
at the bakery on Third.

697
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,625
Oh.

698
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:41,750
Thank you, Jack.

699
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,041
Oh, no, no, no.

700
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:45,333
It's on me...
partner.

701
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,583
MAN:
The eminent scientist

702
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,667
Alfred Russell Wallace

703
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:13,542
has revived
the theory

704
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:17,542
that Earth is at the center
of the stellar universe.

705
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:20,125
(<i> genteel laughter</i> )

706
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:24,792
This, uh...

philosopher...

710
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:35,000
has, uh,
reaffirmed our planet

711
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:39,959
as the only habitable globe
in the heavens.

712
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,417
A world, furthermore

713
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:45,542
constructed for
the sole benefit of man.

714
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,333
Hmm.

715
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,709
He's got a lot of folks

My dear,
Mr. Clemens,

why do I think you're
not one of them?

718
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,250
Your suspicions,
Madame Guinan,

719
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,875
are undoubtedly
based upon

720
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:03,333
your keen
observational skills.

721

Now, if you'll
permit me,

723
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:12,000
I'll continue my character
assassination unimpeded.

724
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:16,500
My dear, Mr. Clemens,
please do, please do.

725
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:19,458
According to our best
geologic estimate,

726
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,750
the earth is approximately
100 million years of age.

727
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:26,166
Perhaps it is less,
perhaps more.

728
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,041
Perhaps
a great deal more.

729
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,500
Indeed.

730
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,917
But regardless,
it is ancient...

731
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:35,291
in the extreme.

732
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,250
Now, geology also
tells us

733
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:40,041
that man himself

734
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:43,083
has existed but for
a microscopic fraction

735
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,834

That the world got by

Quite my point.
