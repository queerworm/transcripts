1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:11,041
We are approaching
Starbase 179, sir.

2
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:13,083
Half impulse, Mr. Crusher.

3
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:15,041
Going to half impulse.

4
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,834
Captain, this is the Bridge.

5
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,083
We've arrived at Starbase 179.

6
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,875
PICARD:
Acknowledged, Number One.

7
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:23,291
Establish position
090-mark-345

8
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,625
at 27,000
kilometers.

9
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,625
Hailing
frequencies.

10
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:28,917
Open.

11
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:31,834
Starbase 179,
this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

12
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,917
<i>Enterprise,</i>
this is Starbase 179.

13
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:35,959
We are ready for transfer
on your mark.

14
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:37,375
Thank you.

15
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,709
Commander Data,
you have the Bridge.

16
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:40,083
Ensign Crusher,
you're with me.

17
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:59,458
Starbase 179, we are ready
to commence transfer.

18
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,750
Acknowledge,<i> Enterprise.</i>

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,875
Begin transfer.

20
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,625
Welcome aboard
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

21
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,083
I'm Commander William Riker,
your First Officer.

22
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,583
Those of you who are here
as replacements

23
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,166
can step outside
and follow Lieutenant Lewis.

24
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,458
He will assign you
to your crew quarters.

25
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:24,000
Ensign, you are here
on the exchange program.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,041
If you would just
follow Mr. Crusher.

27
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,834
Mordock, what are
you doing here?

28
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:29,250
You couldn't
have graduated

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,875
the academy already.

30
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,041
I am not Mordock.

31
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,250
I am Mendon.

32
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,083
Ensign Mendon from
the planet Benzar.

33
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,291
Sorry.

34
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,625
It's a friend of mine.

35
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,583
You look
just like him.

36
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,291
We are from the same
geostructure.

37
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,083
Naturally, we look alike.

38
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,250
How do you tell
each other apart?

39
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:51,041
We just do.

40
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:54,125
It's nice to have you here,
Ensign.

41
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,834
There will be
a briefing

42
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:57,959
and indoctrination session
in 15 minutes.

43
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,375
I want to tell you
how happy I am

44
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,667
to be assigned
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

45
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:03,959
It wasn't just luck.

46
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,291
I requested it.

47
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,458
I know I can be of great help
to the ship.

48
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,667
Yes, of course.

49
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,667
If you'll just
follow Mr. Crusher.

50
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,500
Yes, sir.

51
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:18,291
(<i> chuckling</i> )

52
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,583
PICARD:
Commander Riker,

53
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,375
report to the phaser range,
please.

54
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,959
On my way.

55
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,500
(<i> targets beeping,</i>
<i>shots whooshing</i> )

56
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:35,083
PICARD:
I was wondering if
you had any feelings

57
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,250
about the officer
exchange program

58
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,583
initiated by
Starfleet Command.

59
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,166
Just positive ones, sir.

60
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,583
Actually, I just welcomed
Ensign Mendon onboard.

61
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,000
He certainly seems
eager to please.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,917
Well, that's
a Benzite trait.

63
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,834
It's been suggested
that an officer
from the<i> Enterprise</i>

64
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:58,125
might participate
in the program.

65
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,458
That's probably a good idea.

66
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:05,083
Well, there is
a Klingon vessel
in the area.

67
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:11,041
I don't recall hearing
of a Federation officer

68
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,667
ever serving
on a Klingon vessel.

69
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:16,125
No, no, neither have I.

70
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,000
It might prove
to be beneficial.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,333
Well, having Worf onboard
certainly has been.

72
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,667
Yes, sir.

73
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:26,417
Who did you intend to send, sir?

74
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,959
I thought of asking
for a volunteer.

75
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,375
I might be interested, sir.

76
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,542
Damn.

77
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:33,542
Sorry, Number One,
what was that?

78
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:36,250
I said I wouldn't mind
the assignment, sir.

79
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,875
Any particular reason?

80
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:43,375
Because nobody has ever
done it before.

81
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,625
Well, I'll inform Starbase
of your acceptance.

82
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,166
They'll contact
the Klingon vessel,

83
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,917
make the arrangements.

84
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:17,000
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,959
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

86
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,834
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

87
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:26,875

<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42506.5.</i>

91
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,625
<i>We have departed</i>
<i>from Starbase 179</i>

92
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,792

<i>of Commander Riker's</i>
<i>temporary assignment.</i>

95
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,041
I've studied, and know
everything about my heritage.

96
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,709
Then you're just the person
I need to talk to

97
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,125
to clear something up.

98
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,959
It's been my understanding
that one of the duties

99
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,709
of the First Officer
of the Klingon vessel

100
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:58,917
is to assassinate
his Captain?

101
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,041
Wouldn't that
bring about chaos?

103
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,250
Of course not.

104
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,917
See, when and if the
Captain becomes weak

105
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,542
or unable to perform,

106
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:09,417
it is expected that
his honorable retirement

107
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,709
should be assisted
by his "First."

108
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,959
Your Second Officer
will assassinate you

109
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,792
for the same reasons.

110
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,458
That method of attrition must
take a little getting used to.

111
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,208
The Klingon system has
operated successfully

112
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,417
for centuries.

113
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,166
It is different.

114
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,750
Many things will
be different.

115
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,291
Can I help you, sir?

116
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,875
That's a wonderful method
of maintaining

117
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,083
a constant control factor
over defensive shields,

118
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,709
but I'm sure there's a way

119
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,208
to improve
response time.

120
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,667
Sorry.

121
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:13,125
Didn't mean to interrupt you.

122
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,083
Just thought
I could be of some help.

123
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:19,500
However, I am correct
in what I said.

124
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,500
That is superb designing,
absolutely first-rate.

125
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,834
Yes, it is.

126
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,667
Would you care to be
more specific?

127
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,417
The input sampling.

128
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:44,834
It's simple, yet
efficient enough.

129
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:47,083
Of course, a minor change
of the helm readout

130
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,000
would be much
more helpful

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,750
in emergency
situations.

132
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,583
We've never had
any problems with it.

133
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,250
Have you seen it work?

134
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,125
Not in a practical exercise,
but in theory.

135
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,166
My theory-- it would be more
than a marginal improvement.

136
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,959
I'll have
to mention this

137
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,458
to the Captain.

138
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:08,375
He is open to some astute
observations, isn't he?

139
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,000
I've never known the Captain

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,125
not to listen
to one of his officers.

141
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,500
Outstanding.

142
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,875
Soon, we'll get things
running perfectly.

143
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,125
What is that?

144
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,125
It's a Klingon delicacy.

145
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,750
<i>Pipius</i> claw.

146
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,375
This is heart of<i> targ.</i>

147
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,959
This, of course, is<i> gagh.</i>

148
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,083
<i>Gagh?</i>

149
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,417
Yes, serpent worms.

150
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:48,709
Would you like some?

151
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:49,834
No, thanks.

152
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:51,291
I've never heard of a Klingon

153
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,625
starving to death
on his own vessel,

154
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,709
but you might.

155
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:55,083
Not if I weaken first.

156
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,542
I know all about that.

157
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:58,250
Their beliefs
are rather brutal,

158
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,417
but usually what kills us
kills them.

159
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,959
Well, that's certainly
good to know.

160
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,500
Would you like
something to drink?

161
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,959
I'm abstaining in honor
of your last hour onboard.

162
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,917
Your sacrifice
will not go unnoticed.

163
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:15,834
Oh.

164
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:18,583
Well, I'm familiar
with the practice

165
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,208
of the feast
before the transfer.

166
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,166
I've done it
dozens of times.

167
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,792
However, I usually made
more palatable choices.

168
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:29,542
Well, these are
the more palatable choices.

169
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:31,083
Ah, thank you.

170
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,792
Hmm.

171
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,834
We know so little about them.

172
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:43,000
There really is
so much to learn.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,875
This is a great opportunity.

174
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,959
I envy you, Mr. Riker.

175
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,792
Oh!

176
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,750
Well.

177
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,625
Yeah, thank you.

178
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,709
Oh...

179
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,667
(<i> crunching</i> )

180
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,125
Mmm.

181
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,291
Commander.

182
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,750
An emergency
transponder?

183
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,667
Slightly altered to transmit
an omnidirectional signal

184
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,625
and an emergency call.

185
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,125
You suspect
trouble?

186
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,000
Simply a security
precaution.

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,709
I want to ensure your return
to<i> this</i> ship.

188
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,166
Sentiment,
Lieutenant Worf?

189
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,166
Efficiency, Commander.

190
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,834
I understand.

191
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,041
Thank you.

192
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,041
(<i> beeping</i> )

193
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,041
We have a Klingon
vessel approaching.

194
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,709
Hailing frequencies.

195
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,041
Open.

196
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,166
They are returning
our hail

197
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,792
in proper language.

198
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,166
It is the<i> Pagh.</i>

199
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,041
On viewscreen.

200
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:03,542
I'm Captain Picard
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

201
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:07,625
This is Captain Kargan
of the Klingon vessel, the<i> Pagh.</i>

202
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,000
Beam your First Officer
onboard immediately.

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,250
We are preparing to do so.

204
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,875
And, Captain, you're getting
a fine officer.

205
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,875
Thank you for your opinion,

206
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,667
but I will judge that
for myself.

207
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:22,959
Screen off.

208
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,667
Not very hospitable,
are they?

209
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,458
That is not
your concern.

210
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,709
Observe your station,
Ensign Mendon.

211
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,041
Didn't mean to offend you.

212
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,750
You didn't.

213
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,041
Yet.

214
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,542
(<i> screen beeping rhythmically)</i>

215
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,000
Transporter,
prepare to beam
Commander Riker

216
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,625
aboard the<i> Pagh.</i>

217
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,083
Acknowledged, Captain.

218
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,291
Mr. Data, you
have the Bridge.

219
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,667
DATA:
Aye, sir.

220
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,500
Good luck,
Commander.

221
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,625
Thanks, O'Brien.

222
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,500
I wouldn't
want to go.

223
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,583
Why?

224
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,667
You're not afraid, are you?

225
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,291
No, I'm not.

226
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,792
I would be.

227
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:52,375
Ready, sir.

228
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:54,834
Thanks.

229
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:56,667
Energize.

230
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,500
PICARD:
Resume course, Mr. Crusher.

231
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,333
WESLEY:
Aye, sir.

232
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,458
Take over, Commander Data.

233
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,208
I'll be in Observation.

234
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,041
Thank you, sir.

235
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,959
Sir, I am
Ensign Mendon.

236
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,542
I just wanted
to tell you

237
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,166
how pleased I am to be
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

238
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,375
Yes, of course.

239
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,792
Um...

240
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,333
good to have you aboard.

241
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,500
If you have a few minutes,

242
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,250
I've noted a few
procedural changes

243
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,500
which might speed up
operations on the Bridge.

244
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,542
I pick things up
very fast.

245
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,750
Yes, of course you do.

246
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,500
Your have an excellent record,
Ensign.

247
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,208
However, here on the<i> Enterprise,</i>
we use the chain of command.

248
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,709
You will report
your observations
to Lieutenant Worf.

249
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,125
I beg your pardon,
Captain.

250
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,000
I just wanted
to impress upon you...

251
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,959
No need to apologize, Ensign.

252
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,125
We should have explained
it better to you

253
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,625
at your indoctrination.

254
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,458
Ensign Mendon...

255
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,834
you may impress<i> me.</i>

256
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:32,625
(<i> indistinct conversations</i>
<i>in Klingon</i> )

257
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,625
Something wrong?

258
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,625
No.

259
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,917
It's just...

260
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,041
I've never seen anyone

261
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,625
of your species before.

262
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,542
I'm just your average,
everyday human being

263
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:54,333
who happens
to be a Commander.

264
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,333
Now what were
your orders?

265
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,083
To escort you
to the Captain.

266
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,250
Proceed.

267
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,875
Yes, Commander.

268
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:35,375
Commander William
Riker of the Starship
<i>Enterprise.</i>

269
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,333
That is incorrect.

270
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,291
I don't
understand.

271
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,208
You are Commander William Riker,

272
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,291
First Officer
of the Klingon Cruiser the<i> Pagh.</i>

273
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:51,625
Or do you intend to disobey
Federation orders?

274
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,041
I have no such intentions, sir.

275
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,709
Exactly where are
your loyalties, Commander?

276
00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:02,709
I'm afraid I still
don't understand, sir.

277
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:05,500
This ship is equipped
with our best weapons

278
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,125
and our finest warriors.

279
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,291
Although we're
on a peaceful mission,

280
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,750
we are ready to go
into battle instantly.

281
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,208
I know I can count on every
Klingon warrior in this crew

282
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,750
to serve and die
in that battle.

283
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,834
So I ask you again,
Commander Riker,

284
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,750
where are your loyalties?

285
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,834
I've been assigned
to serve this ship

286
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,792
and to obey
your orders.

287
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:32,041
And I will do exactly that.

288
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,625
Will you take an oath
to that effect?

289
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,250
I just did.

290
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:51,500
This is your Second Officer,
Lieutenant Klag.

291
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:54,875
Was there
something

292
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,667
you wanted to say to me,
Lieutenant?

293
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,500
Yes, sir.

294
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:08,166
I do not believe you.

295
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,917
Then I take it you challenge
my authority over you.

296
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:14,166
Correct.

297
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:18,083
And your position on this,
Captain?

298
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:23,000
I would say it is
your first command decision.

299
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,625
(<i> growls softly</i> )

300
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:02,583
My oath is between
Captain Kargan and myself.

301
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:07,166
Your only concern
is with how you obey my orders.

302
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,250
Or do you prefer
the rank of prisoner

303
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,875
to that
of Lieutenant?

304
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,041
I will take your orders.

305
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:19,750
And you, Commander Riker,
obey my orders.

306
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,709
Of course,
Captain Kargan.

307
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:38,417
Sir, automatic scan has
registered an unknown substance

308
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,125
on the aft quarter
of the exterior skin

309
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,500
of the dorsal section.

310
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,125
Target that location
and define.

311
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,375
WORF:
Aye, sir.

312
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,750
I've located it, sir.

313
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,375
The dorsal
of the Engineering section.

314
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,166
Viewscreen on.

315
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:55,041
Focus on area.

316
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:58,542
Magnification
factor ten.

317
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:01,417
Increase magnification
to 50.

318
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,834
PICARD:
Analyze.

319
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:05,875
The substance
appears to be

320
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,750
a rare form
of subatomic bacteria

321
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,709
capable of doubling itself
in size every 15 minutes.

322
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:13,792
It seems to be reacting with
two of the compounds present

323
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,542
in the<i> Enterprise</i> structure.

324
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:16,625
Origin?

325
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,208
MENDON:
Captain,

326
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,417
I noticed it when I did an
intensive scan of the<i> Pagh.</i>

327
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:24,083
The Klingon ship.

328
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,250
And whom did you inform?

329
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,542
Well, no one.

330
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,875
I have not yet completed
my full analysis.

331
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,333
You are supposed to report
whatever is out of the ordinary.

332
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,250
And I think that falls
into this category.

333
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,917
But, sir, as I said,

334
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:40,500
I've not yet completed
my full analysis.

335
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,625
It would be improper
to report it until then.

336
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,500
How did you come
to that decision?

337
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,125
It is a Benzite regulation.

338
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,542
No officer on the deck
of one of our ships

339
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:53,750
would report an occurrence
like this

340
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,125
until he had a full analysis
and a resolution.

341
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,625
I have simply followed
proper procedures.

342
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:10,625
It is our procedure, Ensign,
to notify Command

343
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:14,041
of any possible danger
to the ship.

344
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,667
The decision is not yours.

345
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,250
Do you
understand?

346
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,667
Yes, sir.

347
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,583
Now, you will continue
with your analysis

348
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,834
and determine the danger
not only to our ship

349
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:26,041
but to the Klingon vessel, also.

350
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,333
Yes, Captain.

351
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,625
That will take
a couple of hours.

352
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,875
Use whatever resources
are necessary.

353
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,834
It appears we may have
encountered a new life-form.

354
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,875
I want to know everything
about it as quickly as possible.

355
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,417
Commander Data,
supervise.

356
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:41,625
Aye, sir.

357
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:53,125
And then I will instruct you
in<i> Enterprise</i> etiquette.

358
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,625
<i>First Officer's Personal Log.</i>

359
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,834
<i>I have been aboard the</i> Pagh
<i>a short time</i>

360
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:05,458
<i>but long enough to be</i>
<i>impressed with the abilities</i>

361
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,125
<i>and single-mindedness</i>
<i>of the Klingons.</i>

362
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,875
(<i> speaking Klingon</i> )

363
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,250
Commander,

364
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,041
you're not eating very much.

365
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,834
I'm not that hungry.

366
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:42,875
Is the food
all right, Commander?

367
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,166
It's delicious.

368
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,250
The<i> pipius</i> claw was excellent.

369
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,208
I also enjoyed this<i> bregitlung.</i>

370
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,041
And the<i> rokeg</i> blood pie?

371
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,250
Delicious.

372
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,417
Good.

373
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:58,458
Then you'll also enjoy this.

374
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:02,500
Isn't that<i> gagh?</i>

375
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,041
Very good.

376
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,375
You did some research
on our nutritional choices.

377
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,625
Yes, but...

378
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,792
it's still moving.

379
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:15,959
<i>Gagh</i> is always best
when served live.

380
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,542
Would you like something easier?

381
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,333
Easier?

382
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,375
Yes.

383
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,083
If Klingon food
is too strong for you,

384
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,583
perhaps we could get
one of the females

385
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,667
to breast-feed you.

386
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,625
(<i> laughter</i> )

387
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,875
(<i> laughter</i> )

388
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,500
You're not worried
about my weakening, are you?

389
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:55,750
Look around you.

390
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,667
There are no old warriors.

391
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,625
No, sir, I'm sure
they all died with honor.

392
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,542
Exactly.

393
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:08,917
You may live long enough
to learn about us.

394
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,208
He is not very
attractive,

395
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,875
but I will have him.

396
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,583
They are inquisitive.

397
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,041
They would like to know
how you would endure.

398
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,625
Endure what?

399
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,667
Them.

400
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,250
One or both?

401
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,834
(<i> laughter</i> )

402
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:51,208
I may be back for you.

403
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,875
Is she serious?

404
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,208
Yes.

405
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:10,208
Commander, would you say

406
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:13,834
you're a typical
Federation officer?

407
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:15,208
I suppose so.

408
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,625
Why?

409
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,417
Well, it's just
you're not what I expected.

410
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,709
In what way?

411
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,667
You have a sense of humor.

412
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,667
I was thinking
the same thing about you.

413
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,709
In all my dealings
with Klingons,

414
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:27,917
including our
Lieutenant Worf,

415
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:30,041
the thought
never occurred to me

416
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,709
of Klingons laughing.

417
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:34,959
There is much about us
you do not know.

418
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,792
That's why I'm here.

419
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,625
You should ask.

420
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:39,792
I may.

421
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:40,834
After this tour,

422
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:43,333
I may have
some worthy questions.

423
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,792
Questions about what?

424
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,583
About our future?

425
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,834
Our future is honor.

426
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:53,709
Our present is
serving this ship.

427
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:55,000
Like you, I have

428
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,959
a mother
and a father.

429
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,583
They look like me.

430
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,166
I look like them.

431
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,750
Are they still alive?

432
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,667
My mother lives and my father

433
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:06,250
was killed in battle
at Tranome Sar.

434
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,208
And your father?

435
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,625
My father?

436
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:27,792
My father was captured
in battle by Romulans

437
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,500
and not allowed to die.

438
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:34,709
He eventually escaped.

439
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:36,709
Where is he now?

440
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:39,375
He is on our planet.

441
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,041
He waits.

442
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:49,750
He waits for his death.

443
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,583
He will eventually fade
of a natural illness

444
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,583
and die weakened and useless.

445
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:58,500
Honorless.

446
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,625
I will<i> not</i> see him.

447
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,834
He's your father.

448
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:09,291
A Klingon is his work,
not his family.

449
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:12,959
That is the way of things.

450
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,250
He's your father.

451
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,875
Klingons do not express feeling

452
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,709
the way you do.

453
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:25,959
Perhaps you should.

454
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:31,083
We would not know how.

455
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:40,208
Yesterday, I did not
know how to eat<i> gagh.</i>

456
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,917
MENDON:
It is confirmed

457
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,917
that the organisms feed
on some of the compounds

458
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:01,834
that make up the hull
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

459
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:03,750
And the Klingon ship, the<i> Pagh?</i>

460
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,583
They are more susceptible.

461
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,500
Their hull contains more
of the compounds.

462
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,792
Projection.

463
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,750
According to the rate
of reproduction,

464
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,875
there should be a
12-centimeter opening

465
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,667
in the Klingon hull
at this time.

466
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:19,959
Signal them at once.

467
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:21,709
They could be unaware
of their danger.

468
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,166
They may need our help.

469
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,166
Aye, sir.

470
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,291
Change course to intercept.

471
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,667
WESLEY:
Aye, sir.

472
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,583
It will take some time
to locate them, sir.

473
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,125
They are on
undesignated maneuvers

474
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,583
in the Pheben
system.

475
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,250
Find them.

476
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,875
Tell me, Commander Riker.

477
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,667
What do you make of this?

478
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,834
RIKER:
I felt no collision.

479
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:57,500
Were we hit
by a small meteor?

480
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,709
No. No collision.

481
00:27:58,709 --> 00:27:59,875
Corrosion, then?

482
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,250
No, not corrosion.

483
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,166
Science station,
analyze.

484
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:04,333
We already have

485
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,667
and fortunately
the cavity opened

486
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:07,583
onto a section
that could withstand

487
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,667
the change in pressure.

488
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:09,875
Then, what is it?

489
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,333
KLAG:
A space organism

490
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,875
eating away at our hull.

491
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,500
What are you talking about?
What is it?

492
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,333
I mean, you must have
some way to repair it.

493
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:17,542
I'm afraid not.

494
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:19,166
KLAG:
Our estimate

495
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:22,792
is that, in less than eight
hours, we will have lost

496
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:25,083
too much of our shell
to remain intact.

497
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,041
The only vessel
we've had contact with recently

498
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,667
is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

499
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,709
There was no direct contact
with the<i> Enterprise.</i>

500
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:35,291
Tactics officer,
report to Commander Riker.

501
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:38,375
The<i> Enterprise</i> did conduct
an extensive scan

502
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:40,083
of this vessel.

503
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,458
That's normal procedure.

504
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,458
What type of beam
did the<i> Enterprise</i> use

505
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,000
to cause this damage
to our hull?

506
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,125
None.

507
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,250
Why would they do that?

508
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,458
We're allies.

509
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,625
But my logs indicate

510
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:51,709
that the<i> Enterprise</i> directed

511
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:53,583
an intense
scanning beam

512
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:54,917
at this specific area

513
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:57,417
for a duration of two minutes.

514
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:59,625
Explain that.

515
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,834
I can't.

516
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:07,500
It could be a weapon.

517
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,959
It's no weapon.

518
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,792
The<i> Enterprise</i>
has no reason to do that,

519
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:12,959
especially with me onboard.

520
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,041
It makes no sense.

521
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,125
Why?

522
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:17,333
"Why" is no longer important.

523
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,750
What is important
is our response to this attack.

524
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,709
Engage cloaking device.

525
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:24,625
Change course
to intercept the<i> Enterprise.</i>

526
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:27,792
What do you intend to do,
Captain?

527
00:29:27,792 --> 00:29:28,917
Intend?

528
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,625
There is only one response.

529
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,333
I intend to attack
the<i> Enterprise</i>

530
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,625
and destroy it.

531
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,166
You're making
some progress.

532
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:02,917
You've eliminated
half the possibilities already.

533
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:06,542
Thank you, but I seem
to have become efficient

534
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:08,291
a little later than was needed.

535
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:11,041
It was my responsibility
to learn and adapt

536
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:14,625
to the<i> Enterprise's</i> 
regulations,

537
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:16,917
and I didn't do that.

538
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,709
Not really.

539
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:20,834
You just made an error.

540
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,792
Captain Picard
may not like them,

541
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:27,917
but he knows they turn up
from time to time.

542
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:29,208
I failed.

543
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,709
I had an opportunity

544
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:33,792
to show the Captain
my superior capabilities

545
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,542
and I failed.

546
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,959
I can never recover from that.

547
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:42,375
Mendon, it was a mistake.

548
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,834
You didn't put
the organism on the hull.

549
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:46,500
You discovered it.

550
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,750
You were trying to analyze it

551
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,458
and messed up
on protocol a little.

552
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,750
I realize you are trying
to be nice to me

553
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,625
and I appreciate it.

554
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:11,166
What I don't understand is why.

555
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,458
Why not?

556
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:15,208
I thought you
could use a friend.

557
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,458
Thank you.

558
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,834
I only hope
I can learn your ways

559
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,959
before I mess up again.

560
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:25,709
I imagine my methods
must seem foolish to you.

561
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:28,166
They're... different.

562
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:31,667
But that's what this exchange
program is all about.

563
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:33,667
You learn the way
we do things

564
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,542
and take that information
back to your command.

565
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:38,667
It's up to them to decide
which is better.

566
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:40,250
You're right.

567
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,000
I'll do it your way.

568
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,667
I'll work even harder
than I did before

569
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,792
and I'll succeed brilliantly.

570
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,417
What is the status?

571
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:58,166
Unchanged.

572
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,500
The rate of increase continues.

573
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,166
Commander Riker,

574
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:05,291
check the organism growth
with Engineering.

575
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:16,333
Keep him under scrutiny.

576
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:21,333
Captain, I'm not convinced

577
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:24,083
Riker knew
of any plot against us.

578
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:28,583
If he did, why would
he have come onboard?

579
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,041
Because he was ordered to.

580
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,417
To die?

581
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,083
It is the expectation
of any officer

582
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,500
to be ordered to
die at any time.

583
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,125
For a Klingon,
perhaps,

584
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:43,625
but Riker's people do not
volunteer for death so easily.

585
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:47,291
He may be a spy,

586
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:50,417
but he's no coward.

587
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:53,583
That only proves
that he's intelligent

588
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:58,709
and you might not be as strong
as you used to be.

589
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:00,625
(<i> indignant snort</i> )

590
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,542
Captain, I've picked up
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

591
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:04,375
So soon?

592
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:08,291
The<i> Enterprise</i> is
on an intercept course with us.

593
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:16,750
You almost had me believing
this was a misunderstanding.

594
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,959
But?

595
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:21,208
The<i> Enterprise</i>
has changed course

596
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,500
and it's following us.

597
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,000
Why?!

598
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,291
Ask them.

599
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:27,458
The reason is obvious.

600
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:29,333
Their intent is clear.

601
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,291
How long before we make contact?

602
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:33,041
Less than
15 minutes, sir.

603
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:35,291
Put the ship on
full battle alert.

604
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:37,375
Arm all photon
torpedoes.

605
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:41,542
Let them charge
into their destruction!

606
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,625
Captain, our
bearings show

607
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,959
that we should be
in contact with the
Klingon vessel now.

608
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,959
Slow to impulse.

609
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,750
Aye, sir, impulse speed.

610
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,583
Hailing frequencies are open.

611
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,083
There's no response.

612
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,542
Continue transmission.

613
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:59,125
The<i> Pagh</i> is either
cloaked or destroyed, sir.

614
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:04,125
Conduct an intensive scan
of the area.

615
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:09,125
The<i> Enterprise</i> has slowed
to impulse speed

616
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:11,792
and is making
an intensive sweep.

617
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:13,709
Hold your position.

618
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:15,291
Let them come to us.

619
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:16,583
They may be here
to help you.

620
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:19,250
Don't be a fool.

621
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,709
Do not forget my rank!

622
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:24,458
I haven't.

623
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,959
I am simply trying
to help you understand.

624
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,583
I understand fully.

625
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:31,250
Now, you understand.

626
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,375
I am still Captain
of this vessel

627
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:37,083
and you are still crew
and sworn to obey me.

628
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,750
You gave me your oath.

629
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,375
Yes, sir, I did.

630
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:45,291
Then fulfill that oath and serve
this ship as you swore to.

631
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,375
Tell me the surest
method of attack

632
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:50,500
against the<i> Enterprise.</i>

633
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
I won't.

634
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,041
You must.

635
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:56,500
It is a matter of honor
and loyalty to your oath.

636
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,375
I will not surrender
the secrets of the
<i>Enterprise</i> to you.

637
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,625
If your word is no good,

638
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,917
then how can we ever
trust Starfleet?

639
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:07,458
I will not break
any vow that I have
taken in the past.

640
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,583
I have also taken an oath
of loyalty to your ship.

641
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:10,625
I will not break that.

642
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,417
They are in conflict!

643
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:14,542
No, sir, they are not.

644
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:16,041
I will obey
your orders.

645
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:17,917
I will serve this ship
as First Officer.

646
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:20,667
And in an attack
against the<i> Enterprise,</i>

647
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,959
I will die with this crew.

648
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:27,625
But I will not
break my oath of
loyalty to Starfleet.

649
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,917
If you had told those secrets
about the<i> Enterprise,</i>

650
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:34,959
I would have
labeled you a traitor

651
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:37,417
and killed you where you stood.

652
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:43,333
But, instead,
you will die with us.

653
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:46,333
You will die like a Klingon.

654
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,125
Sir, I have something
to report to you immediately.

655
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:17,625
Yes, go ahead, Ensign.

656
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:20,166
I have managed to isolate
the organisms on our hull.

657
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:21,542
They are a sub-micron form

658
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:23,417
capable of breaking
nuclear bonds

659
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,375
in the tritanium plating.

660
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,542
But can they be removed
from the hull?

661
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:28,583
Yes.

662
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,166
They are controllable

663
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,375
and can be removed from
the hulls of both ships

664
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:34,625
by using a tunneling
neutrino beam.

665
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,375
Thank you, Ensign.
Well done.

666
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:38,333
Initiate
that procedure.

667
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:39,667
Lieutenant--

668
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,834
add that information
to the hailing messages.

669
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:43,333
Aye, sir.

670
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,500
Lieutenant.

671
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:55,709
The<i> Enterprise</i> has
changed hailing messages.

672
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:58,750
They now include a promise
of cleaning the organisms

673
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,083
and helping in repairs.

674
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:03,375
I told you, they're
here to help.

675
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,709
I do not believe them.

676
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:07,417
Arm all weapons.

677
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:09,291
Prepare to attack.

678
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:15,709
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 42507.8.</i>

679
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:18,208
<i>Although our search</i>
<i>has been extensive,</i>

680
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,375
<i>we are still unable to locate</i>
<i>the Klingon ship</i>

681
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:23,792
<i>or any evidence</i>
<i>of its destruction.</i>

682
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:26,333
Considering the absence
of debris, Captain,

683
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,000
it is reasonable to assume

684
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,917
that the Klingon vessel
is in the area and cloaked.

685
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,333
Agreed.

686
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,125
And since we do not
know its intent,

687
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,166
I recommend we go
to red alert.

688
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,583
Make it so,
Lieutenant.

689
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:40,875
WORF:
Aye, sir.

690
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:44,959
The<i> Enterprise</i> has
raised it's shields.

691
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:46,417
That's a normal
procedure

692
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:48,250
when entering
into a suspicious
situation.

693
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,500
It's not an act
of aggression.

694
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
The<i> Enterprise</i>
will not fire first.

695
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,041
Then they are fools...

696
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,500
for we will.

697
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,750
You'll get
only one shot.

698
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,208
We'll only need one.

699
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:04,125
Stand by on phasers
and torpedoes.

700
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:07,542
Prepare to fire them
simultaneously.

701
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:09,583
I recommend you don't fire

702
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:12,000
until you're
within 40,000 kilometers.

703
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,542
Why?

704
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,750
It will cut down
their response time.

705
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,500
You are honoring
your promise to serve us?

706
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,959
Would you do less?

707
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,875
You will give the order

708
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,542
to fire,
Commander Riker.

709
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:29,500
Call out distances.

710
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,625
Any questions, Mr. Riker?

711
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,291
There's one thing
I'd like to say.

712
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:34,667
I question your judgment.

713
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:36,333
In my opinion,

714
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:40,041
your reason for forcing
this confrontation is not valid.

715
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:42,583
Are you finished?

716
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:45,166
Yes, sir.

717
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:47,417
Commence with attack as ordered.

718
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:49,959
55,000 kilometers
and closing.

719
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,959
Is that a weapon,
Commander?

720
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,625
No, sir.

721
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,208
Give it to me.

722
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,959
We are receiving
an emergency signal

723
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,458
from a command
transponder.

724
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:12,208
Location
035-mark-313.

725
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:14,959
Frequency and code designate it
as Commander Riker.

726
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:17,750
Chief O'Brien, lock
onto that transponder signal.

727
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,542
Yes, Captain.

728
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:22,041
We're not yet in safe range
for a transfer.

729
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,583
And defensive shields
are still in place.

730
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,917
We may have
to stretch it.

731
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:27,542
We have to know what's going on

732
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,959
and Command Riker
is the only one
who can tell us.

733
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:32,125
We'll beam him directly
here, onto the Bridge.

734
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,417
On my command.

735
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:35,750
Yes, sir.
I'll wait till 40,000.

736
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,208
Forty-eight thousand.

737
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,375
Forty-four
thousand.

738
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:42,792
Transporter Room,
stand by.

739
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:44,208
You control the shields.

740
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,291
Ready, sir.

741
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:46,667
Forty thousand.

742
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,000
Forty thousand
kilometers.

743
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,542
Prepare to drop cloaking shields
and fire when ready.

744
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:55,875
Steady.

745
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,041
Transporter Room,
energize.

746
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:07,041
Hold where
you are, Klag.

747
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:09,000
I've relieved Captain Kargan.

748
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,834
He was acting in
an irrational manner.

749
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,375
I'm your Captain now.

750
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:25,166
Where am I?!

751
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:28,250
You're onboard
the Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

752
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,959
Riker has no honor.

753
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:34,667
He tricked me!

754
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:42,500
He is only dazed, sir.

755
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:48,250
Well, that's fine,
but where's Commander Riker?

756
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,959
Cloaking shields off.

757
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:57,875
Obey my orders.

758
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,083
We will be destroyed.

759
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,542
If we are, it will be in battle

760
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:03,959
and I will die with you.

761
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:05,875
So, I repeat,

762
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:08,917
cloaking shields off.

763
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:20,583
WORF:
It is the<i> Pagh,</i> sir.

764
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:23,125
It has all armament
locked on us and ready to fire.

765
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,333
Hold this position.

766
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:26,125
Hailing frequencies.

767
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:28,041
Calling the<i> Pagh,</i>
this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

768
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:30,667
We are here to assist.
Do not fire.

769
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:32,917
They will not believe you.

770
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:34,792
<i>Pagh,</i> we are here to assist.

771
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,041
Do you read me?

772
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,583
<i>Enterprise,</i>
this is Captain William Riker

773
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,375
of the Klingon vessel<i> Pagh.</i>

774
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:46,625
I order you to lower
your shields and surrender.

775
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:53,417
Lower shields.

776
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:56,208
Surrender, as ordered.

777
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:58,834
KARGAN:
I demand
to be beamed

778
00:41:58,834 --> 00:42:01,083
back aboard my vessel!

779
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:02,750
Transporter Chief,

780
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,917
prepare to beam Captain Kargan
back aboard the<i> Pagh.</i>

781
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:06,625
O'BRIEN:
Aye, sir.

782
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:12,041
Captain Riker, we can carry out
your repairs immediately.

783
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:15,208
Thank you, Captain Picard.

784
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,458
You should
have killed me.

785
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,709
I don't want
your command.

786
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:33,709
But you tricked me to get it.

787
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:35,667
Either way,
you can have it back.

788
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:40,250
Then return to your station.

789
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:45,583
(<i> low growl</i> )

790
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:57,834
Get him off my ship.

791
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:00,250
Yes, Captain.

792
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,417
(<i> quietly:</i> )
You understand
the Klingons better

793
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:05,750
than I thought,
Commander.

794
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,500
Thank you,
my friend.

795
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:43,875
That might have been
one of the shortest assignments

796
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,583
in the history of Starfleet.

797
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,250
Wrong, Number One.

798
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,500
It was almost
the longest.

799
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,750
Well done.

800
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,959
Thank you.

801
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:53,458
Actually, I learned quite a bit.

802
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:56,291
Apparently, not
when to duck.

803
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:59,166
When not to duck
would be more accurate.

804
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:02,625
Welcome aboard,
Number One.

805
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:05,917
Now, Lieutenant, conduct
the Commander to Sick Bay.

806
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:07,750
Aye, sir.

807
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,917
Commander?

808
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,166
Your little toy worked.

809
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:16,333
Thanks.

810
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:19,125
I'm glad it did.

811
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:22,291
You come from a very brave
and unique people.

812
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,625
I'm glad you're with us
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

813
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:25,834
Thank you, Commander.

814
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:28,458
And welcome home.
