1
00:00:03,458 --> 00:00:07,792
So, why were you
rolling around
in Cyprion cactus?

2
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:08,917
You know Rebecca Smith?

3
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:11,792
The new
tactical officer?

4
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:13,417
We took a walk
in the arboretum.

5
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,041
We sat down,
we got comfortable.

6
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,750
Things got a little
romantic, and then
I rolled over. Ah!

7
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:23,834
Blurred vision
and dizziness,
uh, palpitations...

8
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:27,917
a stinging sensation
in the lower spine.

9
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,333
It's Terellian Death
Syndrome, isn't it?

10
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,166
I thought we agreed
you'd come to me

11
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,125
before checking
Starfleet medical database.

12
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,500
Yes, well, this time,
I'm glad I did.

13
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:40,959
Because maybe we can
stop the cellular decay
before it's too late.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,333
Reg, you don't have
Terellian Death Syndrome.

15
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,458
Are you... you're sure?

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,875
I'm sure.

17
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:55,083
Then maybe it<i> is</i>
Symbalene blood burn.

18
00:00:55,125 --> 00:01:00,750
No. No. I don't see
anything wrong with
you at all.

19
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:02,458
Wait a minute.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,625
There is a slight imbalance
in your K-3 cell count.

21
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:06,917
My K-3s? Oh, no.

22
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,542
Barclay, I'm sure
it's nothing.

23
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:14,750
Look, I'll run
a microcellular scan.
We'll see.

24
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,917
This will take
a couple of minutes.

25
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,917
Nurse Baldwin, I need
that hemotoxin series

26
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,083
on Ensign Brooks
right away.

27
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,417
How's my
smallest patient doing?

28
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,208
I believe she
is doing well.

29
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,750
Her appetite has increased
by seven percent

30
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:34,750
and she is
beginning to engage
in prenatal behavior.

31
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:36,625
Oh, she is getting close.

32
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:39,500
You'll have a fresh
litter of hungry kittens
before the week is over.

33
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,500
Let me just run
an amniotic scan

34
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:42,500
to make sure
everything's fine...

35
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:43,750
Doctor?
And then I'll...

36
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:47,208
Doctor, my capillaries
are shrinking.

37
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,667
Excuse me.

38
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,250
Alyssa, can you take care
of Spot for a minute?

39
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,208
Start a preliminary
amniotic scan.

40
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,166
Yes, Doctor.

41
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,291
My intravascular
pressure...

42
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,917
it's going
through the roof.

43
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,333
You're right.
It is elevated.

44
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,959
You've also got heightened
electrophoretic activity.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,083
Electrophoretic activity?
Is it serious?

46
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:11,792
Well, based on this,
I'd say you've got...

47
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:12,875
70, maybe 80 years.

48
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:16,083
80... 80 years?

49
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,333
Yes, Reg.

50
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,291
What you've got is a mild
case of Urodelean flu.

51
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,709
Now, it's nothing
serious. Most humans have
a natural immunity to it.

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,500
But the T cell in your DNA
that would normally

53
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,291
fight off the infection
is dormant.

54
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,000
Hmm.

55
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,667
So, you mean,
I have bad genes.

56
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:34,917
You have one dormant gene
out of 100,000,

57
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,000
and I can activate that gene
with a synthetic T cell

58
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:43,667
to let the body
fight the infection
naturally.

59
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,875
You should feel better
in a couple of days.

60
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:49,083
Thank you, Doctor.
I feel much, much better.

61
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:53,667
Good! Now, stay away
from medical database.

62
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,583
And you stay out
of the arboretum.

63
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,041
Everything looks
fine, Data.

64
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,458
You want to know the
sex of the kittens?

65
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,458
I have noticed that many
humans prefer not to know

66
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,458
in order to experience
the surprise during birth.

67
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,041
I believe I will preserve
the mystery until then.

68
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:16,208
I know what you
mean. I don't want
to know either.

69
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,875
Alyssa?

70
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:20,291
Spot's not the only
one who's going
to be a mother.

71
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,875
Oh, Alyssa,
that's wonderful!

72
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:24,709
How did Andrew
take the news?

73
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,959
Well, he was a little
shocked, but he's
getting over it.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,125
I have spent the
past nine weeks as
an expectant parent.

75
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,917
I would be happy to
share my insights
with your husband.

76
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,959
If my experience
is any indication,

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,959
he will need all
the help he can get.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,375
(<i> meowing</i> )

79
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:10,709
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

80
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,000
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

81
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,709
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

82
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,208
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

83
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,625
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

84
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:29,709
<i>to boldly go where</i>
<i>no one has gone before.</i>

85
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:30,166
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47653.2.</i>

86
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,959
<i>We are performing</i>
<i>field tests</i>

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,917
<i>of our new tactical systems</i>
<i>and weapon upgrades.</i>

88
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,959
<i>Mr. Worf is supervising</i>
<i>the exercises.</i>

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,834
The next test will involve
the new photon torpedoes.

90
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,917
The explosive yield
has been increased by 11%,

91
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,959
and<i> I</i> have enhanced
the targeting system
for increased accuracy.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,083
Sounds fascinating,
Mr. Worf. Please proceed.

93
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,125
Setting targeting
coordinates--

94
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:59,834
005 mark 317,
spread pattern delta 94.

95
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,458
Torpedoes armed
and loaded, sir.

96
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,792
Fire when ready.

97
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,250
Worf?

98
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,917
One of the torpedoes
has veered off course.

99
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,792
It appears to be
a malfunction in
the guidance system.

100
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:24,792
Abort and destroy.

101
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:26,834
The torpedo is
not responding.

102
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,291
Subspace detonator
will not engage.

103
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,917
Lock on phasers.

104
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,375
The torpedo
is out of range.

105
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:37,709
Even for your newly
improved phasers?

106
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,250
Maintain a sensor lock
on the torpedo, Mr. Worf.

107
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,792
We'll have
to go after it.

108
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,458
That would
be inadvisable, sir.

109
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,625
The asteroid field
is unusually dense.

110
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:49,041
The<i> Enterprise</i> is
too large to safely
navigate through it.

111
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,291
Then I'll take
a shuttlecraft
and retrieve it.

112
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,083
Mr. Data,
you're with me.

113
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,834
Captain, the shuttle
pilot who's on duty
is Lieutenant Hayes.

114
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,375
I happen to be a
reasonably qualified
pilot, Number One.

115
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:03,125
Besides, these tests
hardly require

116
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,041
the captain's
personal attention.

117
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,333
Understood.
Enjoy yourself.

118
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,291
Mr. Worf...

119
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:16,667
I think that you should
consider analyzing your
new guidance system.

120
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:22,041
Captain, I will need
a few minutes to attend
to a personal matter.

121
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,875
Me?
It is possible
that it will take

122
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,875
several days for
Captain Picard and me
to complete our mission.

123
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:34,000
I would prefer to have
a human present to supervise
the birthing process.

124
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,625
Well, I'd be honored.

125
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,875
Yes... ooh.

126
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:38,667
(<i> purring</i> )

127
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,917
I have noticed that you
are the only other member

128
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,959
of the crew whom Spot
seems to like.

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,667
Really?
That's hard to believe.

130
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:49,125
You're such
a sweet little kitty.

131
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:54,333
She is to you.
However,

132
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,834
there have been
several injuries

133
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,000
to other members
of the crew

134
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,667
who have attempted
to care for Spot.

135
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:05,333
So, has she, um...
picked a place?

136
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,041
A place?

137
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:11,375
Cats usually like to
pick a specific location
to give birth

138
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:16,125
and it's usually
dark and secluded.

139
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,625
And I believe...

140
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:23,083
that this is...

141
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,208
it.

142
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:34,208
I'm curious, sir.
Who's the father?

143
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,208
I am not certain.

144
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,208
Spot has escaped
from my quarters
on several occasions

145
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,458
and there<i> are 12</i> male
felines on board.

146
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,041
I intend to run a full
DNA analysis on the
kittens once they...

147
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,125
Picard to Data.
Report to Shuttle Bay Two.

148
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:53,166
On my way, sir.
Good-bye, Spot.

149
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,667
I believe you are
in good hands.

150
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,375
You have nothing
to worry about, sir.

151
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,041
Oh!

152
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,834
(<i> thump</i> )

153
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,583
Problem?

154
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,834
I have performed
13 diagnostics
on the weapons array

155
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,000
and I can find
nothing wrong with
the guidance system.

156
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,083
I'll have Geordi run
a diagnostic on the
torpedo bay itself.

157
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,250
Maybe he can
find something.

158
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,709
Must you stand
so close to me?

159
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,917
Lieutenant,
are you all right?

160
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,250
Yes, yes, I'm fine.
No, you're not.

161
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,583
You've been working
for six hours straight.

162
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,583
You're tired.
Take a break.
But...

163
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,875
That's an order,
Lieutenant.

164
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:49,875
TROI:
Thanks for waiting.

165
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,500
Do not approach me
unannounced, especially
when I'm eating!

166
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:57,083
We were supposed
to be having lunch
together, remember?

167
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,917
I was hungry!

168
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,834
Well, I'm hungry, too.

169
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,375
Excuse me.
Yes?

170
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:07,166
Could I have an order
of Ongilin caviar?

171
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,667
Make that
a double order.

172
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:09,917
Certainly.

173
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,250
Caviar?
For lunch?

174
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,792
I'm in the mood
for something salty.

175
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:18,583
Besides, it's no stranger
than what you're eating.

176
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,875
Have you noticed how dry
the air is on this ship?

177
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,959
I wonder if the
environmental controls
are set properly.

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,583
(<i> belching</i> )

179
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,959
You're excused.

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Here you go.

181
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,709
Mmm.

182
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:57,500
Is something wrong?

183
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,041
It has been
a difficult day.

184
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,667
The torpedo
guidance system failed.

185
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,208
It was my fault.

186
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,291
You always say that.

187
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,333
It was my fault!

188
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,625
I designed that
guidance system!

189
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:21,000
Worf, calm down.

190
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,625
I think you're under
more stress than
you'd like to admit.

191
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:28,250
Maybe you should
get some rest.

192
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,250
Perhaps you are right.

193
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,959
If you will excuse me!

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,750
I didn't mean right now.

195
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,500
(<i> yelling</i> )

196
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,875
We removed the torpedo bay's
primary guidance module

197
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:51,417
and we found a power
fluctuation in the
forward sensor cluster.

198
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,333
Now, we think it may be
a radial imbalance in
the phase discriminator.

199
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,500
Now, what we
want to do next

200
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,792
is run a level-4
diagnostic,

201
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:58,000
but we're going to
have to shut down

202
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,375
auxiliary power
to 19 decks...

203
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:00,959
Wait a minute.
Slow down.

204
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,959
You lost me back there.
Which sensor clusters?

205
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,625
The forward. It's...
it's a power fluctuation
in the converter nodes.

206
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,291
It's a minor adjustment.
It's minor.

207
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,041
It's all right here
on this diagram, Commander.

208
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,375
Hmm... I'll look
this over later.

209
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,792
Go ahead... you run
your diagnostic.

210
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,208
I'll inform the
other departments

211
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,125
about the, uh...
power systems.

212
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,208
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

213
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,959
I'll check that.

214
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,583
He's full of
energy today.

215
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,166
I can't get him
to slow down.

216
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,166
He's been working like
that since last night.

217
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,834
BARCLAY:
It looks like
a plasma conduit

218
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,417
cut out in junction 17.
I'll go look at it.

219
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,875
Wait a minute, Reg,
I'll go with you.

220
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,166
Keep you posted.

221
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:52,500
Computer, increase
ambient temperature
by two degrees centigrade

222
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,458
and increase relative
humidity by ten percent.

223
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,208
Computer, reset
environmental controls
to standard.

224
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,750
Worf,
it's freezing in here.

225
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,041
You have already
raised the temperature
three times.

226
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,041
It is too hot.
Live with it.

227
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,083
Computer, execute
my original command.

228
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,709
I need a bath.
You have the Bridge.

229
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,083
Here we are.

230
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,667
Looks like a
ruptured conduit.

231
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,166
No problem.

232
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:28,250
I'll just bypass it.

233
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:32,041
(<i> panting</i> ):
Reg, wait a second here.

234
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,458
Take a look at these
corroded edges here.

235
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,959
It looks like something
has dissolved the bulkhead

236
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,125
and eaten right through
the conduit.

237
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:44,125
There are high levels
of cholic acid here--
enzymatic agents.

238
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:49,000
You know, I wouldn't
be surprised if that
solvent was organic.

239
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,959
Maybe we should run
a biospectral analysis
on the solvent.

240
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,041
Take a closer look.
That's a very good idea.

241
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,291
But first...
we should take a break.

242
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:01,208
You go ahead, sir.
I'll take care of it.

243
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,458
Commander, we received
a communication
from Starfleet.

244
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,083
They wanted to know
when they could expect

245
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,583
your performance analysis
of the new weapon systems.

246
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,291
The weapon systems?

247
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,458
Yes, sir.

248
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,667
The ones we've been testing
for the past few days?

249
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,792
That's right.

250
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,458
What should I
tell them... sir?

251
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,583
Tell them...

252
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,166
tell them
we haven't finished yet.

253
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,333
What are you doing here?

254
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,709
I had to be near you.

255
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,834
Computer, increase
temperature by
five degrees.

256
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,834
Get out of
that water now!

257
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:56,750
Leave me alone!

258
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,667
(<i> screams</i> )

259
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,750
Could I have
a glass of water?

260
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,417
It's so cold in here.

261
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,875
Your temperature
has dropped almost
eight degrees.

262
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:17,041
I want to run
a hypothalamic series
right away.

263
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,750
Doctor, we've had
three other crew members

264
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:20,333
complaining about
the temperature levels.

265
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,792
Some feel like
they have fevers.

266
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,000
Others-- they're freezing
like Counselor Troi.

267
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,667
Call Dr. Selar
and Dr. Hacopian.

268
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:27,083
It looks like we've
got some sort

269
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,792
of viral infection
going on around here.

270
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:31,375
I want to check
on Lieutenant Worf.

271
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,917
Worf, have you had any
unusual symptoms lately?

272
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,750
Headaches? Nausea?
Dizziness? Worf?

273
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,125
Worf, do you hear me?

274
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:55,792
I'm going to run a
full bioscan. I want
you to lie down.

275
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,959
Okay, we can
do this sitting up.

276
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:06,583
<i>What</i> is this?

277
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,792
Worf, how long have you
had this on your neck?

278
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:21,417
It looks like it's full
of some bioacidic compound--
almost like a venom sac.

279
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:27,709
Worf...
open your mouth.

280
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,000
(<i> hissing</i> )
(<i> screaming</i> )

281
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,417
Oh! Oh!

282
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:37,625
(<i> screaming</i> )

283
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:38,834
Get a hypospray.

284
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,834
Right away.

285
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,458
I managed to
get her into stasis

286
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,000
before the venom
paralyzed her.

287
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,417
She's going to need
reconstructive surgery,

288
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,667
but I think
she'll be all right.

289
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:56,000
Sir, we've analyzed
the venom

290
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,917
and compared it
to the acidic compound

291
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,667
found at junction 17
and on decks ten and 12.

292
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:02,542
They all have the same
enzymatic composition.

293
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,667
You're saying that Worf
is spraying this...?

294
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,375
Venom.
This venom
all over the ship?

295
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,166
I'd say so.

296
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,375
60 crewmen have begun
exhibiting strange
behavioral changes--

297
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:15,917
memory loss, fatigue,
headaches...

298
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,750
I think one thing
is clear.

299
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:20,709
There's some sort
of disease aboard
the<i> Enterprise...</i>

300
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,834
and it's spreading.

301
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,917
I'm having trouble
concentrating myself.

302
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:29,375
It's like
my mind keeps wandering.

303
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,125
I...

304
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,625
can't...

305
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,291
Commander, I've got
seven security teams

306
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,125
out hunting for Worf,
but for some reason,

307
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,333
the sensors are having
a difficult time
locking on to him.

308
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,583
I've called for a
level-2 security alert.

309
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:45,125
Do you think we should
go to a level-1?

310
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,917
I don't know.
What do you think?

311
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,959
I think we should.

312
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,166
Okay, sounds good.

313
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,834
Then you'll take care
of that... security thing?

314
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,208
Yes, sir, I will.

315
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,417
Okay. I'll notify
Starfleet.

316
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,542
I'll let them know
what's happening.

317
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,709
You have your orders.
Dismissed.

318
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:13,667
Computer,
send a subspace message.

319
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:18,750
Starfleet command.
Security channel.

320
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,667
Authorization...

321
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:25,917
Alpha-four-seven
authorization required to
activate security channel.

322
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,291
Computer...

323
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,709
Awaiting authorization.

324
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,542
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

325
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,417
<i>Commander Data and I have</i>
<i>recovered the stray torpedo</i>

326
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,041
<i>after a three-day search.</i>

327
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,166
<i>We are en route back</i>
<i>to the</i> Enterprise.

328
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:51,875
Captain, the ship
is not at the prearranged
coordinates.

329
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,250
Have they been delayed?

330
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,166
I do not know. I am
unable to raise them

331
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,875
on any
communication channel.

332
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,583
Scan the vicinity.
See if you can find them.

333
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,083
I found it, sir--
two light-years away.

334
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,583
Set a course.

335
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:22,083
The<i> Enterprise</i>
appears to be adrift.

336
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,208
I am reading
power fluctuations
on all decks.

337
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,583
Life signs?

338
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,333
There are life signs.

339
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,875
However, sensor readings
are highly distorted.

340
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:34,208
I am unable to identify
specific life-forms.

341
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,333
Adjust
the axial stabilizers

342
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,917
to match the attitude
and rotation rate
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

343
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:43,041
I'm going to dock
the shuttle manually.

344
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:23,041
(<i> liquid dripping</i> )

345
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,625
Main power is off-line.

346
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:43,166
All systems are in standby
or emergency mode.

347
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,041
There is no response
from any manned station.

348
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,792
Any sign of the crew?

349
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,875
I cannot access internal
sensors from here.

350
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,667
We will have to go
to the Bridge.

351
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:54,875
(<i> distant growls and grunts</i> )

352
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,041
That sounds like animals.

353
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,750
Yes, sir.

354
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:10,375
I am able to discern
over 300 different
vocalizations.

355
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,583
(<i> screech echoing</i> )

356
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,291
Look at this.

357
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:34,750
It is composed
of reptilian DNA.

358
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:37,000
I believe it is
an epidermal layer

359
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:40,291
that has been cast off
during molting.

360
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:44,000
But it seems to be...
humanoid.

361
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,875
Yes, sir.
I cannot explain it.

362
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:48,792
There are no species
aboard the<i> Enterprise</i>

363
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,583
that shed their skin
in this fashion.

364
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:53,792
(<i> distant cries and calls</i> )

365
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,500
Sir.

366
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,667
Hmm.

367
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:09,875
These are Counselor
Troi's quarters.

368
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,500
Can you tell
if she's inside?

369
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:16,250
No, sir.

370
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:19,625
Data, I want to have
a look in here.

371
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,709
Stand ready.

372
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,583
(<i> liquid splashing</i> )

373
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,583
Whew...
environmental settings

374
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,166
in these quarters
have been altered.

375
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,917
Data, over here.

376
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:02,959
Deanna...
What's happened to her?

377
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,250
Her DNA is in a state
of ribocyatic flux.

378
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:12,083
Her genetic codes
are being re-sequenced

379
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,166
and her cells are
mutating as a result.

380
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:18,500
At a fundamental
level, sir, she is
no longer human.

381
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,250
What is she?

382
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,333
Her respiratory tissue
has become capable

383
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,625
of metabolizing
both water and air

384
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:28,166
and her eyes
have developed
nictitating membranes.

385
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,500
I believe she is
amphibian, sir.

386
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:33,125
She has been injured.

387
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:36,000
Yes, sir.

388
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,000
There is Klingon DNA
in the wound.

389
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,417
It is saliva.

390
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:43,250
Are you saying
she's been bitten?

391
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,917
It would appear so.

392
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:51,375
I will need to run a full
biospectral analysis.

393
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,792
(<i> sighs</i> )

394
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:58,166
First, we've got to get
the ship under control.

395
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,542
Let's go to the Bridge.

396
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,583
His upper spinal
column has been broken
in three places.

397
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,375
It looks as though
he's been attacked
by an animal.

398
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:30,583
Yes, sir.

399
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:34,083
Has his DNA been
changed, as well?

400
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,875
Yes, sir.

401
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:39,667
However, it was
in its initial stages
when he died.

402
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:49,291
(<i> console beeping</i> )

403
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,166
Captain...

404
00:25:57,208 --> 00:26:01,834
I am picking up 1,011
individual life-forms
within the ship.

405
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,208
All exhibit a
similar genetic flux

406
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,083
to the one we observed
in Counselor Troi.

407
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:08,750
So, the entire ship
has been affected.

408
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:11,834
Most of the life-forms
are scattered
throughout the ship.

409
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,583
However, there are several
large concentrations

410
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:17,125
in the arboretum
and the aquatic lab.

411
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,750
I've regained attitude
control to the ship,

412
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:22,291
but main power
is still off-line.

413
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:26,375
It looks as though the
entire power transfer grid
has been destroyed.

414
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:27,917
(<i> thumping</i> )

415
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:40,458
(<i> growling</i> )

416
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,291
Will?

417
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,291
Captain.

418
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:17,500
(<i> grunting</i> )

419
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:21,333
His cranial plates
have thickened by 20%.

420
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,208
His brain
is much smaller, sir.

421
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,375
I do not believe he can
comprehend our language.

422
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:28,709
Perhaps we can find
a way to communicate.

423
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,875
Will, can you
understand what it
is that I'm...?

424
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,291
(<i> growling</i> )

425
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,583
He looks almost
protohuman.

426
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:55,709
Yes, sir. His DNA
would seem to confirm
that observation.

427
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:00,458
Captain, I believe
the crew is de-evolving.

428
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:13,875
This tranquilizer
should keep him unconscious
for another seven hours.

429
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,166
What have you found out?

430
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:21,875
I have analyzed
Commander Riker's
DNA structure.

431
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:25,750
A synthetic T cell
has invaded his
genetic codes.

432
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:29,959
This T cell has begun
to activate his
latent introns.

433
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,875
Introns?

434
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:35,500
They are genetic
codes which are
normally dormant.

435
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:38,583
They are evolutionary
holdovers--

436
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:41,250
sequences of DNA
which provided

437
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:43,750
key behavioral and
physical characteristics

438
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:47,083
millions of years ago,
but are no longer
necessary.

439
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,792
For instance, Counselor
Troi's gill slits

440
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:54,083
and other amphibious
characteristics were
derived from introns

441
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,583
which still contain
amphibious codes.

442
00:28:56,625 --> 00:29:00,291
So, these introns
are causing her DNA

443
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,875
to recombine in an
earlier configuration.

444
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:04,875
That is correct.
In her case,

445
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,625
the DNA has created
an amphibious life-form

446
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:11,750
which became extinct
over 50 million years ago.

447
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,750
And Commander Riker's
introns are changing<i> him</i>

448
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:17,417
into what appears
to be one of the
earlier hominids.

449
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:20,917
Yes, sir. I would say
Australopithecine.

450
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:26,750
Each of these stages
is another link in
the evolutionary chain

451
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:30,750
which stretches back
to the origins of all
life-forms on Earth.

452
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:35,500
Because introns can
include genetic material
from many different species

453
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:39,000
over millions of
years of evolution,
it is possible

454
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:42,417
that a wide variety of
transformations is
occurring among the crew.

455
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:45,041
What about those
crew members who
are not from Earth?

456
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,500
All humanoid life has
a similar genetic pattern.

457
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:52,875
The virus should work
on nonhuman crew members
in the same way.

458
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:58,458
They are each de-evolving
into earlier forms of life
on their homeworlds.

459
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,083
I feel I must
inform you, sir.

460
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:05,458
You have also been
infected by the
intron virus.

461
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,709
How long before
I begin to change?

462
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,959
According to
my calculations,
within the next 12 hours

463
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,125
you will begin to
exhibit the first signs

464
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:18,667
of your eventual
transformation.

465
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:23,208
And what will that be?

466
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,583
I believe
you will also de-evolve

467
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,667
into an earlier form
of primate,

468
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:32,667
possibly similar to a
lemur or pygmy marmoset.

469
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:43,875
Well...
before I begin swinging
through the ship

470
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:47,041
looking for breakfast,
we'd better find
some answers.

471
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:48,959
How do we reverse
the process?

472
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,583
I am uncertain.
We will need to run

473
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:53,417
several
micro-cellular scans.

474
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:57,083
However, the ship's
main computer has
been damaged.

475
00:30:57,125 --> 00:31:00,000
Captain, the computer
in my quarters

476
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:03,375
has an independent
processing and
memory storage unit.

477
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,166
It should not
have been affected.

478
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:06,834
I suggest we start
from there.

479
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:09,125
Agreed.

480
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:23,083
(<i> meowing</i> )

481
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:29,875
It would appear that Spot
has had her kittens.

482
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:39,083
They sound hungry.

483
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,709
Yes.

484
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,834
I am curious as to
why Spot is not
caring for them.

485
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,875
(<i> ratcheting growl</i> )

486
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,959
It would seem
that the intron virus

487
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,542
is not limited
to humanoid life-forms.

488
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,625
No, sir.

489
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:03,000
(<i> steady beeping</i> )

490
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:09,333
PICARD:
What is it?

491
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:12,458
These kittens were born
less than 24 hours ago.

492
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,000
It would appear that
Spot's transformation

493
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:18,041
took place
at approximately
the same time.

494
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:22,291
So, spot was giving
birth to the kittens

495
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:25,458
at the same time that
she was changing into
a reptilian life-form.

496
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,750
I believe so.

497
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:30,000
For some reason,
the intron virus

498
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:32,375
was not passed on
to the kittens.

499
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,458
I do not know why.

500
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:39,917
If I remember my biology,
there are several
natural immune systems

501
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,417
that come into play
in the mother's womb

502
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,834
to protect the fetus
from viral infections.

503
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,542
That is true.

504
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:49,041
Placental barriers,
maternal antibodies
and amniotic fluids

505
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,291
all serve
as a filtration system.

506
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:54,417
Maybe we could
have inhibited
the intron virus

507
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:58,125
by using the
natural antibodies
in Spot's amniotic fluid.

508
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,166
It would take
further research,
but I believe,

509
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:04,166
to be effective on
humanoid crew members,

510
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:06,458
humanoid antibodies
would be necessary.

511
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,917
Then we should locate
a pregnant humanoid.

512
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,583
Nurse Ogawa has recently
become pregnant.

513
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,041
Where is she?

514
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,041
I have traced
her combadge signal

515
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,709
to deck 17,
section 21 alpha.

516
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,750

518
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:26,291
One of the warp plasma
vents has failed.

519
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,125
Main engineering
has been abandoned.

520
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,333
There is no one there
to fix the problem.

521
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:41,583
I can repair the damaged
plasma vent from here.

522
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:45,041
I'm going to check the
status of the warp core.

523
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
(<i> yells</i> )

524
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,792
Data!

525
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,834
What was that?

526
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,625
I believe it was
Lieutenant Barclay.

527
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:35,250
He appeared to be
partially transformed
into an arachnid.

528
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,333
A spider?

529
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,417
Yes, sir.

530
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:41,333
Are you all right,
Captain?

531
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:45,834
I have these
intense feelings of...

532
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,333
fear...

533
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:51,500
and panic.

534
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,166
I feel as if I were
being watched.

535
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:55,875
I can't...
I can't explain it.

536
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:59,709
You may be experiencing
the initial stages
of your transformation.

537
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,166
Early primates were often
prey to large carnivores.

538
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,583
As a result, their
instincts probably included

539
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,709
a heightened sense
of awareness.

540
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:12,375
In that case,
my instincts tell me
that we'd better hurry.

541
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:31,166
Captain, I have analyzed
Nurse Ogawa's embryo.

542
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:33,750
It is unaffected
by the virus.

543
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:35,750
I believe I can use
her amniotic fluid

544
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:38,250
as a template
for a retrovirus.

545
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:40,792
It would neutralize
the synthetic T cell

546
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:43,375
and reestablish the genetic
patterns of each host.

547
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:45,208
How soon can
you do that?

548
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,834
It will not take long to
isolate the appropriate
genetic material.

549
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,959
I will need to get
the Sick Bay
computer back on...

550
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,083
(<i> tapping</i> )

551
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:55,250
(<i> thumping</i> )

552
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,375
What was that?

553
00:35:56,417 --> 00:35:59,542
(<i> beeping</i> )

554
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:04,125
It is large.
Approximately
200 kilograms.

555
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:08,041
It is heavily armored
with an exoskeleton.

556
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:12,333
Life signs appear
to be Klingon.

557
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,166
Worf.

558
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:19,375
(<i> thumping continues</i> )

559
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,208
(<i> growling</i> )

560
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,417
(<i> growling</i> )

561
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:29,834
Set your phaser
on heavy stun.

562
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,583
We can't be certain
the stun setting

563
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:32,750
will have
any effect on him.

564
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,375
A higher setting
might kill him.

565
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:36,166
(<i> growling</i> )

566
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:38,041
Listen to that.

567
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,583
He sounds very angry...

568
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:42,667
really...
really aggressive.

569
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:44,709
What do you
think he wants?

570
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,208
Do you think he's
responding to some...

571
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,834
some predatory instinct?

572
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,792
(<i> thumping</i> )

573
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,792
Do you think he
sees us as prey?

574
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:56,583
There are crew members
in the corridors

575
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:58,667
and other sections
of the ship.

576
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:01,166
It would be easier
for him to capture
and consume one of them

577
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,458
than to attempt
to break through a door.

578
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
(<i> growling</i> )

579
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:10,834
Then what<i> does</i> he want?

580
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:15,542
Predators use vocalizations
to frighten other predators

581
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:18,417
and to mark territory...

582
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:24,333
and to commence
mating process.

583
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,875
A mating process...

584
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,750
Counselor Troi
was bitten by a Klingon,

585
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:33,250
but not in a place
that might be
life-threatening.

586
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,458
Nowhere near
a major artery or organ.

587
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,667
Data, look at this.
Look at this injury.

588
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:42,291
This wound was
never intended

589
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,333
to give her any
kind of serious harm.

590
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,542
Captain,
what are you suggesting?

591
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:50,166
Is it possible that
Worf could see Counselor
Troi as his mate?

592
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:54,250
If that is true,
he must be trying
to reach her now.

593
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:55,500
Well, we can't just leave.

594
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:57,208
We have to stay here
and protect her.

595
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,166
And we have to keep on
working on the retrovirus.

596
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:02,625
If we could distract him.

597
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:05,083
If we could lure him
away from her...

598
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:08,542
The mating instinct
is quite strong
in Klingon biology.

599
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:11,041
I am not certain
what would be an
effective lure.

600
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,667
Klingons have got a very
powerful sense of smell.

601
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:16,375
If we could duplicate
Deanna's pheromones

602
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:18,917
and then convince
him that she's no
longer in Sick Bay,

603
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:21,542
that she'd gone into some
other part of the ship...

604
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,125
I am extracting
a blood sample

605
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,875
from one of her
sebaceous glands

606
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:31,792
where the pheromones
are produced.

607
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,834
I believe I can
activate the pheromones

608
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,834
with a bioactivant
solution.

609
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,375
Can you amplify
the pheromones?

610
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:44,875
They need to be
much more powerful

611
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:47,166
than Deanna's
actual scent.

612
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:49,959
I believe this will
produce the desired effect.

613
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,166
I will use it to draw Worf
to another part of the ship.

614
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:53,291
No, no, no. You
must go on working

615
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:55,417
on the retrovirus.
I'll go.

616
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,083
Captain, that is extremely
unwise. Worf may be faster...

617
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:02,041
No time...
No time to argue.

Go ahead, Data.

637
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:08,417
The retrovirus
is working, sir.

638
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:11,583
I can release it into
the ship's atmosphere
in a gaseous state.

639
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,875
However, it will take
some time to take effect.

640
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:15,875
Acknowledged!

641
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:18,375
Are you all right, sir?

642
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:20,458
Yes, I'm fine, Mr. Data.

643
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,250
Proceed.

644
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,375
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

645
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:29,291
Well, Mr. Worf...

646
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:34,542
let's hope that
when you wake up,
you're a new man.

So, this is my fault.

653
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:57,083
No. In a way,
it's mine.

654
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:59,125
I didn't realize
it at the time,

655
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:01,417
but there's an anomaly
in your genetic chemistry

656
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:04,250
that caused the synthetic
T cell to mutate.

657
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:07,000
Instead of activating
one dormant gene,

658
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:10,875
it started activating
all of them, including
your introns.

659
00:43:10,917 --> 00:43:12,792
And that's what...

660
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:16,000
(<i> softer</i> ):
And that's what caused
me to de-evolve?

661
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:18,291
You and every other
member of the crew.

662
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:22,417
The T cell became airborne
and started to spread
like a virus.

663
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:26,291
You know, Reg,
this is a completely
new disease

664
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,750
and it's traditional
to classify a new disease

665
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:31,375
with the name of the
first diagnosed patient.

666
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:36,709
Oh, you mean
you want to name
the disease after me?

667
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,750
That's right.
How about "Barclay's
Protomorphosis Syndrome"?

668
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:41,917
"Barclay's
Protomorphosis..."

669
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:43,667
Um, well...

670
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:47,166
it has a nice
ring to it.

671
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,291
Thank you, Doctor.

672
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:53,750
He transformed
into a spider

673
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:56,875
and now he has a disease
named after him.

674
00:43:56,917 --> 00:44:00,875
I think I better
clear my calendar
for the next few weeks.
