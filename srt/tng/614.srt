00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:19,458
(<i> gasping</i> )

2
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:24,625
(<i> groans</i> )

3
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,959
Computer,
lights.

4
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:36,959
Computer,
turn on the lights.

5
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,959
(<i> groans</i> )

6
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,291
(<i> gasps</i> )

7
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:03,875
<i>Space,</i>
<i>the final frontier.</i>

8
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:08,542
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

9
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:10,041
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

10
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,875
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

11
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:18,417
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

12
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:22,625
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

13
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,417
Good,
you're awake.

14
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,667
Who are you?

15
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,500
Please, Counselor,
there is little time.

16
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,542
The Commander will be
calling for you at any moment.

17
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:37,500
Where am I?
You are aboard

18
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,667
the imperial Romulan
warbird<i> Khazara.</i>

19
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,917
I am Subcommander N'vek.

20
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,875
Warbird?

21
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,375
I-- I was at the, uh...

22
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:54,000
neuropsychology
seminar at Bokara VI.

23
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,792
The last thing
I remember was

24
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:58,166
returning
to my quarters.

25
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,542
I was attacked.

26
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:02,417
I felt a hypospray.

27
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:04,417
It was necessary.
I could not be certain

28
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:05,834
you would come
voluntarily.

29
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:09,125
Oh, God, my head's
still spinning.

30
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,583
There are drugs
in your system,

31
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,917
but they've nearly
dissipated.

32
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,792
The disorientation
will soon pass.

33
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:15,125
Why have you
brought me here?

34
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,458
Listen to me
carefully.

35
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,500
You are no longer
Deanna Troi.

36
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,667
You are Major Rakal
of the Tal Shiar--

37
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,208
the Imperial
intelligence.

38
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,000
Commander Toreth--
Am I a prisoner?

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,750
There is no time
to explain everything.

40
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,542
You must listen.

41
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:30,083
Commander Toreth will
want to know your mission.

42
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,583
Tell her nothing.

43
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,959
Simply instruct her

44
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,625
to proceed
to the Kaleb sector.

45
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,583
Heading 102 mark 4.

46
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,959
The Kaleb sector?

47
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,625
Repeat it.
Heading 102 mark 4.

48
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,750
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Heading 102 mark 4.

49
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,208
And she'll take
orders from me?

50
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,208
You are an officer
of the Tal Shiar.

51
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,709
She will obey you,
but do not push her too far.

52
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,000
FEMALE:
Subcommander N'vek,

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,667
we are approaching
the loading point.

54
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,500
Bring our guest
to the bridge.

55
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,959
Yes, Commander,
immediately.

56
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,291
Please, we must hurry.

57
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,917
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me

58
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,500
what's going on.

59
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,667
You are a Starfleet officer
disguised as a Romulan.

60
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:13,041
Unless you trust me
and do exactly as I have said,

61
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,417
Toreth will discover you,
and you will be killed.

62
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,333
How do I know I won't
be killed anyway?

63
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,458
Your only chance
to get off this ship alive

64
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,208
is to do as I say.

65
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,000
You are an empath.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You would know if
I am lying-- am I?

67
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:32,959
No.

68
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,959
Then let us go see
the commander.

69
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,583
Orbit established,
Commander.

70
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,458
Commence loading
of the cargo.

71
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,041
Notify me when
the transfer is complete.

72
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,458
Yes, sir.

73
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,625
Commander,
may I present

74
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,166
Major Rakal
of the Tal Shiar.

75
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,458
This is
Commander Toreth.

76
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,834
Attend to your station.

77
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,542
Why are you here
without your guards?

78
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,542
Well?

79
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,834
The mission is
one of utmost secrecy.

80
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,041
I could not risk
bringing guards.

81
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,667
And what exactly
is the nature

82
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:46,625
of this clandestine
assignment?

83
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,458
I cannot reveal that.

84
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,917
Oh?

85
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:51,458
Why not?

86
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,166
I'm under orders.

87
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,583
You don't act like
a member of the Tal Shiar.

88
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,208
How long have you been
with intelligence?

89
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,750
Several months.

90
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,834
Ahh.
(<i> console beeping</i> )

91
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:07,667
Commander, cargo is
on board and secure.

92
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,208
Tell me--
is there a reason

93
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:15,750
why the commander of the ship
is kept ignorant of its cargo?

94
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,458
TROI:
I don't know what you mean.

95
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,583
I have been ordered
to take on cargo,

96
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,208
but its contents
are unknown to me.

97
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,458
Does that seem wise?

98
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,542
I am responsible for
the safety of this ship

99
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,250
and its crew.

100
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,125
How do I know this cargo is
safe to transport?

101
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,500
I'm sure it is safe.

102
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,667
Otherwise, it would
not have been loaded.

103
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,667
Ahh.

104
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,041
The Tal Shiar is
deeply concerned

105
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,458
for the safety
and the well-being

106
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,750
of the military.

107
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,500
I'm sure that
every person

108
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,125
on the bridge of this ship
could offer testimony

109
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,625
about personal experiences
with the Tal Shiar,

110
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,750
but I doubt that many could
recall those encounters

111
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,875
as tender and caring.

112
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,250
So I must ask you
to forgive me, Major,

113
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,250
if I hesitate to accept
your assurances

114
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,625
that that cargo presents
no danger to my crew.

115
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,250
I intend to open
those containers.

116
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:14,583
That cargo is the property
of the Tal Shiar.

117
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,583
You will not touch it.

118
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,291
On whose authority?

119
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,875
Mine. And if you
do not wish to undergo

120
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,875
another "personal experience"
with the Tal Shiar,

121
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,667
I suggest
you not question me again.

122
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,709
Now, proceed on course

123
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:36,166
bearing 102 mark 4
to the Kaleb sector.

124
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,959
Why should we go
to the Kaleb sector?

125
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,083
It's virtually deserted.

126
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,458
Because those are
your orders.

127
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,583
Pilot, set course.

128
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,291
102 mark 4.

129
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,166
Warp six.

130
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,792
PILOT:
Yes, Commander.

131
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,166
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46519.1.</i>

132
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,917
<i>We have arrived</i>
<i>at Research Station 75</i>

133
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:10,917
<i>to take on a rather</i>
<i>unique passenger,</i>

134
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,625
<i>one whose homecoming will</i>
<i>undoubtedly be difficult.</i>

135
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,625
The man acted
dishonorably.

136
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,709
He is a traitor.

137
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,125
He risked his life
to get here.

138
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,709
Spent two weeks
alone in a scout ship.

139
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,875
That does not excuse
his original actions.

140
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,291
Well, maybe he finally
realized he made a mistake.

141
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,875
It's 20 years
too late.

142
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,375
Energize.

143
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,750
Ensign Deseve, by order
of Starfleet command,

144
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,834
I am placing you
under arrest for treason.

145
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,792
I understand.

146
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,959
After Dr. Crusher
declares you medically fit,

147
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,375
you will be confined
to your quarters

148
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,917
until a court-martial
can be convened.

149
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,041
Find some
civilian clothes.

150
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,375
I don't want to see you
in that uniform.

151
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,041
Yes, sir.

152
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,500
Commander?

153
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,000
I must speak
with Captain Picard.

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,166
He's a busy man.

155
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,291
Please.

156
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,917
It's important.

157
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,166
Urgent.

158
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,208
I'll tell him.

159
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,208
Commander.

160
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,083
At ease.

161
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,667
It's Captain,
actually.

162
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,250
Of course.
Um... sorry, sir.

163
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,709
You said it was important
that I see you.

164
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes, Captain.

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,125
I have a message
from Ambassador Spock.

166
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,333
He said it involves
further...

167
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,834
"cowboy diplomacy."

168
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,500
He said you would
understand.

169
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,583
There's a Corvallen
freighter arriving

170
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,875
in the Kaleb sector
in the next 12 hours.

171
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,917
Spock wants you to...

172
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:50,041
rendezvous?--
with that ship,

173
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,166
bring its cargo back
to Federation space.

174
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,208
What kind of cargo?

175
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,667
He said it was...

176
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,875
important...
to the future

177
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,709
of the Romulans
and the Federation.

178
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:03,458
And you have returned in order
to give me this message?

179
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,250
Partly.

180
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,125
In order to know whether
Ambassador Spock's message

181
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,583
is being delivered
accurately,

182
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,166
I need to understand
something about the messenger.

183
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:23,166
I was ready
to come back.

184
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,000
Romulus had...
lost its appeal.

185
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,583
Yet, at one time
you found something

186
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,417
very appealing
about it.

187
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:34,333
The Romulans are
very moral, Captain.

188
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,417
They have
an absolute certainty

189
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,458
about what is right
and what is wrong,

190
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,375
who is a friend
and who is an enemy--

191
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,125
a strict moral compass,

192
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,709
which provides them with
a clarity of purpose.

193
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:49,333
At one time, I found
their sense of purpose,

194
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,709
their passion
and commitment,

195
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,000
to be very
compelling.

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,333
But not anymore.

197
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,375
As I've grown older,
I realize that

198
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:02,333
clarity of purpose is
a more ambiguous matter

199
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,333
than I had thought
in my youth.

200
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,750
Commander Riker,

201
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,500
set a course
for the Kaleb sector.

202
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,959
Warp factor eight.

203
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,542
RIKER:
Aye, aye, sir.

204
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,166
You may wait outside.

205
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,000
Make certain
we're not disturbed.

206
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,709
They're terrified of me.

207
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,625
The purpose of the Tal Shiar
is to ensure loyalty.

208
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,250
To defy them is to invite
imprisonment or death.

209
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,792
I think it's time
you told me

210
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,500
what this is
all about.

211
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,834
That is why
I called you here.

212
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,792
These are
the cargo containers

213
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,125
we brought
on board earlier.

214
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,625
What's in it?

215
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,291
He's alive in stasis.

216
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:07,208
Who is it?

217
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,458
Vice-Proconsul M'ret
of the Imperial Senate

218
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,250
and his two top aides.

219
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,542
M'ret?

220
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,125
He's one
of the highest-ranking members

221
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,709
of the Romulan
government.

222
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,834
His defection will be
a profound blow to Romulus.

223
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:25,792
Why is he doing this?

224
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:27,375
M'ret had questioned

225
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,041
the repressive activities
of the government

226
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,709
and was in danger
of being imprisoned.

227
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,542
He is willing
to take this risk

228
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:35,709
in order to protest
Romulan policy

229
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,917
and support
the dissident movement.

230
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,500
You are part
of Ambassador Spock's

231
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,917
underground movement.

232
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:43,542
Yes.

233
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:45,750
If we're able
to deliver M'ret safely,

234
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,166
Spock is hopeful that we can
establish an escape route

235
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,125
for thousands of dissidents
who live in fear of their lives.

236
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,041
Now you realize
why we are willing

237
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,125
to go to such
extraordinary lengths--

238
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:00,125
even kidnapping you--
to make sure we succeed.

239
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,959
You've given me the identity
of a Tal Shiar officer.

240
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,542
Is there a real
Major Rakal?

241
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:14,041
There was.

242
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,375
She was killed so that
you could take her place.

243
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,041
Only a member
of the Tal Shiar

244
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,959
would have the authority
to alter a ship's mission.

245
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,750
Why me? You could
have found a Romulan

246
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,959
to play this role.

247
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,333
Yes, for the first
part of the plan,

248
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,041
but if anything
goes wrong,

249
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,417
we will need
a Starfleet officer.

250
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,458
Why?

251
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,834
There's no need
to go into that

252
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:37,083
unless it becomes
necessary.

253
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,458
For your own sake,
Counselor,

254
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,834
the less you know
about the specifics

255
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:42,458
of this plan,
the better.

256
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,875
What is your plan?

257
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,917
When we reach
the Kaleb sector,

258
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:51,458
we will rendezvous with
a Corvallen freighter.

259
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,792
You will take
these containers

260
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,917
into their ship
and accompany them

261
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,583
back to Starfleet
headquarters.

262
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,917
The Corvallens are
mercenaries.

263
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:00,917
Do they know what's
in these containers?

264
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:03,208
No, they were hired
simply to take you

265
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,041
to Federation space.

266
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,750
Very well.

267
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:14,500
We are due in
the wardroom shortly.

268
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,125
The senior officers
always dine together.

269
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,291
I'll go to my quarters--
I think it would be best

270
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,041
if I stayed out of the way
of the commander.

271
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,750
No, you will be
expected to attend.

272
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,917
I'll go ahead.

273
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,166
Follow me after
a few moments.

274
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,583
Commander Toreth
must not feel

275
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,542
that anything is unusual.

276
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:37,291
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

277
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,458
We had been told that
the Klingon outpost

278
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,166
was undefended.

279
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,041
So when their
warships decloaked...

280
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:48,291
they took us completely
by surprise.

281
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,834
The Klingons managed
to destroy half my squadron

282
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:54,500
before we even opened fire,
but when we did... ha!

283
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,041
They were
no match for us.

284
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:59,291
I destroyed
their flagship myself.

285
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,083
I received
the Sotarek citation

286
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,583
for my actions
that day.

287
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,000
The intelligence officer

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,625
in charge of that
mission was executed.

289
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,917
Major.

290
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,792
Welcome to our table.

291
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:16,125
Commander.

292
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,792
I suggest you try
the<i> viinerine.</i>

293
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:20,667
It's quite good.

294
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,625
I realize that
it's nothing

295
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,583
compared to what you're
accustomed to on Romulus,

296
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,166
but you could at least
try the<i> viinerine.</i>

297
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,250
I've smelled better<i> viinerine</i>
on prison ships.

298
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,166
No doubt.

299
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,250
Tell me, Major.

300
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,291
Where did you train?

301
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,542
The Intelligence Academy

302
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:53,083
or the Imperial War
College?

303
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,250
The Academy.
Oh.

304
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,375
So you must know
Commander Konsab.

305
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:00,834
I know of him.

306
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:01,959
I assume you sat in

307
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,333
military history
with him.

308
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,667
Yes.

309
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:07,417
Tell me, Major...

310
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,291
what do you think
about his theories

311
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,792
on the differences
between the military

312
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,917
and the Tal Shiar?

313
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,208
Which aspects are you
referring to?

314
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,417
Oh, come now, Major.

315
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,458
Surely you attended
his classes regularly.

316
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,625
It was Konsab's
main theme.

317
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,917
Do you have a point
to make, Commander?

318
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,208
If so,
it has escaped me.

319
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,750
Commander Konsab...

320
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,667
believes that,
in order to function,

321
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:37,709
military officers have
to trust each other.

322
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:39,041
The Tal Shiar,

323
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,542
on the other hand,
trust no one.

324
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:45,083
They expect deception,
so they always find it.

325
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:47,959
Your opinion
of the Tal Shiar

326
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,750
is quite clear,
Commander.

327
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,500
I hope so.

328
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,333
We ensure the loyalty
of the people.

329
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,792
Do you believe the Empire
would be better off

330
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,417
without our protection?

331
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:09,333
Protection? From what?

332
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,500
How was the Empire
threatened

333
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,166
by the words
of an old man,

334
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:18,709
a devoted citizen who merely
tried to speak his mind?

335
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,625
How did the Tal Shiar
protect the Empire

336
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,542
by dragging him,
my father, out of his home

337
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,333
in the middle
of the night?

338
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,792
Clearly, your father
was a traitor.

339
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,709
No.

340
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:34,375
He was just
an idealistic old man.

341
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,458
I never saw him again.

342
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:42,917
I don't need
your devotion, Commander,

343
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:45,959
just your obedience.

344
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,542
And that's all you have.

345
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,625
MALE VOICE:
Commander, sensors
are picking up

346
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,500
an unidentified ship
on an intercept course.

347
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,458
What is the configuration?

348
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,000
It appears to be
a freighter, Commander.

349
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,166
Hail them.

350
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:15,166
Visual.

351
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,917
Commander,
we are glad to see you.

352
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:24,166
We are prepared to transfer
your cargo, as agreed.

353
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,125
And with whom
do you have this agreement?

354
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,583
Our arrangements were made
with Major Rakal.

355
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,542
You may rest assured,
your cargo will be

356
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:35,166
taken safely
to its destination.

357
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,834
We will transmit coordinates
for you to beam it aboard.

358
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,750
He's lying.
Very well.

359
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,291
They have no intention
of keeping their word.

360
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,166
Are you certain?
Yes.

361
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,917
Why did you destroy
that vessel?!

362
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,583
I beg forgiveness,
Commander,

363
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,208
but Major Rakal

364
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,208
ordered me to fire.

365
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,208
The Corvallen freighter
has been completely

366
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,500
destroyed, Commander.

367
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,750
There are
no survivors.

368
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,917
I demand
an explanation.

369
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,834
How many people were
on that ship?

370
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:21,041
Approximately
18 people, sir.

371
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,250
I don't care
if there were 18 or 800.

372
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,792
On this ship, I give
the command to fire, Major.

373
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:29,000
You have no right.

374
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,750
This gives me
the right!

375
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,041
Even you eventually will
have to answer to someone.

376
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,125
You will be held
accountable.

377
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,583
I have been given broad
discretionary powers.

378
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,875
Subcommander N'vek acted
under my authority--

379
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,875
the authority
of the Tal Shiar.

380
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,625
I assure you, this action
will not be questioned.

381
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,208
I will, nonetheless,
make an entry in my log

382
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,375
that I am not responsible
for those 18 lives

383
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,792
and that I deplore
their loss.

384
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:59,542
Do whatever you feel
is necessary.

385
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:02,792
In the meantime,
we must protect ourselves.

386
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,959
Engage
the cloaking device.

387
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:18,083
And what are
my orders now, Major?

388
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,667
Hold position
and wait.

389
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:33,375
There is no sign
of the freighter, sir.

390
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,750
We are the only ship
in the area.

391
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,542
Ensign, verify
our position.

392
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,208
We are holding at
the coordinates

393
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,125
specified by
Ensign Deseve, sir.

394
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,875
Anything on
long-range sensors?

395
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:46,333
Sensors indicate
no other ships

396
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,792
within three
light-years.

397
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,458
Could this have
been a hoax?

398
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,083
That's one possibility.

399
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,375
Mr. Worf, bring Ensign Deseve
to my ready room.

400
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,208
Aye, sir.

401
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,709
Ensign Deseve,
you promised me

402
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,709
a freighter with
an important cargo.

403
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:19,667
The only thing here
is empty space.

404
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,250
Do you have
an explanation?

405
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,000
I don't understand.

406
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,750
Captain,
he has deceived us.

407
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,500
No, I was told
that the ship

408
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,917
would be at
these coordinates.

409
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,625
You said...

410
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,041
that the message
came directly

411
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,750
from Ambassador Spock.

412
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,250
Yes.

413
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,667
Well...

414
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,250
not exactly.

415
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,250
And what does that mean?

416
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,875
Someone else relayed
the message to me,

417
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,458
but he said Spock
spoke directly to him.

418
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,667
I trust the man
who spoke to me.

419
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,083
He would not have lied.

420
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,375
Was he a Romulan?

421
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,834
Yes, he's a member
of the underground--

422
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:56,125
a dissident.

423
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,041
He risks his life
to work with those

424
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,000
who want a different
future for Romulus.

425
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,291
Captain, he could be
leading us into a trap.

426
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,208
No, that is not so.

427
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:07,166
It would be risky
to set a trap here

428
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,834
so close
to Federation space,

429
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:10,166
but the fact remains,

430
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:13,458
here we are...
there is no freighter.

431
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,834
Did your contact tell you

432
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,250
anything else
that might be helpful?

433
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:23,166
The freighter is
an old Antares-class vessel

434
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,166
with limited speed
and range.

435
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,291
It couldn't have taken on
its cargo more than a day ago

436
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,250
which means
it must be within

437
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,500
15 light-years
of here.

438
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:34,709
Why didn't you mention
this earlier?

439
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:38,041
It didn't seem necessary.

440
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:42,000
And, on Romulus, you learn
not to volunteer information.

441
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,166
It's a hard habit
to break.

442
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:47,041
Well, maybe now would be
a good time to start.

443
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,959
Follow me,
gentlemen.

444
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,000
Our plan has collapsed.

445
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,250
Our plan?

446
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,750
What about the people
on that freighter?

447
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,417
Why did you fire?

448
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:11,875
There was no alternative.

449
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,542
You told me
they couldn't be trusted.

450
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:14,875
If I let them live,

451
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,417
the whole mission
would be in jeopardy.

452
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:18,333
18 people lost
their lives.

453
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,458
Don't lecture me,
Counselor.

454
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,125
A number of people
have died in order

455
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,709
to carry out
this mission.

456
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:26,375
Believe me, those 18
won't be the last.

457
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,667
I'm sorry,
but I can't

458
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,667
dismiss those lives
so easily.

459
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:32,291
Fine, agonize
all you want,

460
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,542
but don't let it get
in the way of our plan.

461
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,750
You don't have
a plan anymore.

462
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:44,583
You remember I told you
if anything went wrong,

463
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,166
we would need
a Starfleet officer.

464
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:49,542
There is a Starfleet base
on Draken IV.

465
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,834
It is two days away
at maximum warp.

466
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:53,583
That's where
we're going.

467
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,458
In a Romulan ship?

468
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,000
Yes.

469
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,625
It's your job
to order Toreth

470
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,709
to proceed into
Federation territory.

471
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:04,083
We'll never get through
the gravitic sensor nets.

472
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:08,417
We will, if you provide
the correct access codes.

473
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:14,417
Do you really think this has
a chance of succeeding?

474
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:16,166
If you have
another idea,

475
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,542
I'll be happy
to consider it.

476
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:32,667
TROI:
You will plot a course
for the Draken system.

477
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,500
Oh, you can't be serious.

478
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,959
Draken IV was
the freighter's destination.

479
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,583
I ordered
the freighter destroyed

480
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,375
because I recognized
the captain--

481
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,750
a known Federation spy.

482
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,500
Now we must deliver
the cargo ourselves.

483
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,083
We...?
I do not intend

484
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,959
to explain myself
to you.

485
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,792
You will set
a course...

486
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:53,750
In order to reach Draken,

487
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,834
we will have to travel
through Federation space

488
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,625
for nearly 20 hours.

489
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,625
That is not a problem.

490
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,166
Contrary
to the propaganda

491
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,250
that your superiors
would have us believe,

492
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,166
Starfleet is neither
weak nor foolish.

493
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,750
The chances of us
reaching Draken undetected

494
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,834
are not good.

495
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,250
We will be cloaked.

496
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,083
Oh, the cloaking device

497
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,417
does not always
make us invulnerable.

498
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:17,959
And you would know that
if you had spent any time at all

499
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,208
in the field.

500
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,375
The Federation has
littered its borders

501
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,166
with subspace
listening posts

502
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,000
with gravitic sensors.

503
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,166
They may even have
a tachyon detection grid

504
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:30,667
in operation, in which case,
they will know that we're there.

505
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:34,417
If we are discovered
in Federation territory,

506
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:38,041
it will be interpreted
as an act of war.

507
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:40,709
The Tal Shiar has
obtained access codes

508
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:42,750
to the sensor nets.

509
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,375
I will provide them
if necessary.

510
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,417
That will be
no guarantee

511
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:49,709
that we will escape
undetected.

512
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,208
Your cowardice does not befit
a Romulan soldier.

513
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,375
People blame the military

514
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:05,750
for the wars that
we are asked to fight,

515
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,750
but I think it is
your kind, Major,

516
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,125
that will be
the death of us all.

517
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:29,625
TORETH:
Plot a course for
the Draken system.

518
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,208
Course plotted, sir.

519
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,667
Prepare for warp.

520
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,667
Commander, sensors are
picking up a vessel.

521
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,166
Our cloaking device
is still engaged.

522
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,625
They have not
detected us.

523
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:40,291
Activate viewscreen.

524
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,125
Enlarge.

525
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,375
It is the<i> Enterprise,</i>
Commander.

526
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:53,542
Well, Major,
it appears your suspicions

527
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:56,750
about the freighter
were correct after all.

528
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,625
The Federation has come
in search of its spies.

529
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,500
Status.

530
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,375
They are scanning the debris
of the freighter.

531
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:06,041
Shield levels normal.

532
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:08,208
Weapons systems
not active.

533
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,375
They are not prepared
for battle, sir.

534
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:12,500
Well, they weren't
expecting to find us here,

535
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,667
and I see no reason to alter
that perception.

536
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:17,959
The radiation from
the debris field

537
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,959
could make our cloak detectable
if we engage warp engines.

538
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,208
Proceed at
maneuvering speed.

539
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,458
One moment,
Commander.

540
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,834
We should hold
our position

541
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:28,083
until the<i> Enterprise</i>
has left the area.

542
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,875
We cannot risk detection.

543
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,500
Even if we are detected,

544
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,667
they cannot track us
once we go to warp.

545
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:36,458
We have not established
their intentions.

546
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,500
Their intentions are
obvious, Major,

547
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,583
and are of
no concern to us.

548
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:43,667
Proceed on course,
maneuvering engines only.

549
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,667
Go to warp when we're clear
of the debris field.

550
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:46,959
Yes, Commander.

551
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,083
We should clear
the field in 27 minutes.

552
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:52,959
You will keep me informed
of our progress.

553
00:28:56,542 --> 00:29:00,166
It is not wise to challenge
the Tal Shiar, Commander.

554
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:03,917
I will not let her
tell me how to run my ship.

555
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:18,083
DATA:
It appears to be
the remains of a ship.

556
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,917
My analysis
indicates that it was

557
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:21,375
an Antares-class
freighter.

558
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:23,417
That's the ship
we were supposed to meet.

559
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:25,458
Could there have been
some kind of malfunction--

560
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:27,166
a reactor core breach?

561
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,917
I do not
believe so, sir.

562
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:31,583
That would not be consistent
with the debris pattern.

563
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,917
However, sensors indicate
extremely high levels

564
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,000
of residual antiprotons.

565
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,458
Romulan
disruptor fire.

566
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,709
Correct.

567
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:40,709
And based on
the antiproton decay,

568
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,333
I would estimate
the incident occurred

569
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:44,875
within the last
4.3 hours.

570
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:47,000
Then the Romulans could
still be in the vicinity.

571
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,333
Red alert.
Shields at maximum.

572
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,750
Whatever that
freighter was carrying,

573
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,500
they certainly didn't
want it to reach us.

574
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,000
Are you sure you don't
know what it was?

575
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,333
No, sir, I swear it.

576
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,500
All we have here
are questions.

577
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,875
Mr. Data, continue
with your scan.

578
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,875
We have to get a message
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

579
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:10,041
That's impossible.

580
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,792
It's the perfect
opportunity.

581
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:13,959
The<i> Enterprise</i> is nearby.

582
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:16,875
If we can communicate with them,
they might be able to help us.

583
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:20,542
Counselor, this ship is
traveling under cloak.

584
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:22,083
All of our
electromagnetic

585
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,583
emissions are
being monitored.

586
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:26,542
Any attempt at
communication whatsoever,

587
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,667
and we would be
discovered instantly.

588
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,500
It could not succeed.

589
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,375
We must continue
to Draken IV.

590
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,125
That is
the safest course.

591
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,208
Is there anything
you can do to the ship

592
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:39,583
or to the cloaking device

593
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,792
that would let
the<i> Enterprise</i> track us?

594
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:44,000
Track us?

595
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,583
No.

596
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:48,834
We want to get into Federation
territory undetected.

597
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:52,333
What we want is to get
the dissidents to safety.

598
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,125
Now, answer the question--
is there a way?

599
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:58,166
If there were,
I wouldn't do it.

600
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:03,250
Yes, you will.
Counselor.

601
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,417
We're not playing it
your way anymore, N'vek!

602
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:08,125
I've been kidnapped,
surgically altered,

603
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,458
put in danger--

604
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,375
I've gone along
with all your plans.

605
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:14,375
Now you are going
to listen to me!

606
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:17,333
You find a way to let
the<i> Enterprise</i> track us,

607
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,667
or I will go to Toreth

608
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,083
and tell her
I've discovered

609
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,458
you're a traitor!

610
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,667
I'll have you
ejected into space!

611
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:26,166
Is that clear,
Subcommander?!

612
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:36,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

613
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:42,000
There is
one possibility.

614
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,625
In order for a ship

615
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:46,291
to remain undetectable
while cloaked,

616
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:48,500
the radiative emissions
from the warp engines

617
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
must be precisely
balanced.

618
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,291
The ship's engineer is
a sympathizer.

619
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,542
He may be able
to slightly misalign

620
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,625
one of the nullifier cores.

621
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,041
It would create...

622
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,000
a small magnetic
disruption in space

623
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,417
whenever we were
in motion.

624
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:07,625
Good. Do it.

625
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,583
The effect would only
be intermittent.

626
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,959
They might not
even detect it.

627
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:14,750
If it's the best
we can do,

628
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,875
we have to try it.

629
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,542
Anything more would be

630
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,792
immediately registered
on the bridge.

631
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:21,625
Even this slight
misalignment

632
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:23,333
may be detected.

633
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,375
It's a risk
we have to take.

634
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,709
You're the one that outlined
the stakes to me, N'vek.

635
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:33,417
Are you getting
squeamish now

636
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:34,750
just because
things are getting

637
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,458
a little more
dangerous?

638
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:43,959
Sensors are picking up

639
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,500
a polarized
magnetic distortion

640
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,458
to our portside.

641
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:48,959
Analysis.

642
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:51,417
The distortion is
extremely weak.

643
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:53,458
It appears to be
moving slowly.

644
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:56,709
It... it is gone, sir.

645
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:57,917
Gone?

646
00:32:57,917 --> 00:32:59,333
The distortion
no longer registers

647
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,625
on our instruments.

648
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:06,583
Could this distortion
be caused by a cloaked ship?

649
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:07,917
Unknown, sir.

650
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:09,709
Our understanding
of Romulan technology

651
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:10,875
is still limited.

652
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,625
Captain?

653
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:16,458
Romulan ships use
a forced quantum singularity

654
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,917
as a power source.

655
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:20,041
If that system is not
functioning perfectly

656
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,542
or is damaged
even slightly,

657
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,291
it might show
through the cloak

658
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:25,875
as a magnetic disturbance
of some kind.

659
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:28,083
The distortion has
reappeared, sir.

660
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,959
Bearing 337 mark 10.

661
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:32,458
It...

662
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:34,750
it has disappeared
again, sir.

663
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,458
Mr. Deseve,
in your opinion,

664
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:38,000
is it possible that
we're picking up

665
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,291
a cloaked
Romulan ship?

666
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,250
It's a strong
possibility, sir.

667
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,875
(<i> sighs</i> )

668
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:45,500
Mr. Data,
continue your scan.

669
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,834
Ensign, link
navigational control

670
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,542
to Mr. Data's console

671
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:52,834
and plot a course
for that distortion.

672
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:02,792
Commander,
the<i> Enterprise</i> is underway.

673
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:05,959
Good, what is
their course?

674
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:07,583
They're heading
for us, sir.

675
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:08,834
What?

676
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:10,917
They appear to be on
an intercept course.

677
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:15,792
What is the status
of our cloaking device?

678
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,083
Is there a malfunction
of any kind?

679
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:20,166
PILOT:
Cloaking device
functioning correctly, sir.

680
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,208
All shipboard emissions
within proper range.

681
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,583
TORETH:
Maintain full sensor scans.

682
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:24,917
Commander.

683
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:26,458
The<i> Enterprise</i> may
simply be engaged

684
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:28,458
in search operations.

685
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,125
Perhaps.

686
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,709
Where is it now,
Mr. Data?

687
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:35,792
DATA:
It has disappeared
once again, sir.

688
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:37,750
I believe it may have
been coming to a halt.

689
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,458
Stop engines.
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

690
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:40,917
If this is
a Romulan ship,

691
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:42,542
will it stay in position
until we leave?

692
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:43,959
I don't think so, sir.

693
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,750
A Romulan commander's
instinct

694
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,458
would be to attack.

695
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:49,250
Engage maneuvering
engines.

696
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,792
Forward 0.1.

697
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:54,041
Take us directly
under their hull.

698
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,333
Yes, Commander.

699
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,792
What are you doing?

700
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:59,166
It seems that
the<i> Enterprise</i>

701
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,500
can track us even though
we are cloaked.

702
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,542
I intend to find out
if they can or they cannot.

703
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:07,291
N'vek, ready
attack procedure.

704
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,208
Sir, disruptors are
standing by.

705
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,792
Ready to disengage cloak.

706
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,959
We cannot risk
an engagement here.

707
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:17,417
Considering the nature
of our mission,

708
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:20,041
I would have preferred
to have avoided it as well,

709
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:22,458
but I see no other
alternative.

710
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:24,125
What do you
intend to do?

711
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:28,291
We will pass as close
as we possibly can.

712
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:30,583
If they do have
the ability to track us,

713
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:33,709
they will move
to avoid a collision.

714
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:35,750
If they do...

715
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,667
I will destroy them.

716
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:51,542
Sir, the magnetic distortion
has reappeared.

717
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:53,333
Bearing and speed?

718
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,083
It appears to be
moving toward us,

719
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,542
closing slowly.

720
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:59,083
Its bearing indicates
a possible collision course.

721
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,041
RIKER:
Time to impact?

722
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:02,792
I am unable to get
a precise measurement.

723
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:05,667
However, I would estimate
impact within 90 seconds.

724
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:07,166
It doesn't
make any sense.

725
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,625
Why would they
run into us?

726
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,291
If they were, why would
they do it at full speed?

727
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,083
I don't know, sir.

728
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:15,000
The Romulans will sometimes
make suicide attacks

729
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,667
but only as
a last resort.

730
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:19,291
There's no reason
for it here.

731
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,709
DATA:
Time to impact
approximately 60 seconds.

732
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:23,667
We don't have the luxury
to speculate.

733
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:26,083
Back us away from
the disruption, Ensign--

734
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,250
one-half impulse.

735
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,375
Aye, sir.

736
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,333
They are moving away,
commander.

737
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,792
Prepare attack sequence.

738
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,875
All sections report ready
for battle, Commander.

739
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,917
Disruptors
fully charged.

740
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:38,000
Disengage cloak
on my command.

741
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,125
Prepare to fire...
Disregard that order.

742
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,166
What?

743
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,959
I do not authorize
this attack.

744
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:46,208
You will cease battle
operations immediately.

745
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,417
I do not need
your authorization

746
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:51,375
to attack, Major--
this is my ship.

747
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,792
How typical of the military
to resort to brute force

748
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,625
when discretion is
required.

749
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:58,709
The<i> Enterprise</i> has
demonstrated that

750
00:36:58,709 --> 00:36:59,792
it can track us.

751
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:01,166
They must be
destroyed.

752
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:03,625
Yes, they can track us,

753
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:07,041
so, if we attack them,
they will return fire,

754
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:09,125
and since
we have no shields

755
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:12,500
when we're cloaked,
they will destroy us.

756
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,291
Are you questioning
my ability to command?

757
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:17,417
You are not fit
to command.

758
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:20,542
Step down.

759
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,333
Step down, or I will
have you removed.

760
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:30,583
Do you think anyone here
will listen to you?

761
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:37,250
If any one of you
defies the Tal Shiar,

762
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,125
you will not bear
the punishment alone.

763
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:42,792
Your families,
all of them,

764
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:45,250
will be there
beside you.

765
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:49,667
I am now commander
of this ship-- you will

766
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,250
take orders from me
and no one else.

767
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:56,041
Remove Commander Toreth
from her station.

768
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,542
If she resists,
shoot her.

769
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:12,166
Commander...
please step down.

770
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,333
Remove her weapon.

771
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:37,000
Now, Commander...

772
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,166
watch and learn.

773
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:42,041
In order
to defeat your enemy,

774
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,375
you must first
understand them.

775
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:48,250
The Federation wishes
to avoid war at all costs,

776
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:53,250
so I will offer them
a diplomatic solution--

777
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,250
get them to lower
their shields...

778
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:00,125
and then...
destroy them.

779
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:08,208
Captain,
we are being hailed.

780
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:09,500
PICARD:
On screen.

781
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,375
I am Major Rakal
of the Tal Shiar.

782
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:19,083
I'm Jean-Luc Picard
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

783
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,375
How can we be of help?

784
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,250
A Corvallen freighter has been
destroyed not far from here.

785
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,125
We have detected
the residual effects

786
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:31,583
of disruptor fire.

787
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:33,333
Can you shed
any light on this?

788
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:35,917
A regrettable incident,
Captain.

789
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:37,500
The freighter
was fired upon

790
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,417
by the former commander
of this vessel.

791
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:42,125
I have now taken control,

792
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,208
and, I assure you,

793
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,166
there will be
no more attacks.

794
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,333
Still, there was
considerable loss of life.

795
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:51,792
Captain, we do not want
to exaggerate this incident.

796
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:55,083
You and I can
discuss it calmly.

797
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:59,166
We can defuse it before
it becomes inflated.

798
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,250
I agree.

799
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,000
I will come
onto your ship.

800
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,959
Please lower your shields
and prepare to beam me aboard.

801
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:08,208
Very well.

802
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,959
Mr. Worf,
lock onto Major Rakal.

803
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:12,083
Transport on my command.

804
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:13,125
Aye, sir.

805
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:15,250
Thank you.

806
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,750
What's she doing
on that ship?

807
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,542
I don't know,
Number One...

808
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:24,792
but she needs our help
to get back.

809
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:27,375
Mr. Worf, keep that lock on her,
no matter what happens.

810
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,542
Yes, sir.

811
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:31,959
Lower shields.

812
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:34,875
Their shields are
dropping.

813
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:37,458
Activate forward
disruptor array.

814
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:38,875
Fire when ready.

815
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:41,500
Yes, Major.
Firing.

816
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:46,625
WORF:
Captain,
they have fired on us.

817
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,208
Shields up.
Stand by phasers.

818
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:49,500
Damage report.

819
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,291
WORF:
we sustained a direct hit,

820
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:53,041
but the damage was
negligible.

821
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,000
The disruptor
had almost no power.

822
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,500
This is Proconsul M'ret
and his aides.

823
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,083
They're part
of the underground movement.

824
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:01,291
They're in stasis.
Medical team to the bridge.

825
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:02,500
MALE VOICE:
Aye, sir.

826
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,709
Where's Deanna?

827
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:06,750
Disruptors were
ineffective.

828
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,333
The<i> Enterprise</i> was
not damaged.

829
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,500
They have reestablished
full shields.

830
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,375
I am reading a malfunction
in the forward disruptor array.

831
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:15,667
The power system is
destabilized.

832
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:17,667
You're lying.

833
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:23,041
The disruptor beam has
been purposely sabotaged

834
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:24,959
to conceal
a transporter beam within.

835
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,166
Quickly, pilot.

836
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,250
Locate transport
coordinates.

837
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:34,000
What have you done?

838
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,417
PILOT:
The transporter beam originated

839
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:37,125
in our cargo bay.

840
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:39,667
Something was transported
from there to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

841
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:42,000
So, Major...

842
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,375
the mysterious cargo
brought on board

843
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,959
by Major Rakal
of the Tal Shiar

844
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:51,750
has been transported
to the Starfleet vessel.

845
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:55,917
I see two traitors
in our midst.

846
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,917
So, Major...

847
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,166
now that you can
no longer take refuge

848
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:15,750
behind the shield
of the Tal Shiar,

849
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,041
it's time to answer
a few questions.

850
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:20,875
What was in those
cargo containers?

851
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,875
Well, no matter.

852
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:30,208
We will soon know
all that we need to know...

853
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:32,792
and then we will
execute you.

854
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,000
Pilot, drop shields
and cloak the ship.

855
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,792
Prepare to go
to warp.

856
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,208
Aye, sir.

857
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:47,625
Mr. Worf, now.

858
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:54,834
Counselor.

859
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:56,166
Are you all right?

860
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:57,417
Yes.

861
00:42:57,417 --> 00:42:59,458
Let's get you
to sick bay.

862
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:03,542
Ensign, get us out of here--
warp nine.

863
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:05,291
Aye, sir.

864
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:13,500
Well,
that about does it.

865
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,583
How does it feel to have
your own face back?

866
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,000
Just right.
Thank you.

867
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:23,166
The men you helped rescue
are all safe.

868
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,583
Proconsul M'ret is deeply
grateful for your help.

869
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:28,333
The thanks should
go to N'vek.

870
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:32,125
He sacrificed himself
to save them... and me.

871
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,750
Well, thanks
to the two of you,

872
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,709
the way has been paved for
further rescue operations.

873
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:38,959
N'vek's efforts

874
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:41,625
and his sacrifice
were not in vain.
