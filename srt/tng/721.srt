1
00:00:01,542 --> 00:00:05,125
As time passes,
a boy inevitably becomes a man,

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:08,834
but what is<i> not</i> inevitable
is that a man become a warrior.

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,834
A warrior must be forged,
like a sword,

4
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:15,250
tempered by...

5
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:18,166
by...

6
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,458
tempered by experience.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,000
The path of the warrior
begins with--

8
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,542
(<i> giggling</i> )
Alexander?

9
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,250
No! Wait!

10
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,583
(<i> child giggling</i> )

11
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:33,917
Sorry.

12
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,417
I didn't mean to hit<i> you.</i>

13
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,333
What is the meaning of this?

14
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,709
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,667
We made fullerenes
in chemistry class today

16
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:49,041
and filled them
with water.

17
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,291
I asked you to meet me here
after school.

18
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,875
I have been waiting
for you.

19
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:54,834
I forgot.

20
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,875
You forgot because
you allowed yourself

21
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:58,709
to be distracted
by foolishness.

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,083
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:03,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

24
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:04,959
There is something
very important

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,125
I want to discuss
with you.

26
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,583
It concerns
your future.

27
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,667
Sit.

28
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:15,709
As time passes,

29
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,458
a boy inevitably
becomes a man,

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,000
but what is
not inevitable

31
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,875
is that a man
becomes a sword.

32
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,083
What?

33
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,333
No, I meant...
warrior.

34
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,000
The path of
a warrior begins

35
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,959
with the First
Rite of Ascension.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,583
Is that when they hit you
with painstiks?

37
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,583
No. No, that is
the Second Rite.

38
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,458
Oh.
You are approaching

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,959
the Age of Ascension.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,750
It is time for you to
prepare for the ceremony.

41
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,625
What do I have to do?

42
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:46,458
Well, your fighting
skills will be tested,

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,542
and your knowledge of
the teachings of Kahless.

44
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,458
It will be
challenging,

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,834
but I will help you
prepare.

46
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:58,000
These are the
<i>kor'tova</i> candles.

47
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,917
They represent
the fire that burns

48
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,875
within the heart
of a warrior.

49
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:04,166
When you light yours,

50
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,250
you<i> will</i> be declaring
your intention

51
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,500
to become a warrior.

52
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,750
Go ahead.

53
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:13,291
What if I don't
want to?

54
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,208
If you do not
participate in the rite

55
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,583
before the age of 13 years,
you will never be able

56
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,792
to become a true
Klingon warrior.

57
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:24,208
Well, I don't care
about that.

58
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,667
You may not care
about it now,

59
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,041
but someday you might.

60
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,333
Well, Mother always
said that--

61
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,583
that I didn't have to
do any of

62
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,625
this Klingon stuff
if I didn't want to.

63
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,792
It is your decision,
but--

64
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:35,959
Okay, then.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,291
I'm not going to
do it.

66
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,083
Alexander.

67
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,041
You just said
it was up to me.

68
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,250
I don't want to be
a warrior.

69
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:24,959
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,166
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship Enterprise.</i>

71
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,792
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

72
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:34,625
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

73
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:39,041
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

74
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:43,041
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

75
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,917
As a result, we won't
be able to rendezvous

76
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,000
with the<i> Kearsarge</i> 
for another four days.

77
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,083
Will we be holding position
here until it arrives?

78
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,291
Yes, and as
it would seem

79
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,166
that we're in for
a relatively quiet time,

80
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,542
I shall use
this opportunity

81
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,834
to visit
the Hatarian system.

82
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,875
There are some
ancient ruins

83
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,709
that are just
being excavated.

84
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,500
The delay will also
make it possible

85
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:01,250
for stellar dynamics
to complete their study

86
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,458
of the Vodrey Nebula.

87
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,792
I'll let them know
that they can have

88
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,041
more access to the
lateral sensor grid.

89
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,458
We could use
this time

90
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,542
to recalibrate the weapons
targeting system.

91
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,959
Mr. Worf?

92
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,667
Yes, um...

93
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,875
I will begin
the procedure immediately.

94
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,625
Very good.
Dismissed.

95
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,500
Lieutenant?

96
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:29,875
Could I have a word
with you for a moment?

97
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,208
I noticed several times
during the briefing

98
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,000
that you appeared
to be a bit distracted.

99
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,250
I apologize.

100
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,542
In the future,
I will make sure

101
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,792
my personal
affairs do not

102
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,291
interfere with
my duties.

103
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,250
Is everything
all right?

104
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:51,083
I'm having problems
with Alexander.

105
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,917
He has made it clear
he does not wish

106
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,250
to participate in the
First Rite of Ascension.

107
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,417
Oh, I see.

108
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,625
I tried to tell him
that it is

109
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,458
an important part of
a young Klingon's life,

110
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,750
but... he does
not understand.

111
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:05,125
But he's had
so little opportunity

112
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,917
to spend time
with Klingons.

113
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,583
You know, the Festival
of<i> Kot'baval</i> is tomorrow.

114
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,083
If he could
take part in that,

115
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm sure he would
more fully appreciate

116
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,458
what a rich cultural
heritage he comes from.

117
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,583
There<i> is</i> the Klingon
outpost on Maranga IV.

118
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,291
I'm sure they'll be
celebrating the festival.

119
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,208
Yes...

120
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,125
but the outpost is
on the other side

121
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,542
of the Vodrey Nebula.

122
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,250
It would take three days
by shuttle to get there.

123
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,750
Oh, the<i> Enterprise</i> 
could be there

124
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:37,208
in a fraction of the time,
and still back

125
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,417
in time for
the rendezvous.

126
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,667
Captain, I could
not ask you--

127
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:41,250
Mr. Worf, stellar dynamics
would like

128
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,750
nothing better than
a trip around the nebula.

129
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:46,709
Thank you, sir.

00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,291
There is only one man who
can stand against Molor.

183
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,750
♪ Nik'tol Kahless... ♪

184
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,583
It's Kahless!

185
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,750
Kahless would rather die

186
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,709
than live under
Molor's tyranny.

187
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,750
♪ Molor gik'tal! ♪

188
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,834
<i>Ni'lot Kahless!</i>

189
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,041
(<i> distant music and laughter</i> )

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,792
Father!

191
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,000
Where have you been?

192
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,875
We were watching
the fire dancers.

193
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:05,041
We?
K'nor and Bar'el.

194
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,709
They live here
on the outpost.

195
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,750
I need some money.

196
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,208
What for?

197
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,458
Well, a man over there
says he has

198
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,166
Molor's head in a box--
the real Molor.

199
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,375
That is impossible.

200
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,750
The real Molor died
centuries ago.

201
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:20,458
I know-- it's mummified.

202
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,166
He offered to show us
for 50 darseks.

203
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,250
He is trying
to take your money.

204
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,041
Please, Father,
he's waiting.

205
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,417
No, it is too late.

206
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,792
We should go home.
But I--

207
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,458
Alexander,
that is enough.

208
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,709
Come, it is time
to go.

209
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,041
I have to say good-bye
to my friends.

210
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,333
You can see your friends
again tomorrow.

211
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,500
We're coming back?

212
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,208
If you want to.

213
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,917
(<i> speaking Klingon</i> )

214
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,875
Ah!

215
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,750
Run, Alexander!

216
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:00,792
(<i> grunting and groaning</i> )

217
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,458
<i>Ni'tokor bak'to!</i>

218
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:23,542
<i>K'pla,</i> Worf.

219
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,417
You were too much
for them.

220
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,625
I have seen you before.

221
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,000
Who are you?

222
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,041
A friend.

223
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,000
You are K'mtar.

224
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,959
Your brother sent me
here to protect you.

225
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,500
He is<i> gin'tak</i> 
to the House of Mogh.

226
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:50,792
<i>Gin'tak?</i>

227
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,041
An adviser so trusted,

228
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,583
he has become
part of the family.

229
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,333
Do you have any idea who
was behind the attack?

230
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,625
It is a Klingon matter.

231
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,333
It is not
your concern.

232
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,709
One of my officers
was almost killed.

233
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,291
That makes it
my concern.

234
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:10,709
Recently, rumors began
to circulate on the homeworld

235
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,500
that an assassination attempt
was going to be made

236
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,417
on the family of Mogh.

237
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:19,125
Kurn sent me here to make sure
nothing happened to Worf.

238
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,625
Why didn't you warn him
before the attack was made?

239
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,375
I tried to contact him
over subspace.

240
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:26,875
I was told
he was not aboard.

241
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:30,083
I decided to beam directly
to the surface.

242
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,125
And why didn't you
let us know about it?

243
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,625
Forgive me for being blunt,
Commander,

244
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,000
but when it comes
to protecting the House

245
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:41,166
to which I have pledged
<i>my life...</i>

246
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,500
I trust no one.

247
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,917
I have full confidence

248
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,083
in the officers
with whom I serve.

249
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,709
One of the attackers
dropped this dagger.

250
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,166
The design represents
the house of Duras.

251
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,750
We have other evidence
that indicate

252
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:05,500
the Duras sisters,
Lursa and B'etor

253
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,792
were behind
the attack.

254
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:09,375
What do you think
they were after?

255
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:11,959
Kurn's seat on the council,
of course.

256
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,875
We cannot allow their attack
on our house to go unanswered.

257
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:18,333
First, we must find them.

258
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,667
At one point,
they were on Deep Space 9

259
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:23,333
trying to sell
bilitrium explosives.

260
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,166
That was months ago.

261
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,458
No one knows
where they went from there.

262
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,333
Maybe we can
find them.

263
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,417
We've arranged for
quarters on the ship

264
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,792
if you'd like
to stay.

265
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,333
I would.

266
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,709
Worf and I have much
to discuss.

267
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,834
I will send Kurn a message
telling him what happened,

268
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,917
but he will not
receive it for days.

269
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,291
He's gone to
the Hitora colony--

270
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,583
Why did you treat
Commander Riker

271
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,291
so disrespectfully?

272
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,625
You were rude!

273
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:08,542
I may have been rude
by human standards.

274
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,375
I meant no disrespect.

275
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,750
What is the
matter, Worf?

276
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:17,041
Have you been living
so long among humans

277
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:21,208
that you have forgotten
how Klingons behave?

278
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,750
I have not forgotten.
I am merely stating

279
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,792
that their ways are
different than ours.

280
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,041
I trust you have
made your son

281
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,750
aware of that fact,
as well.

282
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,583
Yes, of course
I have.

283
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,291
Good.

284
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,041
Because someday,
Alexander

285
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:38,208
may be called upon
to lead the House of Mogh.

286
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,291
Kurn has no male heir.

287
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,500
He wants to make sure

288
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,125
that Alexander
is preparing himself.

289
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,583
Does my brother doubt

290
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,333
my ability to raise
my son as a Klingon?

291
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,542
No.

292
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,709
But you are alone
among humans.

293
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,667
It cannot be easy
to keep our ways.

294
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,417
No.

295
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,917
It has not been easy.

296
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,458
How are his
fighting skills?

297
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,166
Can he handle
a<i> bat'leth?</i>

298
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,458
He is learning.

299
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,834
He could be better.

300
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,500
He must.

301
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,125
He is nearing
the Age of Ascension.

302
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:23,083
Actually, Alexander
has not yet committed himself

303
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,959
to undergoing the rite.

304
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,792
What?

305
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,166
I have tried
to explain to him

306
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,875
how important
it is, but...

307
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:32,667
he will not
listen to me.

308
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:38,041
Perhaps together,

309
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,792
you and I,

310
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,375
we can find
a way to spark

311
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,208
the boy's interest
in his heritage.

312
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:48,875
I would be grateful for
any help you could offer.

313
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,000
Tomorrow, then.

314
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,750
Tomorrow.

315
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,834
May I say good night
to the boy?

316
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,542
Yes, of course.

317
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,542
Is this your mother?

318
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,750
Yeah.

319
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,500
She died when
I was little.

320
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,458
You miss her a great
deal, don't you?

321
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,000
It must be
hard for you

322
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,917
being the only Klingon
your age aboard this ship.

323
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,208
Sometimes.

324
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,583
Have you ever been
to the homeworld?

325
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,709
No.

326
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,875
I think you would
like it there.

327
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,917
At your uncle's house,
there is a lake

328
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,834
you can swim in
that is so clear

329
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,959
you can see all
the way to the bottom.

330
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,166
ALEXANDER:
Really?

331
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,625
Mm-hmm.
You have cousins there.

332
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,166
They want to meet you.

333
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,458
I don't know.

334
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,125
I understand.

335
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,709
You're afraid.

336
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,041
You don't know whether
the homeworld is safe.

337
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,291
Yeah.

338
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,458
And what happened today

339
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,834
on the planet
is frightening.

340
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,667
You're still troubled.

341
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:12,125
I thought they were going
to kill my father.

342
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,208
You must have wanted

343
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,750
to help us
fight them off.

344
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,458
I didn't know
what to do.

345
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,083
Someday,
if you work hard,

346
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,125
you will become
a warrior--

347
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,125
a Klingon warrior.

348
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,417
And you will always
feel safe

349
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:33,000
because you will know
how to defend yourself.

350
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,834
And I'll tell you
something else.

351
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,709
If anyone
ever tries

352
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,750
to hurt your
father again,

353
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:41,750
you will be able to fight
at his side

354
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,792
and make sure
nothing happens to him.

355
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,083
What do you think of that?

356
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,125
Good night, Alexander.

357
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,041
Dream well.

358
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,000
Good night, K'mtar.

359
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,333
Any luck?

360
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,125
Starfleet records
contain no mention

361
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,041
of the Duras sisters
after their departure

362
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,917
from Deep Space 9.

363
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:30,667
Did I not
tell you as much?

364
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,709
Have you been able
to contact Deep Space 9?

365
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,917
I am being patched through
right now, sir.

366
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:36,291
On screen.

367
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,542
Quark, I see
you remember me.

368
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,291
How could I forget
the only man ever to win

369
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,959
triple-down dabo
at one of my tables?

370
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,291
And how can I forget
that you didn't have

371
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,417
enough latinum
to cover my winnings?

372
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,875
I thought I explained

373
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:52,792
that my brother misplaced
the key to the safe.

374
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:55,500
Besides, those vouchers
I gave you

375
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,208
were every bit
as good as latinum.

376
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,000
You can spend latinum
almost anywhere.

377
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,417
Those vouchers are
only good at your bar.

378
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:06,208
Is, um... that what
this is about?

379
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,500
You're on your way
and you're calling

380
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,583
to reserve
a holosuite program?

381
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,041
Actually, I was hoping you could
help me with something else.

382
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,458
What would that be?

383
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,542
I'm looking for
some Klingon friends of mine--

384
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,458
the Duras sisters,
Lursa and B'etor.

385
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,250
Yes!
Lursa and B'etor.

386
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,083
Big talk, small tips.

387
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,834
Do you know
where I can find them?

388
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:35,792
Well, I did hear
a rumor, actually.

389
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,375
What kind of rumor?

390
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,667
Oh, I don't know.

391
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:40,250
I'm sure it was told me
in confidence.

392
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,083
And how much would
your confidence cost?

393
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,792
How many vouchers
do you have again?

394
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,834
I have enough
for 12 bars of latinum.

395
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,959
I'd be glad
to return them.

396
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,041
I believe the rumor was

397
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,417
that the sisters
were trying to buy

398
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,625
some secondhand
mining equipment.

399
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:03,375
What for?
They learned of

400
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:06,792
a magnesite deposit on
the Kalla system.

401
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,083
It belongs to the Pakleds,

402
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,166
but those fools don't
even know it's there.

403
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,166
Your, uh, friends
are trying to get at it.

404
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,500
All right.

405
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:17,834
I'll send those vouchers
to you.

406
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,834
Oh, don't bother.

407
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,333
I voided them while
we've been talking.

408
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,125
So long, Quark.

409
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,417
How long would it take us
to get to the Kalla system?

410
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,834
Approximately
16 hours, sir.

411
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,542
Could not
he have been lying?

412
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,458
Why would he?

413
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,250
I'd just be knocking
on his door again in a few days,

414
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,166
and I wouldn't be in
as good a mood.

415
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,250
Uh-huh.

416
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,125
Congratulations,
Commander.

417
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,208
I did not think
it would be possible

418
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,083
to find the sisters.

419
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,583
Take us out of orbit.

420
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,625
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

421
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,417
I took the liberty

422
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,041
of creating a
holodeck program.

423
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,250
What kind of program?

424
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,583
I'll show you.

425
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,625
Computer, run program
K'mtar alpha one.

426
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,041
Program initiated.
Enter when ready.

427
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:22,375
Why did you want
to recreate this?

428
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:24,458
You said you wished
you had been able

429
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,917
to help
your father fight,

430
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:28,250
but you did not
know how.

431
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,000
You have probably
fought that battle

432
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,041
over and over again
in your mind.

433
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,792
Yes.

434
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:36,959
Let's see
what happens now.

435
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,959
Computer, give me
two Klingon warriors!

436
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,375
How can I fight
someone that big?

437
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:50,041
Size is not
the most important thing.

438
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,375
Skill, cunning,
powers of observation

439
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:56,375
are the most
important weapons.

440
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,583
<i>Ni'tokor bak'to!</i>

441
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:02,625
(<i> grunting and groaning</i> )

442
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:14,125
Freeze program.

443
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:19,417
Look what this
<i>ko'tal</i> is doing, hmm.

444
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:25,542
You see his leg?

445
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,000
That will give you
a clue

446
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,041
as to what
his next move will be.

447
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,375
All his weight is
on his right foot.

448
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:35,333
Yes, he is going to have to
shift it to regain his balance.

449
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,458
Stand ready!

450
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:44,375
Computer, resume program.

451
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:47,250
(<i> grunting and groaning</i> )

452
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,709
<i>Po'tajg! Po'tajg!</i>

453
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,834
Finish him.

454
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,375
(<i> growling</i> )

455
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:05,583
K'MTAR:
Freeze program!

456
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,417
You should have killed him
when you had the chance.

457
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,834
Why did you not?

458
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,458
I-- I don't know.

459
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,041
Look at him!

460
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,583
He did not care that
you showed him mercy!

461
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,125
He was going to
kill you!

462
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,250
K'mtar, that is enough.

463
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:29,166
If this was real,
he'd be dead by now.

464
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,375
Alexander!

465
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,750
We are approaching
Kalla III.

466
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:43,625
Set a standard orbit.

467
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,583
Any evidence of
a mining expedition?

468
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,959
A shaft has been cut
through the outer crust.

469
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,500
There is evidence
of machinery,

470
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:52,500
but it does not appear
to be in use.

471
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:53,750
Life signs?

472
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,125
It is difficult to say.

473
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,917
The magnesite is interfering
with bio-readings.

474
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,875
Assemble an away team.

475
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,458
Who are you?

476
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,250
Gorta.
I'm Gorta.

477
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,834
What are you doing
on this planet?

478
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,125
I crashed here.

479
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,834
DATA:
Then you are denying
involvement

480
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,417
in illegal mining
activities?

481
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:41,166
GORTA:
Mining?

482
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:44,250
So, that's what all
this equipment is here for.

483
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,291
We are looking
for two Klingon women.

484
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,625
Sisters.

485
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,417
Lursa? B'etor?

486
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:50,959
Do you know
where they are?

487
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,834
Actually, we were
hoping that you did.

488
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,875
M-Maybe I do.

489
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:02,125
Would you be willing to share
your information with us?

490
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:06,875
My personal code of conduct
prohibits sharing.

491
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:09,333
But I'd consider
a trade.

492
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,250
Does your personal code
of conduct tell you

493
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,083
that when you're stranded
on a planet with no way off

494
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,792
you shouldn't try
to cut deals?

495
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:17,917
You have a point.

496
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,959
We could certainly provide
passage off this planet

497
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,458
in exchange
for information.

498
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,583
Could you perhaps
fail to tell the Pakleds

499
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,542
that we were mining
their ore?

500
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:31,000
LA FORGE:
Don't push your luck.

501
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,250
But if you get us
the Duras sisters,

502
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,583
I'll see what
I can do.

503
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:37,125
Ahh.

504
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,500
The Duras sisters.

505
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:44,792
Oh, they are magnificent,
aren't they?

506
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,208
Where are they now?

507
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,917
Selling the ore,
I imagine.

508
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:52,792
They took everything--
the ore, the ship.

509
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:55,166
And where have they gone?

510
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:57,542
We were going to sell the ore
to a Yridian trader.

511
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:01,333
We were supposed to meet him
in the Ufandi system.

512
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:02,792
Gather your belongings.

513
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:04,417
It is time to leave.

514
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,208
(<i> clanking</i> )

515
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,041
Like I said,
they took everything.

516
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,208
Worf...

517
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,417
I am sorry
about what happened.

518
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:30,125
I should not have
gotten so angry.

519
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,417
It's just that
I am...

520
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,583
worried about
Alexander.

521
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,542
As am I.

522
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,583
Kurn told me
that his mother

523
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:43,250
actively
discouraged him

524
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:46,166
exploring his Klingon
heritage.

525
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,709
When he first came
to live with me,

526
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,834
he knew nothing
of our ways.

527
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,500
He often reminds me

528
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:55,500
of the things his
mother said to him.

529
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:57,917
And I try not to
disregard her wishes.

530
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,709
I want the boy
to honor his mother.

531
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,542
Mm.
Someday, I'm sure,

532
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,083
he will appreciate you

533
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:07,125
and be grateful for all
that you have done for him.

534
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:10,625
But still, compared
to other boys his age,

535
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:13,625
his fighting skills
are years behind.

536
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,792
Yes, I know.

537
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:18,542
He does not put in
the time it takes

538
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,750
to learn the skills.
Mm.

539
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,667
I thought that you
might consider

540
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:25,500
sending him to the
training academy at Ogat.

541
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:27,667
Your brother is
an influential man.

542
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:28,917
I'm sure he could
see to it

543
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,959
that Alexander
was admitted.

544
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,375
Ogat...

545
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:35,291
I am only thinking of what
is best for the boy.

546
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,417
There he would learn
<i>our</i> ways.

547
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:41,583
He would live
like a Klingon.

548
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,250
I would like him
to learn our ways.

549
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:48,500
No.

550
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:50,792
<i>This</i> is his home.

551
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:53,500
How...

552
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:55,917
How can you expect him

553
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:59,500
to lead our family
when all he knows is life

554
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:01,875
aboard a Federation
starship?

555
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:03,375
He is my son.

556
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:04,625
He belongs with me.

557
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:07,458
The boy is more human
than Klingon.

558
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,792
If he stays here,
he will never be a warrior.

559
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,959
He will never
be able to defend

560
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,208
our family against
its enemies!

561
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,458
Enough! Enough!

562
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,458
Enough! The decision
is mine!

563
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,667
Not necessarily.

564
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:19,917
I would be well
within my rights

565
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,875
to invoke<i> ya'nora kor.</i>

566
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:26,291
You would question my fitness
to raise my own son?

567
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,959
For the good of
our house,

568
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,667
yes, Worf.

569
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:31,041
I beg of you,

570
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,834
please stop thinking
of yourself.

571
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:37,291
It is Alexander
we should be considering.

572
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,750
Look into your heart...

573
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:43,500
and do what is best
for him.

574
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,959
Kahless was determined
to teach his brother a lesson

575
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,166
because he had told
a lie.

576
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,542
But Morath refused
to fight him

577
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,917
and instead ran away.

578
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:07,917
Kahless pursued him
across the valleys,

579
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:09,166
over the mountains,

580
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,667
and down to
the edge of the sea.

581
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,542
And there, at the shore,
they fought for 12--

582
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:16,375
12 days, 12 nights.
I know.

583
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:18,375
I've heard
this story before.

584
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,875
Hmm.

585
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:23,750
Alexander, it is important
to tell these stories

586
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:26,542
even though
we already know them.

587
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,000
Well, why was
Kahless so mad

588
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,709
about the lie
his brother told?

589
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,208
It made him look
like a coward.

590
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,750
If Kahless would have just
explained what happened,

591
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,458
maybe they wouldn't
have had to fight about it.

592
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,875
You're missing
the point.

593
00:30:37,917 --> 00:30:40,709
Why was it so wrong
for Morath to run away?

594
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,208
Maybe he didn't want
to fight his brother

595
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,125
because he didn't want
to have to kill him.

596
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:47,917
He ran because
he was a coward.

597
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:49,125
But how do you
know that's why--

598
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:51,625
No, no, no, no.
No more questions.

599
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,709
These are our stories.

600
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,625
It is important for
a warrior to learn

601
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:58,875
how to interpret
them properly.

602
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,166
I'm trying to.

603
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,000
No, your head is filled

604
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:06,333
with foolish human notions
about how things are.

605
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,000
You are Klingon!

606
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:12,291
It is time you began
to act like one.

607
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,291
I am part human, too.

608
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:17,291
Listen to me,
Alexander.

609
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:21,125
When a human looks at you,
he does not see himself.

610
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,125
He sees a Klingon.

611
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,959
It doesn't matter
what I look like.

612
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,500
It does.

613
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:30,041
You are different than
everyone else aboard this ship.

614
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,542
That's not true!

615
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:32,917
It is.

616
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,959
The only way that
you will ever feel

617
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,542
as if you truly belong

618
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:38,834
is to leave here

619
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:42,333
and go and live
with your own kind.

620
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:54,000
I know a Klingon school
you could go to.

621
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:57,083
Oh, you would
be welcome there.

622
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,709
They would teach you
to be a warrior--

623
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,959
prepare you for
the Rite of Ascension.

624
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,291
I don't know if
I want to do that.

625
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:08,291
After you were there
for a while,

626
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,709
you would find that
you wouldn't want

627
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,333
to do anything else.

628
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,291
I don't want to leave
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

629
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,625
Alexander, you must!

630
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,583
Everything depends
upon it!

631
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:20,792
I thought
you were different.

632
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:26,166
I thought
you understood me,

633
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,417
but you don't!

634
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:28,750
You're just
like my father.

635
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:30,000
All you care about

636
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,375
is me becoming
a warrior.

637
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,750
Just leave me alone!

638
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:43,000
RIKER:
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47779.4.</i>

639
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:44,750
<i>We've entered</i>
<i>the Ufandi system</i>

640
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,625
<i>where we believe</i>
<i>the Duras sisters</i>

641
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:50,291
<i>might have come to sell the ore</i>
<i>they mined on Kalla III.</i>

642
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:52,625
I am detecting a vessel

643
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:54,792
holding position near
the third planet.

644
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,542
It is a Yridian
freighter.

645
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:57,875
Put it on screen.

646
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,625
RIKER:
Scan for magnesite
in its hold.

647
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,667
The resonance
signature indicates

648
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:08,166
that there<i> is</i> 
magnesite ore present.

649
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:10,792
Then we're too late.

650
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:12,333
The sisters have
already been here.

651
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,000
Somehow, I doubt the
Yridians are going to be

652
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:16,125
forthcoming about where
they might have gone.

653
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,667
DATA:
Sir...

654
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:19,542
readings indicate that
there are only 500

655
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,875
kilograms of ore in
the Yridian hold.

656
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,834
There should be
over 10,000 kilograms.

657
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:26,583
That's odd.
Hail them.

658
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:29,500
I'm Commander
William Riker from

659
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:31,667
the Federation starship
<i>Enterprise.</i>

660
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,792
I am Yog.

661
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:35,417
Why are we speaking?

662
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:36,667
Our sensors indicate

663
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:38,792
that you are carrying
magnesite ore.

664
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:41,083
Magnesite. Yes.

665
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:42,417
Where did you get it?

666
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,792
From a... Corvallan.

667
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,542
For a good price.

668
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:48,792
Where is this
Corvallan now?

669
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:51,959
I'm under orders
to acquire some magnesite.

670
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,500
Well, he is gone.

671
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:56,291
Where?
Who is to know?

672
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:58,834
Would you be interested
in selling me

673
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,333
the ore
that you're carrying?

674
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,500
No.

675
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:05,125
I have a buyer.

676
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:07,583
You haven't heard
my offer.

677
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:11,959
Half a gram
of Anjoran biomimetic gel.

678
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:15,583
Hmm.
Done.

679
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:19,709
Once we verify the purity
of your ore,

680
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,834
we'll beam over the gel.

681
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,333
You're up to something.

682
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:28,834
Have the transporter
room beam the ore

683
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,792
to these coordinates.

684
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:32,041
DATA:
Sir?

685
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,417
That would
place the ore

686
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,375
directly off the ship's
starboard bow.

687
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,709
I know.

688
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,291
Transport complete.

689
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,375
RIKER:
Lock the phasers
on the ore and fire.

690
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,625
Firing.

691
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:50,709
A Klingon Bird-of-Prey.

692
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,125
Put a tractor beam
on it.

693
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,583
How did you know?

694
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,792
The Yridians
had only part

695
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:56,000
of the shipment
in their hold.

696
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:57,417
I realized
that we had arrived

697
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:59,500
before they had completed
the transfer.

698
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:01,125
The Klingon ship
is hailing us.

699
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,542
On screen.

700
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,083
Release our vessel
at once!

701
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,709
I don't think so.

702
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,250
B'ETOR:
We've done nothing wrong.

703
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:12,041
We were engaging in a simple
business transaction.

704
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,417
We know you're dealing
in stolen ore...

705
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:19,333
but I want to talk
about the assassination attempt

706
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,750
on Lieutenant Worf.

707
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:23,542
What assassination
attempt?

708
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:25,500
This is the first
I've heard of it.

709
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,208
Too bad it
didn't succeed!

710
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,834
(sisters laughing)

711
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,542
We have evidence
that you're behind it.

712
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:34,000
That is outrageous!

713
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:36,291
What is this evidence?

714
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,792
Beam over.
We'll show you.

715
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:43,875
We'll be there...
shortly.

716
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:51,917
This was dropped by one
of the assassins.

717
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,125
It bears the crest
of your house.

718
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:57,583
<i>Ge'ko... kaf'la.</i>

719
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,625
Someone must have given
it to the assassins

720
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,542
to implicate us.
(<i> scoffs</i> )

721
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:03,458
Why would someone
do that?

722
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,625
B'ETOR:
In order

723
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,875
to tarnish
our good name.

724
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:09,125
You cannot tarnish
a rusted blade.

725
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,667
(<i> hissing</i> )
<i>Ji'ko to'val!</i>

726
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:12,000
<i>Gir'nak tovo'sor!</i>

727
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:14,083
RIKER:
Mr. Worf!

728
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:15,458
You said there was
other evidence

729
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,667
that they were involved?

730
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:19,291
Yes.
On the homeworld.

731
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,625
We'll set a course.
I want this thing cleared up.

732
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,750
I will send a message
to Kurn.

733
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:28,208
He may wish to return
to the homeworld, as well.

734
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,375
B'ETOR:
<i>Bet'ala nog'tor.</i>

735
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,333
Impossible!

736
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,667
What is it?

737
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:43,417
These markings represent
the members of our house.

738
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:47,959
This symbol represents our
father, myself, my sister...

739
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,125
and<i> this...</i>

740
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,083
represents... her<i> son.</i>

741
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,375
I was not aware
you had a son.

742
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:59,083
I do not.

743
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:01,458
But I am with child.

744
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,291
She found out
only a few days ago,

745
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:07,041
and told no one
but me.

746
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:10,041
How can this marking
be here?

747
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,959
Where did this come from?

748
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:19,000
I will speak with K'mtar.

749
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,333
(<i> grunts</i> )

750
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,250
Father...

751
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:49,333
stop!
I am your son.

752
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:54,959
I am Alexander.

753
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,750
What are you saying?

754
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:05,542
I am your son,
Alexander.

755
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,333
I have come to this time
from 40 years in the future.

756
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,792
<i>P'tak.</i> 
Tell me

757
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:12,750
the truth or I will
kill you.

758
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,208
Look at me.

759
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,750
When we first met,
you said I looked familiar.

760
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,375
I could have seen you
on the homeworld.

761
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:22,041
No!
Look closely.

762
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,291
I am your son.

763
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,041
If you are Alexander,
you will remember

764
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,625
your mother's last words
before she died.

765
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:37,291
I was three years old.

766
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,875
She was dying
when we found her.

767
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:44,458
She barely managed
to whisper my name,

768
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,834
and then she took my hand
and placed it in yours.

769
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,709
Then she died,

770
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:55,667
and then you
howled in rage...

771
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,208
and said,
"Look upon her.

772
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,959
"Look upon death

773
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,417
and always remember."

774
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,542
and I always have.

775
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:12,792
(<i> coughing</i> )

776
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:15,375
How have
you done this--

777
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:16,917
come to this time?

778
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:20,667
I met a man in
the Cambra system.

779
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:24,291
He gave me a chance
to change the past.

780
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,625
He had the ability

781
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,750
to send me here
to this time.

782
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:30,709
And you came here in order
to end your own life?

783
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,709
I was hoping that
I would not have to...

784
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,959
that I could
change things,

785
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,250
that I could
change myself.

786
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:41,834
But I could not.

787
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,792
And now, everything
is going to turn out

788
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:45,125
like it did before.

789
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:48,083
I cannot
let that happen.

790
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,291
But why? What is
going to happen

791
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,417
that is so terrible?

792
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:53,583
You will be killed,

793
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,333
because I was
too naive,

794
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:59,709
too weak to be able
to protect you.

795
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,917
I do not believe that.

796
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:04,542
I was there.

797
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:07,750
I saw you murdered!
I was to blame!

798
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,834
You must not
blame yourself.

799
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,792
You don't understand.

800
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:19,959
I did not become
a warrior.

801
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,333
I was a...

802
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:25,500
a diplomat, a peacemaker.

803
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:28,333
When it came my time
to lead our family,

804
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:31,000
I thought that
I could single-handedly

805
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:34,333
end the fighting between
the great houses.

806
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:36,375
I publicly announced
that the House of Mogh

807
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:38,667
would be the first
to end the feuding,

808
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:40,917
that there would
be no more retribution,

809
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,917
no more revenge.

810
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,208
You tried to warn me.

811
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,417
You tried to tell me

812
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,917
that I should not
show weakness,

813
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:50,458
but I thought you were
a foolish old man.

814
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,208
I told you you were a relic
from an earlier time,

815
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,750
and that a new era
of peace was at hand.

816
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,625
But you were right.

817
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:04,333
My enemies saw my weakness
and moved against me.

818
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,417
And unless
I stop it right now,

819
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:12,583
that boy will see his father
killed on the floor

820
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,166
of the great
council chamber.

821
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:17,709
Ah, that is why you wanted
to take Alexander away--

822
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,542
to turn him
into a warrior.

823
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:22,208
I staged
the assassination attempt

824
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,125
to try and frighten him,
to make him realize

825
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:28,250
that he must follow
the ways of the warrior.

826
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:30,458
If I had listened
to you--

827
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,041
if I had become
the warrior

828
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:35,250
that you had
wanted me to be--

829
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:41,917
you would not have died
in my arms.

830
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,667
No.

831
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:46,041
Who knows what
the future will be

832
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:48,250
now that you have
disrupted time?

833
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:51,041
I may die tomorrow,
or I may outlive you.

834
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,166
But when I die,

835
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,375
I would like
an honorable death.

836
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:56,208
And the only way
that is possible

837
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:00,250
is for you to accept
yourself as you are

838
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,667
and stay true
to what you believe.

839
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:05,417
The cause of peace
<i>is</i> a just cause.

840
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:07,750
The struggle
must continue.

841
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,458
It is a futile struggle.

842
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,875
I cannot change things.

843
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:14,041
You have already
changed things

844
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,917
more than you realize.

845
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:18,875
The boy I was
has not changed.

846
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:21,917
But I have.

847
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:25,417
You have given me a glimpse
into my son's future,

848
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:30,583
and I know now that
he has his own destiny.

849
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:36,709
And I believe it
will be a great one.

850
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:46,625
I love you, Father.

851
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:50,792
And I you, Alexander.

852
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:17,458
I have been waiting.

853
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,208
Where is K'mtar?

854
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,125
He had to leave.

855
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,583
He was called away.

856
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,375
He never said
good-bye.

857
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:27,917
He asked me to say
good-bye for him.

858
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:30,000
He also wanted me
to tell you,

859
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,750
no matter what happens,

860
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:34,625
no matter what you decide
to do with your life,

861
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:37,542
he will always care
for you a great deal.

862
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:40,333
When will
I see him again?

863
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:43,250
It may be a long time.

864
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,333
Well, we should
start practice.

865
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,959
Alexander...

866
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:54,500
there will be plenty
of time for training.
