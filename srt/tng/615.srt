1
00:00:01,291 --> 00:00:02,625
Bring the stasis
units in here

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:03,917
and have them on line.
MAN: Yes, Doctor.

3
00:00:03,917 --> 00:00:05,750
Tell Dr. Selar she
can use Ward Three

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,625
for the ambulatory patients,
and I'll stay here--

5
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:09,291
MAN: Transporter Room Four
to Sick Bay.

6
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:10,792
They're coming in now.

7
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:12,917
Acknowledged.
Stand clear and be ready.

8
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,500
MAN: All right.
Let's go, let's go.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,083
Get him up here.

10
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,375
What happened?

11
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,250
The Lenarians
attacked us

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,959
outside of the
conference room.

13
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:30,375
CRUSHER:
He's in cardiac arrest.

14
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,333
Connect the pulmonary
support unit.

15
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,166
He's got internal
hemorrhaging.

16
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,875
The bioregulator of
his artificial heart

17
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,750
has been fused,
he's got liver

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,625
and spleen damage.

19
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,375
What kind of weapon
caused this?

20
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,542
A compressed teryon beam.

21
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:48,458
40 cc's inaprovaline.

22
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,834
The activity in the
isocortex is falling.

23
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:57,834
Cortical stimulators.

24
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,250
Now.

25
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:05,834
Again.

26
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,000
His respiratory system
is shutting down.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,250
The levels in the isocortex
are still falling.

28
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,917
Damn!

29
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:19,041
Prepare a cordrazine series...

30
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,250
Welcome to the afterlife,
Jean-Luc.

31
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,750
You're dead.

32
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:33,291
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

33
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:37,417
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

34
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,208
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

35
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:43,125
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

36
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:47,709
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

37
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,250
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

38
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:53,959
Q, what is going on?

39
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:54,959
I told you.

40
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,500
You're dead,

41
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,041
this is the afterlife,
and I'm God.

42
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,875
You are not God.

43
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,625
Blasphemy! You're lucky
I don't cast you out

44
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,458
or smite you or something.

45
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,000
The bottom line is

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,875
your life ended
about five minutes ago

47
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,500
under the inept ministrations
of Dr. Beverly Crusher.

48
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,959
No.

49
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,834
I am not dead...
because I refuse

50
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:26,458
to believe that the
afterlife is run by you.

51
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,667
The universe is not
so badly designed.

52
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:32,333
Very well.
If you really require

53
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,417
more evidence of your
postmortem status,

54
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,500
I guess I'll just
have to provide you some.

55
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,834
MAN:
Jean-Luc, I told you

56
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:42,166
not to go running off
to that academy.

57
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,250
Father.

58
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,458
I told you
that Starfleet

59
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:50,208
would bring you to a bad end,
but you wouldn't listen.

60
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,792
Now, look at you--

61
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,709
dead before your time.

62
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,000
Q, enough of this.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,875
Enough what?

64
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,083
Why couldn't you have listened?

65
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,375
Didn't you know

66
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,667
that I was working for
your best interests?

67
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,041
Q, stop this!

68
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,792
After all these years,

69
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:13,792
even now, you manage to
disappoint me, Jean-Luc.

70
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,583
He's not the only one
who would like to have

71
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,041
a word with you.

72
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,250
WOMAN 1:<i> Why, Jean-Luc?</i>
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

73
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,834
WOMAN 2:<i> Captain, there are</i>
<i>still people down there,</i>

74
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,375
<i>we can't abandon...</i>
MAN 1:<i> There must be</i>

75
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,875
<i>some other way, Captain,</i>
<i>some other choice</i>

76
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,625
<i>than firing on them.</i>
MAN 2:<i> I'm warning you.</i>

77
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,458
<i>If you continue on this...</i>
MAN 3:<i> A direct hit, sir.</i>

78
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,875
<i>The ship is destroyed.</i>

79
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,083
These are the voices
of all the people

80
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,417
you've killed
throughout the years.

81
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,917
Whom I've killed?
What do you mean?

82
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:40,041
Death has made you a
little dim, Jean-Luc.

83
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,792
These are the voices
of all the people

84
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:44,333
who have died...
through your actions

85
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,125
or your inactions.

86
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,208
Now, if you have any words
of apology or regret,

87
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,166
I believe
they're all listening.

88
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,583
They're a surly bunch, actually,

89
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,250
so I wouldn't drag
this out too long.

90
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,000
I have no intention of
performing for your amusement.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,041
This is not for me,
this is for you, Jean-Luc.

92
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:02,500
This is your opportunity to make
peace with your sordid past.

93
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,125
I find it hard
to believe

94
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,959
that you are doing this
for the benefit of my soul.

95
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:08,291
Well, now that you've shuffled
off the mortal coil,

96
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,583
we're free to spend a
little time together.

97
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:14,542
"A little time together."
How much?

98
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,291
Eternity.

99
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,125
Now, you're sure
you have no regrets

100
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,375
or feelings of guilt about
your former life?

101
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,166
I mean, I can't
have you whining

102
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,667
and complaining
through time.

103
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,709
If I'm really dead,
then my only regret

104
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,750
is dying and
finding you here.

105
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,250
You wound me,
Jean-Luc.

106
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,000
After all, I was not
the cause of your death.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,375
This was.

108
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,208
Is that--

109
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,291
Your artificial heart.

110
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,041
You might have lived
if you had a real one

111
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:50,166
instead of this unreliable
piece of technology.

112
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,834
By the way, how did you
lose yours, anyway?

113
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,500
A mistake.

114
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,208
Is that a regret I hear?

115
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,417
I regret many things
from those days.

116
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:05,000
Really?

117
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,583
(<i> loud grunting</i> )

118
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:15,583
(<i> grunting and groaning</i> )

119
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,375
(<i> laughing</i> )

120
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,125
Wasn't very smart of you
to take on three Nausicaans,

121
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,667
was it?

122
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,542
No, it wasn't.

123
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:50,458
And did I hear a laugh?

124
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,500
It's so unlike you, Jean-Luc,
to have a sense of humor--

125
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,375
especially about getting
stabbed through the back.

126
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,458
I was a different person
in those days--

127
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,000
arrogant,
undisciplined...

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
with far too much ego

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,250
and far too little
wisdom.

130
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,792
I was more like you.

131
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:12,166
Then you must have been
far more interesting.

132
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,709
Pity you had to change.

133
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:17,166
The pity is that I had to
be impaled through the back

134
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,750
before I learned
that lesson.

135
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,000
I started that fight
with those Nausicaans.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,291
I started it because...

137
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,375
because I was
young and cocky.

138
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,500
If I'd been more
responsible in those days,

139
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,458
I wouldn't have
needed this heart.

140
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,750
And I wouldn't have died

141
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,125
from a random energy
surge 30 years later.

142
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,375
So, if you had to
do it all over again?

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,917
Things would be different.

144
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,834
(<i> laughter</i> )

145
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,500
(<i> clapping</i> )

146
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,166
Bravo, bravo.

147
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,959
Nicely done.

148
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:09,875
Cortin?
Cortin Zweller?

149
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,750
Yes.

150
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,750
Boy, she must have
hit you pretty hard.

151
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,250
Of course,
you deserved it.

152
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,333
Slowing down there,
Johnny.

153
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,959
You should have seen
that one coming.

154
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,542
Marta Batanides.

155
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,500
Are you okay?

156
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,041
Yes, I'm fine.

157
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:32,834
I'm, uh... I'm just a little
disoriented, that's all.

158
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:35,625
Oh, come on, he's just
playing for sympathy now.

159
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,250
Look, I'm gonna get
something to eat

160
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,834
and head over to the
casino at Bonestell.

161
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,041
You coming?

162
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:44,333
Uh... I'll catch up
with you there.

163
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,375
You sure you're okay?

164
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,125
Yes, I'm fine.
Really, Marta, I'm fine.

165
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,458
Come on, Marty.

166
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,500
I'll bet he's got
another date.

167
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,458
That's it, isn't it?

168
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,709
You are incorrigible.

169
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:13,041
Attention on deck,
Ensign Picard.

170
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,375
Q.

171
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,500
That's Captain Q
to you, young man.

172
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,458
What is the point of
creating this fantasy?

173
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,166
This is no fantasy,
I assure you.

174
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,083
It's all very real.

175
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,625
You're 21 years old again.

176
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:31,375
A brash young man,
fresh out of the academy.

177
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,041
I certainly
don't look it.

178
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,166
Well...

179
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,375
to everyone else, you do.

180
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:50,417
So, Q, I thought you
told me that I was dead.

181
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,834
Now, it seems
that I'm alive.

182
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,625
Oh, you mortals
are so obtuse.

183
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,250
Why do you persist
in believing

184
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,125
that life and death are such
static and rigid concepts?

185
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:02,333
Why, I can take your life
and give it back to you again

186
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,750
with the snap
of a finger.

187
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,208
Let's say for the moment
that may be true.

188
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,917
What is the purpose
in bringing me here?

189
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:14,375
You said you regretted a great
many things in your life.

190
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,834
Well, here's a chance
to change some of them.

191
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,208
Change them?

192
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,000
Do you mean, change the past?

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,834
Q, even if
you have been able

194
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,917
to bring me back
in time somehow,

195
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,917
surely, you must realize that
any alteration

196
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,709
in this timeline will have

197
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,333
a profound impact
on the future.

198
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,875
Please, spare me your
egotistical musings

199
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,792
on your pivotal
role in history.

200
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,458
Nothing you do
here will cause

201
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,917
the Federation
to collapse

202
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,208
or galaxies to explode.

203
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:44,667
To be blunt,
you're not that important.

204
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,125
I won't do it.

205
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,208
I won't alter history.

206
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,000
Ah! Very well!

207
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,458
Since you attach
so much importance

208
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,041
to the continuity of time...

209
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,417
I will give you my
personal guarantee

210
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:07,333
that nothing you do here
will end up hurting anyone

211
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,667
or have an adverse effect on
what you know of as history.

212
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:13,375
The only thing at stake
here is your life

213
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,208
and your peace of mind.

214
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,458
Now...

215
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,750
whether you
believe me or not,

216
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,709
you are here, and you
have a second chance.

217
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,083
What you choose
to do with it

218
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,208
is entirely up to you.

219
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,291
Do you know
where you are?

220
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,834
Starbase Earhart.

221
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,917
We came here right
after graduation

222
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:40,125
to await our first
deep space assignments.

223
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,250
That's right.

224
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,875
It's two days before
your unfortunate encounter

225
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,834
with a Nausicaan sword.

226
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:50,333
You have that long to make
whatever changes you wish.

227
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,959
If you can avoid getting stabbed
through the heart this time--

228
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,417
which I doubt--

229
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:59,458
I will take you back to what
you think of as the present,

230
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,041
and you will go on
with your life,

231
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,917
with a<i> real</i> heart.

232
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,500
Then I won't die?

233
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,333
Of course, you'll die.

234
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,583
It will just be
at a later time.

235
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,667
What if I don't
avoid the fight?

236
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,208
What if I won't make
the changes?

237
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,667
Then you die
on the table

238
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,625
and we spend
eternity together.

239
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,083
Wonderful.

240
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,458
I'm glad you think so.

241
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,834
I'm curious about
one thing... Johnny.

242
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:30,667
Why did that rather
attractive woman

243
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:34,041
strike you just now--
was it something you said?

244
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,458
Her name was Corlina,

245
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:43,959
and... I'd arranged to
take her out today.

246
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,333
And then she
discovered that...

247
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,291
I had already made
a second date

248
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,542
with another woman
called, um...

249
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,583
...Penny.

250
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:02,250
And Corlina was
naturally upset.

251
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,000
I had no idea
you were such a cad.

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,750
I'm impressed.

253
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,834
Computer, what is
the time right now?

254
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:12,250
COMPUTER:
1611 hours.

255
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:19,166
In fact, Penny is waiting
for me... right now.

256
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:23,625
Well, carry on.

257
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:28,583
PENNY: Well, you're
awfully quiet today.

258
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,041
What happened to that
dashing young Ensign

259
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,333
from last night, hmm?

260
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,208
The one with
the winning smile

261
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,291
and the smooth talk
about my eyes?

262
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,750
(<i> both chuckle</i> )

263
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,834
I'm-- I'm just a little
more contemplative.

264
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:45,875
Hmm, and what are you
contemplating?

265
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,750
Penny, um...

266
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,625
do you think we could
just talk for a while?

267
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,208
I hardly know
anything about you.

268
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,000
Where you're from,
what your interests are,

269
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,917
your last name.

270
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:01,000
I come from Rigel,
my last name is Muroc,

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,208
and I like men in uniform.

272
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:08,083
I think that's
enough talking.

273
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,125
What's wrong?

274
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,792
I don't look as attractive
to you as I did last night?

275
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,834
No, no, not at all.

276
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:24,917
I think you're a
very handsome woman.

277
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:26,709
"Handsome."

278
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,542
That's something you
say to old ladies.

279
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,834
You're certainly
not an old lady.

280
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,166
I didn't want your pity.

281
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,041
(<i> blowing</i> )

282
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:51,000
Penny for your thoughts.

283
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,750
You never told me
you were such a ladies' man.

284
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,417
I wasn't.

285
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,959
I was a puerile adolescent
who allowed himself

286
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,166
to be led by his hormones,
instead of his head.

287
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,959
(<i> applause and cheering</i> )

288
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,000
Looks like your friends
know how to have fun.

289
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,959
You ought to take lessons.

290
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,875
Excuse me.

291
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,250

He's winning.

00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:39,208
Of course.

295
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,125
I thought you
had a date.

296
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,166
She... decided to leave.

297
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,250
You're getting old,
Johnny.

298
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:54,959
(<i> cheering</i> )

299
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,375
Thank you.

00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,917
Thank you all.
Thank you.

301
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,917
Very, very nice.

302
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:04,500
I think you should
forget about Starfleet

303
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,917
and play dom-jot
for a living.

304
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,333
Oh, this is nothing.

305
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,041
A little trigonometry,
some minor wrist action.

306
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,709
Now, barokie,
there's a game.

307
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,667
NAUSICAAN:
Human!

308
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,166
Play dom-jot, human?

309
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,875
I think I could
be persuaded

310
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,709
to play one more game.

311
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:38,875
(<i> growls</i> )

312
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:45,834
Corey, don't play him.

313
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:48,250
Why?
It'll cause trouble.

314
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,208
He's a Nausicaan.

315
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,291
They can get very
ill-tempered if they lose.

316
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,667
So can I.

317
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:55,917
No, Corey,
listen to me.

318
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:58,000
This is a big mistake.
Don't play him.

319
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,750
What's gotten into you?

320
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,917
Let's go.

321
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,458
I see you found your
Nausicaan friend.

322
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,375
You seem un-impaled so far.

323
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,083
I'm sorry to
disappoint you.

324
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,750

Looks good.

326

Look at that, yeah!

327
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:30,583
Ensign Zweller seems
to be doing well.

328
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,709
He's gonna lose.

329
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:34,792
The Nausicaan
is cheating.

330
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:36,000
Really?

331
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,792
I'm beginning to like
these Nausicaans.

332
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:40,750
If history repeats itself,

333
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,667
Corey will figure it
out later tonight,

334
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:46,417
and then he'll
want revenge.

335
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,208
And will you help
your best friend

336
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,125
avenge this injustice?

337
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,625
I did last time.

338
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,667

I rigged the table

339

so that he would win
in a rematch.

00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:03,792
Picard, you cheated?
I'm impressed.

341
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:05,875
It was a stupid mistake.

342
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,208
The Nausicaan didn't
take kindly to losing,

343
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,917
nor his friends.

344
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:14,583
They were outraged.
They wanted a fight.

345
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,542
I gave them one.

346
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:21,125
That's a beautiful story.

00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,458
MARTA:
So, he was cheating?

358
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,917
COREY: I'll bet you
that he had some sort

359
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,000
of magnetic
device in his belt.

360
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,959
It was controlling
the balls.

361
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,041
That's terrible.

362
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,458
We gotta get even.

363
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,959
What'd you have in mind?

364
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:32,750
Well, we can do to him
what he did to us-- cheat.

365
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,625
Only this time,
we rig the table

366
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,625
so his device will
backfire on him.

367
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,000
Corey, that won't
solve anything.

368
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,417
It'll teach him that
he can't go around

369
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,333
cheating
Starfleet officers.

370
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:47,834
All it'll do is provoke him.

371
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,542
And provoking a Nausicaan
is not a good idea.

372
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:53,000
I can handle him.
What if he's not alone?

373
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,583
What if he brings some of his
Nausicaan friends with him?

374
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,667
Well, then I guess that's
when I'm gonna have to depend

375
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:01,250
on<i> my</i> friends to
help me out.

376
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,375
Oh, Corey, there's got to be
a better way to handle this.

377
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,208
When did you start backing
away from a good fight?

378
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,083
Look, Corey, we're--
we're not cadets anymore.

379
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,250
We're officers.

380
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,750
We should start to set a
higher standard for ourselves.

381
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,125
It was a good idea,

382
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,333
but let's just
forget it, okay?

383
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,625
He'll get over it.

384
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,000
I hope so.

385
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:40,917
What?

386
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:43,166
Nothing.

387
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:47,542
I-it's just you'd usually
be the one plotting revenge.

388
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,250
Huh... yes...

389
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,625
that would be more in
character, wouldn't it?

390
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:56,250
Much, but I
always suspected

391
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,083
you had a hidden streak of
responsibility somewhere.

392
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,083
Perhaps it's just that
I'm getting older.

393
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,709
Maybe these bars
are just starting

394
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:06,667
to feel a little
heavy, Ensign.

395
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:11,375
Ensign Picard and
Ensign Batanides.

396
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,959
Sounds weird,
doesn't it?

397
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,083
It's gonna take some
getting used to.

398
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,333
It's too bad we can't
get used to it together.

399
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,583
Well... the three
of us, I mean.

400
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:28,291
Oh, of course.

401
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

402
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,458
Come.

403
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,500
Flowers.

404
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,959
Is there a "John-Luck
Pick-erd" here?

405
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,041
From one of your
conquests, no doubt.

406
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,875
I guess some things
aren't gonna change.

407
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,709
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

408
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,750
Did I interrupt
anything sordid, I hope?

409
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:05,291
No, Q, you did not.

410
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,875
Pity.

411
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,875
She's quite attractive.

412
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,208
We were friends, nothing more.

413
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,291
Is that another
regret I hear?

414
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,417
My, my...
We're simply riddled

415
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:18,333
with regrets about our
youth, now, aren't we?

416
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:21,709
My friendship with Marta is
not something that I regret.

417
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:23,208
But you wish
it had been more

418
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,083
than just a friendship,
now, don't you?

419
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,291
Well... maybe you
can change all that.

420
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:32,625
Q, what is it you want?

421
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,083
I thought you'd like to know

422
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:37,667
that Mr. Zweller's decided
not to take your advice.

423
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,875
He's in the Bonestell
Facility right now

424
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,917
rigging the table
to beat the Nausicaan.

425
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:45,542
I guess you weren't
that persuasive.

426
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,208
Corey...
Ow!

427
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,417
Johnny, don't sneak
up on me like that.

428
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:06,959
I thought you were
the gambling foreman.

429
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:09,250
I'm sorry.

430
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,500
I'm glad you're here.

431
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,583
Hand me that
magna-spanner, huh?

432
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,291
Corey, I'm not
here to help you.

433
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:18,709
I'm here to stop you from
making a serious mistake.

434
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,333
You sound like my mother.

435
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,000
Cheating the Nausicaans

436
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,333
could have serious
consequences for all of us.

437
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,125
It's a risk we can't
afford to take.

438
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,208
You<i> are</i> my mother.

439
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,917
Well, gee, Mom.

440
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,834
I guess I'll just have to
go tell those Nausicaans

441
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,375
I don't mind
if they cheat me.

442
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,250
This is not
a joke, Corey.

443
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,709
It better be.

444
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,709
Now, I'm gonna
finish my work here.

445
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:44,041
If you wanna
help me, fine.

446
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:46,041
If not, I'll see you
back at the starbase.

447
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,125
I said you're
not doing this.

448
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,834
Are you gonna
hit me, Johnny?

449
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,250
No.

450
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,000
But I'll tell the
gambling foreman

451
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,959
someone has been tampering
with his dom-jot table.

452
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,250
All right.

453
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,333
Have it your way,
Ensign Picard.

454
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,291
I just couldn't make
him understand.

455
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,250
At least he did
finally give it up.

456
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,750
Yes, but he didn't
take it very well.

457
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,417
(<i> chuckles</i> )
Oh, you know Corey.

458
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:32,291
He'll forget all about it
by tomorrow.

459
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,834
I hope you're right,

460
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:38,458
because he and I were friends
for years after this.

461
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:40,208
(<i> chuckles</i> )

462
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:44,208
I mean, um... I<i> hope</i>
that we will be.

463
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,667
You know...

464
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:54,375
you keep smiling at me.

465
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:58,542
Well, I've just never
seen you like this before.

466
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:02,291
You're so... serious.

467
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:07,166
Do I really seem
that different?

468
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,417
Maybe I'm just not
used to seeing you

469
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:13,458
in your officer's uniform.

470
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:19,333
No, it's-- it's more
than that.

471
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:22,166
You do seem different.

472
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,959
Well, I'm not-- I'm not
complaining or anything.

473
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,208
I think it suits you.

474
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,959
Really?

475
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,542
Yes.

476
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:36,834
It's very...
attractive.

477
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,917
Johnny...

478
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:46,625
haven't you ever
thought about us...

479
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:49,500
getting together?

480
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,667
Yes, I have, actually.

481
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:56,000
I've thought about it
for a long time.

482
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:00,625
Why didn't you
ever say so?

483
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:02,458
I don't know.

484
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:10,709
And at this moment,
I really have no idea why not.

485
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:19,166
You've said so now.

486
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:59,625
Morning, darling.

487
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Feeling a little
jumpy this morning?

488
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,041
Are we... guilty,
perhaps?

489
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:11,500
I don't feel guilty
about anything, Q.

490
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,709
No?

491
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:16,458
(<i> imitating Picard</i> )
"We're just friends, Q.

492
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:19,083
Nothing more."

493
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:21,208
And we're still friends.

494
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:26,625
(<i> sighs</i> )
So?

495
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,750
What's next?

496
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:33,083
I don't know.

497
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:41,125
What I do know is,
things will be different.

498
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:45,375
I'm sure.

499
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,375
(<i> quiet conversation</i> )

500
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,208
Good morning.

501
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,000
Johnny...

502
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,417
What's wrong?

503
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:22,333
Well, this is the
morning after, huh?

504
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,208
Look...

505
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,959
I don't regret anything
that happened last night.

506
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,917
I hope you don't
regret it either.

507
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,917
I don't-- I don't know.

508
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,208
We've been friends for
a long time, and...

509
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:44,291
and now...

510
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:49,250
I'm afraid we've ruined
that friendship.

511
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:57,208
Then perhaps we should...

512
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,792
forget about what
happened, and, uh...

513
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:02,875
and try to...

514
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:05,250
I wish I could.

515
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,625
It would make it much easier
to say good-bye tomorrow.

516
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,125
Um...

517
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:22,208
We're all supposed to,
um, get together later

518
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,041
for a last big night
out on the town

519
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,417
before we all
ship out.

520
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:26,959
I don't want
you to do anything

521
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,333
that would make you
uncomfortable.

522
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,709
We planned it.

523
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:36,333
I'll be there.

524
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:47,333
Q:
Well, let's see.

525
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:51,583
You've managed to get
slapped by one woman,

526
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,417
a drink thrown in
your face by another,

527
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,125
and alienate your
two best friends.

528
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,834
Doing pretty
well so far.

529
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:58,542
The only thing
left to avoid

530
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:01,166
is getting stabbed
through the heart.

531
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,083
(<i> loud crunching</i> )

532
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:07,333
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

533
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,208
MAN:
Good shot, good shot.

534
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,291
I think you'll like serving
on board the<i> Ajax.</i>

535
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:25,750
I hear that Captain Narth
is an excellent officer.

536
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:29,250
So I hear.

537
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:37,917
Well...

538
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:40,417
here's to the class of '27.

539
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,458
Play dom-jot, human?

540
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,333
Give you
a better chance.

541
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,625
Give you a bigger
stick, maybe.

542
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,208
I don't think
we're interested.

543
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:14,166
They are<i> undari--</i>
cowards.

544
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,583
(<i> Nausicaans laughing</i> )

545
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,125
What did you say?

546
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:23,083
Coward, like all Starfleet,
you talk and you talk.

547
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:25,208
But you have
no<i> guramba.</i>

548
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,959
Why don't we find out?
Hey, don't be a fool, Corey.

549
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:30,959
Look, there are plenty of other
people to play dom-jot with.

550
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:33,291
Now, just go about
your business.

551
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:35,750
Maybe I play with her.

552
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,166
Give her good time.

553
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,542
(<i> grunts</i> )

554
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,125
(<i> laughter</i> )

555
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:47,500
<i>Orcho lok resnik</i>
Starfleet.

556
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:57,792
I'm sorry, Corey.

557
00:32:57,792 --> 00:33:01,333
He was reaching
for a weapon.

558
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:05,000
I don't know who
you are anymore,

559
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,041
but you're not my friend.

560
00:33:13,417 --> 00:33:15,542
Good-bye, Johnny.

561
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,458
Congratulations,
<i>mon capitaine.</i>

562
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,041
You did it.

563
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:24,917
WORF:
Can I help you?

564
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,166
Can I help you,
Mr. Picard?

565
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,208
Mr. Worf...?

566
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,709
This is not for me.
You should take it

567
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:41,834
to Commander La Forge
in Engineering.

568
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,625
What's happened?

569
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,125
Is something wrong?

570
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:51,709
I'm not sure.

571
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:54,375
Mr. Worf, what is my
rank and position?

572
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,458
You are Lieutenant
junior grade

573
00:33:56,458 --> 00:34:00,000
assistant
astrophysics officer.

574
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,917
Are you feeling
all right?

575
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,333
Who is the captain
of this ship?

576
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:09,625
Captain Thomas Halloway.

577
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,709
Perhaps I should
escort you to Sick Bay.

578
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:15,291
No, I can find
my own way there.

579
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:17,291
Thank you, Commander.

580
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,458
Beverly...

581
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,291
something has happened to me.
I'm not sure--

582
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,583
(<i> German accent</i> )
Well, well, well.

583
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:28,375
What seems to
be the trouble,

584
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,959
Lieutenant Picard?

585
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:31,166
Q, what have you done?

586
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,542
I've done exactly
as I promised.

587
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:35,542
I've returned
you to the present.

588
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:37,875
But this is not the
present I remember.

589
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,041
You said nothing
would change.

590
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:43,458
Nothing has changed,
Jean-Luc...

591
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,000
except for you.

592
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,625
But then again, that's what
you wanted, wasn't it?

593
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:49,208
To change the man
you were in your youth.

594
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,750
Well, you did it.

595
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,834
This is the man
you are today.

596
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:56,625
And you should be happy.

597
00:34:56,625 --> 00:35:00,083
You have a real heart
beating in your chest

598
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,750
and you get to live out the
rest of your life in safety

599
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,333
running tests,
making analyses

600
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:10,500
and carrying reports
to your superiors.

601
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,583
(<i> low conversation</i> )

602
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:35,333
Excuse me.
Am I interrupting?

603
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,834
No, not at all.
Have a seat.

604
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,000
Thank you.

605
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,583
I'd like to talk to you
for a moment about my future

606
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:42,792
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

607
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:44,750
Of course,
Lieutenant.

608
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,458
Jean-Luc, isn't it?

609
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,500
Maybe I should go.
No. Please, Counselor.

610
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,875
I would very much like
to hear your thoughts.

611
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,083
First of all--
and I would like you

612
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,834
to be absolutely
straightforward with me--

613
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:59,959
how would you evaluate me
as an officer?

614
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,250
Well, um...

615
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,166
your performance records
have always been good.

616
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:09,333
You're thorough,
dedicated...

617
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,583
Steady, reliable.

618
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:16,917
Punctual.

619
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:18,750
I see.

620
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:24,375
What would you say
if I told you that I believed

621
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:28,083
that I was capable of
being very much more?

622
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:30,875
Perhaps we should discuss
this at your next evaluation.

623
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:34,000
I would appreciate it if
we could discuss it now.

624
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,667
You see, I feel that I
would like to move beyond

625
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:42,166
astrophysics,
to Engineering or...

626
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,500
or security.

627
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,959
Something that might
even lead to command.

628
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:49,333
Frankly, Lieutenant...

629
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,375
I don't think
that's realistic.

630
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,959
Why?

631
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:54,333
I really don't think

632
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,750
this is the place to
be discussing this--

633
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,333
Please, this is very
important to me.

634
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,625
I believe that
I can do more.

635
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,709
Hasn't that been
the problem all along?

636
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:07,917
Throughout your career
you've had lofty goals,

637
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:10,458
but... you've never
been willing to do

638
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:12,875
what's necessary
to attain them.

639
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,875
Would that be your evaluation
as well, Commander?

640
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:19,709
I think I have to agree
with the Counselor.

641
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:22,125
If you wanna get ahead,
you have to take chances,

642
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:26,500
stand out in a crowd,
get noticed.

643
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,792
I see.

644
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,750
Now, we don't
wanna lose you.

645
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,000
You're a very good officer.

646
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,250
Just not one
who stands out.

647
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,542
Why don't I talk to
Commander La Forge

648
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:38,166
in Engineering
and see what we can do.

649
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,750
But, command?

650
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,667
Well...

651
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:44,041
we'll see.

652
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,583
DATA:
Senior officers, please report

653
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:46,959
to the captain's ready room.

654
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:48,709
Acknowledged.

655
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:51,250
We should talk
about this later.

656
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:01,417
All right, Q,
that's enough.

657
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,208
You've made your point.

658
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,834
Q?

659
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,542
La Forge to Lieutenant Picard.

660
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:11,750
I'm still waiting for
that statistical analysis.

661
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,542
I'm on my way, sir.

662
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:23,417
Main Engineering.

663
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:30,792
You having a good laugh now, Q?

664
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:34,083
Does it amuse you to think of me
living out the rest of my life

665
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:37,583
as a dreary man
in a tedious job?

666
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:44,291
I gave you something most
mortals never experience--

667
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:46,333
a second chance at life.

668
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:49,667
And now, all you
can do is complain?

669
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:52,667
I can't live out
my days as that person.

670
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:56,875
That man is bereft
of passion...

671
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,166
and imagination!

672
00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,750
That is not who I am!

673
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,542
<i>Au contraire.</i>

674
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,333
He's the person
you wanted to be--

675
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:07,417
one who was less arrogant and
undisciplined in his youth.

676
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:10,875
One who was less like<i> me.</i>

677
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:13,041
The Jean-Luc Picard
you wanted to be--

678
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:15,417
the one who did not
fight the Nausicaan--

679
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:18,542
had quite a different career
from the one you remember.

680
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:21,500
That Picard never had
a brush with death,

681
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,041
never came face-to-face
with his own mortality,

682
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:26,417
never realized how
fragile life is

683
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:29,166
or how important
each moment must be.

684
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,333
So, his life never
came into focus.

685
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,417
He drifted through
much of his career

686
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:36,667
with no plan or agenda,

687
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,709
going from one assignment
to the next,

688
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:41,709
never seizing
the opportunities

689
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:43,792
that presented
themselves.

690
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:45,500
He never led
the away team

691
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,875
on Milika III to save
the ambassador,

692
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:51,208
or take charge of
the<i> Stargazer's</i> Bridge

693
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:53,000
when its captain
was killed.

694
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,792
And no one ever
offered him a command.

695
00:39:56,792 --> 00:40:02,000
He learned to
play it safe...

696
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,834
and he never, ever got
noticed by anyone.

697
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:13,792
You're right, Q.

698
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:15,667
You gave me
the chance to change

699
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,291
and I took the
opportunity.

700
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:20,250
But I admit now,
it was a mistake.

701
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:26,709
Are you asking me
for something, Jean-Luc?

702
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,834
Give me a chance
to put things back

703
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:30,208
the way they were before.

704
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,166
Before you died
in Sick Bay.

705
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:33,542
Is that what you want?

706
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:36,250
I would rather die
as the man I was

707
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,709
than live the life I just saw.

708
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:46,000
Coward,
like all Starfleet.

709
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,291
You talk and you talk,
but you have no<i> guramba.</i>

710
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,834
(<i> people laughing</i> )

711
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,250
What did you say?

712
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,542
I said...

713
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:58,625
you are a coward.

714
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,083
That's what I
thought you said.

715
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,917
(<i> grunting</i> )

716
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,500
(<i> yelling</i> )

717
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,792
(<i> groaning</i> )

718
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:46,125
(<i> laughing</i> )

719
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:54,542
His vital signs
are stable.

720
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,917
Captain?

721
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,750
Jean-Luc.

722
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:08,875
You were injured...

723
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:12,375
but I think you're
going to be all right.

724
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:16,250
(<i> chuckling</i> )

725
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:20,083
(<i> chuckling continues</i> )

726
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,083
I still don't know
what to make of it.

727
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:36,959
Was it a dream?

728
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:40,333
Or was it one of Q's
elaborate tricks?

729
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:42,125
A lot of people
who are near death

730
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:44,083
have strange experiences,

731
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:46,750
but I have never heard
one so detailed.

732
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,667
And, you know, there's still
part of me that cannot accept

733
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:53,375
that Q would give
me a second chance,

734
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:56,166
or that he would demonstrate
so much compassion.

735
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:58,417
And if it<i> was</i> Q...

736
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,500
I owe him a debt
of gratitude.

737
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,709
In what sense?

738
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:05,625
It sounds like he
put you through hell.

739
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,458
There are many
parts of my youth

740
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:10,000
that I'm not proud of.

741
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,250
There were...
loose threads...

742
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,834
untidy parts of me that
I would like to remove.

743
00:43:17,834 --> 00:43:22,542
But when I pulled on
one of those threads,

744
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:25,750
it unraveled the
tapestry of my life.

745
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:30,667
I was just trying to imagine

746
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:34,000
a hell-bent-for-leather
young officer

747
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,250
insulting a Nausicaan
twice his size.

748
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,000
I wish I had a chance to
know that Jean-Luc Picard.

749
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,625
Oh, well,
to tell the truth,

750
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,208
that wasn't the first
run-in that I had

751
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,834
with a couple of
surly Nausicaans.

752
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:46,959
Really?

753
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:49,083
Oh, yes.

754
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,917
During my sophomore year,

755
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:54,125
I was assigned to
training on Morikin VII.

756
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,917
Well, there was a
Nausicaan outpost

757
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:57,333
on one of the
outlying asteroids.

758
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:59,583
And one day...
