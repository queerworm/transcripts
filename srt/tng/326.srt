<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43989.1.</i>

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,834
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has arrived</i>
<i>at Jouret IV</i>

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,750
<i>in response</i>
<i>to a distress signal</i>

4
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:12,875
<i>from one of the Federation's</i>
<i>outermost colonies.</i>

5
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:17,875
Anything from the surface?

6
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,959
No, sir. There have
been no communications

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,709
from the colony
for over 12 hours.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,166
Sensors picking up
any signs of life?

9
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,375
None.

10
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:25,417
The surface environment

11
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,542
is safe for transport,
Commander.

12
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:47,917
Mr. O'Brien.

13
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:50,041
Verify these are
accurate coordinates

14
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,000
for the New Providence colony.

15
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,333
Coordinates verified, sir.

16
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,625
You're at the center of town.

17
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:50,458
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

18
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,667
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

19
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:56,583
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

20
00:01:56,625 --> 00:02:00,250
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

21
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:04,500
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

22
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:09,375
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

23
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:11,583
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43992.6.</i>

24
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,917
<i>Admiral Hanson and Lieutenant</i>
<i>Commander Shelby</i>

25
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,375
<i>of Starfleet Tactical</i>

26
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:16,834
<i>have arrived to review</i>
<i>the disappearance</i>

27
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,291
<i>of New Providence colony.</i>

28
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,792
<i>No sign remains</i>
<i>of the 900 inhabitants.</i>

29
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,000
The truth is...

30
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,458
hell, we are not ready.

31
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,667
We've known they were coming
for over a year.

32
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,792
We've thrown every resource we
have into this, but still...

33
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:33,083
RIKER:
Then you're
convinced

34
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,125
it is the Borg.

35
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,000
That's what I'm here
to find out.

36
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,500
The initial descriptions
of the surface conditions

37
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:41,375
are almost identical
to your report from System J-25.

38
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:42,917
Commander Riker
wrote those reports.

39
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,000
He agrees with you.

40
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,375
Commander Shelby

41
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:49,250
took over Borg tactical analysis
six months ago.

42
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,333
I've learned to give her
a wide latitude

43
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,458
when I want
to get things done.

44
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,458
That's how I intend
to operate here.

45
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,333
My priority has been
to develop some kind--

46
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,208
any kind--
of defense strategy.

47
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,750
Obviously, nothing we have now
can stop them.

48
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:05,417
We've been designing new weapons

49
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,500
but they're all
still on the drawing board.

50
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,750
We expected much more lead time.

51
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,667
Your encounter with the Borg

52
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,959
was over 7,000
light years away.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,375
If this<i> is</i> the Borg

54
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:16,667
it would indicate they have

55
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,250
a source of power
far superior to our own.

56
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,542
I'd like to see the colony site
as soon as possible, Captain.

57
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,959
It'll be dark there
in 30 minutes.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,375
We've scheduled an away team
for dawn.

59
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:25,667
Number One,
why don't you

60
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,583
show the Commander
to her quarters.

61
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,375
It's our poker night,
Admiral.

62
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:35,083
There's always
an open seat for you.

63
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,083
Another time, Commander.

64
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,250
Your Captain and I
have a lot to cover.

65
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,000
But, uh, rumor has it

66
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:44,417
Commander Shelby has
played a hand or two.

67
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,709
Keep your eye on her, Jean-Luc.

68
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,125
She's one very impressive
young lady.

69
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,625
You seem rather taken
with her, J.P.

70
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,375
Just an old man's fantasies.

71
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,041
When Shelby came into Tactical,
every admiral's uncle

72
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,959
had a take
on this Borg business.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,875
She cut through it.

74
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:11,709
She put us on track.

75
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,000
Earl Grey?

76
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,500
Please.

77
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:19,625
She'd make you one hell
of a First Officer.

78
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:22,333
Already have a hell
of a First Officer.

79
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,417
Don't tell me he's going
to pass up another commission.

80
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,583
One's available?

81
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,959
The<i> Melbourne.</i>

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,291
It's his if he wants it.

83
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,500
Hasn't he told you?

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,417
He'll make a fine captain, J.P.

85
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,667
You may want to tell<i> him</i> that.

86
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:43,041
We're still waiting
on his decision.

87
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,291
This is the third time

88
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,375
we've pulled out
the Captain's chair for Riker.

89
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:51,417
He just won't sit down.

90
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,542
Well, let me tell you something,
Jean-Luc--

91
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,542
there are a lot
of young hotshots like Shelby

92
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,959
on the way up.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,375
Riker could suddenly look

94
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:02,291
like he's standing still
next to them.

95
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,875
He's hurting his career
by staying put.

96
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:07,166
And if I were you,
I'd kick him in the rear end

97
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,417
for his own good.

98
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,750
I don't know exactly
what I'm looking for

99
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,208
but we've tested
the sections of the
<i>Enterprise's</i> hull

100
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,792
that were damaged
by the Borg.

101
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:25,417
There were some unusual
magnetic-resonance traces.

102
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,333
A Borg footprint?

103
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,041
That's my theory.

104
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,041
I'll see if it holds up
tomorrow.

105
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,083
I've reviewed your personnel.

106
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,625
I'll be assigning Mr. La Forge

107
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:36,375
and Mr. Data
to accompany me
on the away team.

108
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:39,792
I've already assigned them
to the away team.

109
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,375
And I'll be with you as well,
Commander.

110
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,875
Of course.

111
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,583
I appreciate any assistance
you can offer.

112
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,875
Tell me, Commander.

113
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,709
Is serving aboard the<i> Enterprise</i>

114
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,000
as extraordinary an experience
as I've heard?

115
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,875
Every bit.

116
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:58,875
Good, because I intend
to convince Captain Picard

117
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:00,834
that I'm the right choice
for the job.

118
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,917
Job? Which job?

119
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,875
Yours, of course.

120
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,333
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,625
I heard that you were leaving.

122
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:16,709
If I were, I'm sure
you'd be the first to know.

123
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:24,583
Poker's at 1700 hours
in my quarters, deck eight.

124
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,667
Got another king
in the hole, eh, Data?

125
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,208
I am afraid I cannot
answer that, Wesley

126
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,000
and as you are a
newcomer to the game

127
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,750
may I say, it is
inappropriate
for you to ask.

128
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,458
(<i> players chuckle</i> )

129
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,667
I will buy
another card, Counselor.

130
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,291
No help there.

131
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,291
Fold. Again.

132
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,667
Three jacks looking back
for the handsome young ensign.

133
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:53,792
Pair of deuces stands.

134
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:57,417
Flush, possible
straight flush.

135
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,959
Hmm.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,083
Your bet, Mr. Crusher.

137
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,250
I'm in for ten.

138
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,959
Call.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,166
Now it's time
for the long pants.

140
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,000
There's your ten. 100.

141
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,667
He's got the straight
flush, folks.

142
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,333
Not necessarily.

143
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,542
Commander Riker
may be bluffing, Wesley.

144
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,667
I don't think so.
Fold.

145
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:27,750
With three jacks?
What, are you kidding?

146
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:29,458
Wesley, you may get
straight A's in school

147
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,000
but there's a lot you
need to learn about poker.

148
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,291
Well, I've only got two pair

149
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,333
but I've got to see
your hole card.

150
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,709
I'll call.

151
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:49,875
(<i> Geordi chuckles</i> )

152
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,291
You got him.

153
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,709
Mr. Data and our guest
appear to be tardy.

154
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,834
Sir, Commander Shelby
and Data beamed down

155
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,625
to the planet's
surface an hour ago.

156
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,333
On whose authority?

157
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,417
On hers, sir.

158
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:39,959
Morning.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,834
Early bird gets
the worm, eh?

160
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,375
We've had some
interesting results.

161
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,709
Commander Shelby...

162
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,041
Walk with me, Commander.

163
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,959
Early bird?

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,583
I believe
Commander Shelby erred.

165
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,458
There is no evidence
of avifaunal

166
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,875
or crawling vermicular
life-forms on Jouret IV.

167
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,291
That's not what
she meant, Data

168
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,834
but you're right--
she erred.

169
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,166
I'm sorry,
but I woke up early

170
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,208
and I saw that a weather
system was moving in.

171
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,834
It could have affected
the soil readings.

172
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,166
So without any regard

173
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,750
for the risk of coming
down here alone...

174
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,291
Really, Commander,
if we ran into the Borg here

175
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,250
two extra bodies wouldn't have
made a hell of a difference

176
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,583
now, would they?

177
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,583
We had three hours
before the storm front hit

178
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,959
less than two hours now.

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,291
Data was available.

180
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,583
I took him.
We came.

181
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,125
I don't see your problem.

182
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,667
My problem, Commander, is
I expect to be notified

183
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,625
before there's a
change in my orders.

184
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,458
Noted for future reference.

185
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,625
Do you wish to hear
my report, sir?

186
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,583
Go ahead.

187
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,750
The soil contains the same
magnetic-resonance traces.

188
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,625
That's our footprint.

189
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,333
There's no doubt anymore.

190
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,417
It is the Borg.

191
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43993.5.</i>

192
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,250
<i>With confirmation of the Borg's</i>
presence in Federation space

193
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,834
<i>Admiral Hanson has returned</i>
<i>to Starbase 324</i>

194
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,417
<i>to discuss strategy</i>
<i>with Starfleet Command.</i>

195
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,834
<i>Lieutenant Commander Shelby</i>
<i>remains onboard</i>

196
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,834
<i>to continue</i>
<i>tactical preparations.</i>

197
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,166
I've also ordered
a standing Yellow Alert.

198
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,417
All Federation-allied outposts
have been warned.

199
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,250
Ops will continue to monitor
long-range sensors.

200
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,083
I've assigned Data,
La Forge and Mr. Crusher

201
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,291
to work
with Commander Shelby.

202
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,333
Good.

203
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,250
You've covered all the bases.

204
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,500
What's your impression
of Shelby?

205
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,125
She knows her stuff.

206
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,375
She has your
full confidence?

207
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,917
Well, I think she
needs supervision.

208
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,125
She takes the initiative
a little too easily--

209
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,083
sometimes with risks.

210
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,667
(<i> tsking</i> )

211
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,750
Sounds like a young
Lieutenant Commander

212
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,291
I recruited
as a First Officer.

213
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,917
Perhaps.

214
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,166
Will...

215
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:03,166
what the hell are you
still doing here?

216
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,500
Sir?

217
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:07,083
You've been offered
the<i> Melbourne.</i>

218
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,959
I've decided not to pursue
that commission at this time.

219
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,375
She's a fine ship, Will.

220
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:15,417
Yes, but she's not the
<i>Enterprise.</i>

221
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:20,250
With all due respect, sir,
you need me, particularly now.

222
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:25,166
Indeed. Starfleet needs
good Captains, particularly now.

223
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,917
Reconsider your decision.

224
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,166
Are you telling me to leave,
Captain?

225
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:34,917
I'm asking you to look
at your career objectively.

226
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,917
Will, you're ready
to work without a net.

227
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,500
You're ready
to take command

228
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:46,208
and, you know,<i> Enterprise</i>

229
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,500
will go along
just fine without you.

230
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,625
What am I still doing here?

231
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,792
Deanna, I pushed myself
hard to get this far.

232
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:57,792
I... I sacrificed a lot.

233
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,333
I always said I wanted
my own command

234
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,125
and yet... something's
holding me back.

235
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,083
Is it wrong for me
to want to stay?

236
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,667
What do you think?

237
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,375
(<i> sighs</i> )

238
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,250
Maybe I'm just afraid
of the big chair.

239
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,959
I don't think so.

240
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,166
The Captain says

241
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,542
Shelby reminds him
of the way that I used to be

242
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,959
and he's right.

243
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,625
She comes in here
full of drive and ambition.

244
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,000
Impatient, taking risks.

245
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,333
I look at her and I wonder what
happened to those things in me.

246
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,458
I liked those things about me.

247
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,250
I've lost something.

248
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:39,959
You mean, you're older,
more experienced

249
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,458
a little more... seasoned.

250
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,959
"Seasoned."

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,500
That's a horrible
thing to say to a man.

252
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,834
I don't think
you've lost a thing.

253
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,250
And I think you've gained
more than you realize.

254
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,208
You're much more
comfortable with yourself

255
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,458
than you used to be.

256
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,458
Maybe that's the problem--

257
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,375
I'm too comfortable here.

258
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:04,542
I'm not sure
I know what that means.

259
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,709
You're happy here

260
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,959
happier than I've
ever known you to be.

261
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,333
So... it comes down
to a simple question.

262
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,125
What do you want, Will Riker?

263
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:23,458
SHELBY:
...a manipulation effect in the
Borg ship's subspace field.

264
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,875
A definite pattern
at 4.8 minute intervals

265
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,875
during your first
confrontation with them.

266
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:31,500
It might indicate
high-output auxiliary
generators kicking in.

267
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,875
One theory is that their
systems are decentralized

268
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:36,625
with redundant power sources
located throughout the ship.

269
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,875
That is a reasonable conclusion.

270
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:41,625
Borg technology has given
each member of their society

271
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,125
the ability to interface

272
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,667
and function
collectively.

273
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,625
It is likely they
have constructed their ship

274
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,041
with the same philosophy.

275
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,542
You knock out one generator

276
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,709
and another one takes over
without interruption.

277
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,291
What kind of damage would we
have to do to shut them down?

278
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,917
Projections suggest
that a Borg ship like this one

279
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,166
could continue
to function effectively

280
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,917
even if 78% of it
was inoperable.

281
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:01,959
And our best shot

282
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,500
barely scratched
the surface.

283
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,375
Well, from what I've seen

284
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,542
I can't believe that any
of these new weapon systems

285
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,083
can be ready in less
than 18 months, Commander.

286
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,291
We've been projecting 24.

287
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,583
Is there anything we can do here

288
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,667
to adapt
our current defense systems?

289
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:20,792
We'll have to go through
the specs again, but...

290
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:22,083
I don't know.

291
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,959
My mind's turned to clay.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,709
Mine, too.

293
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,959
I think we should look

294
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,667
at modifying
the plasma phaser design.

295
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,792
Commander, I think
we should call it a night.

296
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:32,792
That's an order.

297
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:34,333
We'll reconvene at 0500.

298
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,583
Sir, if I may be allowed
to continue with Mr. Data

299
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,083
who does not require rest.

300
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,959
<i>You</i> need rest, Commander.

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,583
If we have a confrontation
with the Borg

302
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,250
without improving
our defense systems...

303
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,959
If we have a confrontation

304
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,583
I don't want a crew
fighting the Borg

305
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,083
at the same time they're
fighting their own fatigue.

306
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,583
Dismissed.

307
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,083
At 1900 hours yesterday

308
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,250
the USS<i> Lalo</i>
departed Zeta Alpha II

309
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,291
on a freight run
to Sentinel Minor IV.

310
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,083
At 2200 hours and 12 minutes

311
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:20,959
a distress signal was received
at Starbase 157.

312
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,542
The<i> Lalo</i> reported contact
with an alien vessel

313
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,125
described as cube-shaped.

314
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,250
The distress signal
ended abruptly

315
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,291
and she has not been
heard from since.

316
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,291
Mr. Data, how long would it take
to get there at warp nine?

317
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,917
One hour,
17 minutes, sir.

318
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,500
Make it so.

319
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,000
We're coming
with every available starship

320
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,333
to assist, Captain

321
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,709
but the closest help
is six days away.

322
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,083
We'll try and keep them
occupied until you arrive.

323
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,458
I know you will.

324
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,041
Hanson out.

325
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,750
All hands stand
to battle stations.

326
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,166
Commander Shelby

327
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,458
what is the status
of our defense preparations?

328
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,375
Mr. La Forge has a plan
to modulate shield nutation.

329
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:03,917
Hopefully, that'll
hold them off
for a while.

330
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,709
LA FORGE:
At the same
time, we'll be

331
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,000
retuning phasers to higher
EM base emitting frequencies

332
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,959
try to disrupt
their subspace field.

333
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,458
What's your assessment
of our potential effectiveness?

334
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,625
(<i> sighs</i> ):
It's a shot in the dark, Captain

335
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,500
but, for now,
it's the best we can do.

336
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:20,125
Dismissed.

337
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,041
(<i> console beeping</i> )

338
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,750
Sir, reading
unidentified vessel

339
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:48,583
just entering
sensor range

340
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,375
bearing 210
mark 151.

341
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:54,250
Hail them, Mr. Worf.

342
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,291
No response, sir.

343
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,625
Move to intercept.

344
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,333
WESLEY:
Aye, sir.

345
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,291
Sir, the vessel
has already changed course

346
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,834
to intercept us.

347
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,208
Approaching
at warp 9.3.

348
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,709
Entering visual range.

349
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,417
On screen.

350
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,041
Magnify.

351
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,625
Mr. Worf, dispatch
a subspace message

352
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,917
to Admiral Hanson.

353
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:30,041
We have engaged the Borg.

354
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,792
WORF:
Captain,<i> you</i>
are being hailed.

355
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,500
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )
I am?

356
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:51,417
Yes, Captain--
by name.

357
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:55,375
Data, is it the same ship
we faced at J-25?

358
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,917
Uncertain,
Commander.

359
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:00,875
But the dimensions
are precisely the same.

360
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:03,667
On screen.

361
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,625
I am Captain Jean-Luc...

362
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,917
BORG VOICES:
...Jean-Luc Picard, Captain
of the Starship<i> Enterprise</i>

363
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:12,375
registry NCC-1701-D.

364
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,333
You will lower your shields
and prepare

365
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,166
to transport yourself
aboard our vessel.

366
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,709
If you do not cooperate,
we will destroy your ship.

367
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,375
You have committed acts
of aggression

368
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:23,250
against the United Federation
of Planets.

369
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,041
If you do not withdraw
immediately...

370
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,667
You will surrender yourself

371
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,125
or we will destroy your ship.

372
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,750
Your defensive capabilities

373
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,917
are unable to withstand...

374
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:34,000
What the hell
do they want with you?

375
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,291
I thought they weren't
interested in human life-forms--

376
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,750
only our technology.

377
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,750
Their priorities seem
to have changed.

378
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:40,917
Open.

379
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,500
WORF:
Channel open.

380
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:45,250
We have developed new
defense capabilities

381
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,166
since our last meeting,
and we are prepared to use them

382
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,250
if you do not withdraw
from Federation space.

383
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,542
LA FORGE:
Captain

384
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,458
shields are being probed.

385
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,291
I'm modulating nutation.

386
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,583
Captain, the Borg are
attempting to lock onto us
with their tractor beam.

387
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,125
Load torpedo bays.
Arm phasers.

388
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,583
Lock coordinates on the source
of the tractor beam.

389
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,125
Shield status.

390
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,000
Holding, sir.

391
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,250
The nutation modulation
has them confused.

392
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,291
They have the ability
to analyze and adapt, Commander.

393
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,709
Shield modulation has failed.

394
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,208
They've locked on.

395
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,208
Shields are being drained.

396
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,834
90%... 80...

397
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,208
Trying to recalibrate nutation.

398
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,208
Damn!

399
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,542
Shields
have failed.

400
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,125
Fire all weapons.

401
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,375
Their subspace field is intact.

402
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,917
New phaser frequencies
had no impact.

403
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,166
Reverse engines.

404
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,125
LA FORGE:
Full reverse.

405
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:56,250
We're not moving.

406
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,291
Fire at will.

407
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,834
Launching
torpedoes.

408
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,750
Phaser spread
continuing.

409
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,083
Still no damage to
the Borg vessel, sir.

410
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,917
COMPUTER:

411
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,500
They are cutting

413
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,917
Geordi, evacuate

414
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:19,083
Computer, evacuation sequence.

415
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,750
Sealing doors to core chamber.
Come on now.

416
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,125
Let's move it, people!
Let's move it. Let's go!

417
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,583

419
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:28,458
Sealing Main Engineering.

420
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,458
Data, fluctuate phaser
resonance frequencies.

421
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,041
Random settings,
keep them changing.

422
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,208
Don't give them time
to adapt.

423
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:44,500
The tractor beam
has been released.

424
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:45,583
Warp nine.

425
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:49,917
Course 151 mark 330.

426
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,792
Engage.

427
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,583
They are in pursuit,
Captain.

428
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,250
Maintain course.

429
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,917
Damage report, Geordi.

430
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:10,000
Hull rupture
in Main Engineering.

431
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:13,083
The damage is pretty
heavy. We lost a lot of
good people down there.

432
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,083
11 dead, eight more
unaccounted for, Captain.

433
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,834
Repair teams to Engineering.
Seal hull breach.

434
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,000
They didn't get to the core.

435
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,250
I can control functions
from here.

436
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,709
Now approaching
the Paulson Nebula, sir.

437
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,583
Drop to impulse.

438
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,875
Take us in, Ensign.

439
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,000
The field's getting
too dense, sir.

440
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,792
Steady.

441
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,625
Analysis of the nebula cloud,
Mr. Data.

442
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:57,625
82% dilithium
hydroxyls...

443
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,959
magnesium, chromium.

444
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,583
Should provide
an effective screen

445
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,875
against their
sensors, Captain.

446
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,208
Mr. La Forge,
prepare to reverse engines.

447
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,709
Full stop.

448
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,667
(<i> console beeps</i> )

449
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:22,083
The Borg ship
is continuing scans

450
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,709
attempting to locate us.

451
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,959
Good.

452
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,041
As long as they're
looking for us

453
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,583
they won't hurt anyone else.

454
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,375
Time index: 514.

455
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:39,417
Data started to fluctuate
phaser resonance frequencies.

456
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,166
The Borg's beam breaks contact.

457
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:45,333
Slow playback.
Take a closer look,
Commander. Mr. La Forge?

458
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,917
LA FORGE:
There's a two percent drop
in power for an instant

459
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,125
but it is system-wide.

460
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,375
The phaser frequency spread
was in a high narrow band.

461
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:54,834
Conceivably, the ship's
power distribution nodes

462
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,667
are vulnerable
to those frequencies.

463
00:23:56,709 --> 00:23:58,917
If we can generate
a concentrated burst of power

464
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,000
at that same
frequency distribution--

465
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,917
I mean a lot more than anything
our phasers

466
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,625
or photon torpedoes
could ever provide...

467
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:05,709
How do we do that?

468
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,041
The main deflector dish.

469
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,041
It's the only component
on the<i> Enterprise</i>

470
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,542
designed to channel
that much power at
controlled frequencies.

471
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,250
End program.

472
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,959
Unfortunately, there
is one slight detail.

473
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,291
In the process, the blast

474
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:20,083
completely destroys the
<i>Enterprise</i> as well.

475
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,750
If we could get further away,
increase the deflector's range.

476
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,959
SHELBY:
It could work.

477
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
In the meantime, we should
retune all phasers

478
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,166
including the hand units,
to the same frequency.

479
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,709
Proceed.

480
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,834
I'll inform the Captain.

481
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,000
There is one other
recommendation

482
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,500
I'd like to make, Commander.

483
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:35,834
Separate the saucer section.

484
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,291
Assign a skeleton crew
to create a diversion.

485
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,792
We may need the power from
the saucer's impulse engines.

486
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:43,125
But it would give them more
than one target to worry about.

487
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,625
It's too great a risk.

488
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,208
I'd like the Captain
to make that decision, sir.

489
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,750
Commander,
I bring all the alternatives

490
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,291
to the Captain's attention.

491
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,917
That will be all.

492
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,125
I going to need to
install higher capacity
power transfers

493
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,667
to the deflector
dish, Commander.
How long?

494
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:07,458
Better part
of a day.

495
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,166
She gets a full head
of steam, doesn't she?

496
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,375
Mm-hmm. She's a formidable
presence, to say the least

497
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:13,625
but I'm convinced she can
help us here, Commander.

498
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:14,709
I am, too.

499
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,834
Don't worry about it.

500
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,500
I can handle Shelby.

501
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,291
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come.

502
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:29,166
Come in, Number One.

503
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:30,792
Commander Shelby
was just telling me

504
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:35,417
of your... concerns
about her plan.

505
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:36,834
I'm sorry if she
troubled you, sir.

506
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,583
I have already
informed her...

507
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,208
PICARD:
Yes, I entirely agree
with you, Number One.

508
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,667
It's not the time.

509
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,709
But the time may come

510
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,834
when we will be required
to take greater risks.

511
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:52,375
I want you to consider her plan
as a fall-back position.

512
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,166
Make the necessary preparations.

513
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:56,291
Very good, sir.

514
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:07,375
Deck eight,
Battle Bridge.

515
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:08,875
Halt.

516
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:12,583
Commander, you and I need
to have a conversation.

517
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:15,667
You never ordered me not to
discuss this with the Captain.

518
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:17,667
You disagree with me--
fine.

519
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,041
You need to take it
to the Captain-- fine.

520
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,333
Through me.

521
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:24,166
You do an end run
around me again

522
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,667
I'll snap you back so hard

523
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,625
you'll think you're
a first-year cadet again.

524
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:29,959
May I speak frankly, sir?

525
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,792
By all means.

526
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:33,667
You're in my way.

527
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:36,583
Really.

528
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,667
How terrible for you.

529
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:40,875
All you know how to do
is play it safe.

530
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:43,000
I suppose that's why
someone like you

531
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,583
sits in the shadow
of a great man

532
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:45,709
for as long as you have

533
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,959
passing up one command
after another.

534
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,667
Proceed to deck eight.

535
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,417
When it comes to this
ship and this crew

536
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,625
you're damned right
I play it safe.

537
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:59,583
If you can't make
the big decisions, Commander

538
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:02,542
I suggest you make room
for someone who can.

539
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,625
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43996.2.</i>

540
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:20,834
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> remains</i>
<i>concealed in the dust cloud.</i>

541
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:24,125
<i>And, to my surprise, the Borg</i>
<i>have maintained their position</i>

542
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,917
<i>waiting for us</i>
<i>to come out of hiding.</i>

543
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,542
<i>I have no explanation</i>

544
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:30,333
<i>for their special interest</i>
<i>in me or this ship.</i>

545
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,375
<i>We continue to prepare</i>
<i>our defenses</i>

546
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,917
<i>for the inevitable</i>
<i>confrontation</i>

547
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:36,834
<i>but, I must admit,</i>
<i>on this night</i>

548
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:38,792
<i>I contemplate</i>
<i>the distinct possibility</i>

549
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:41,417
<i>that no defense may be adequate</i>
<i>against this enemy.</i>

550
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:42,875
Captain.

551
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,709
Trouble sleeping?

552
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,458
It's something of a tradition,
Guinan--

553
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,959
Captain touring the ship
before a battle.

554
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,667
Oh.

555
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:18,542
Before a<i> hopeless</i> battle

556
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:21,166
if I remember
the tradition correctly.

557
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,125
Not necessarily.

558
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,500
Nelson toured the HMS<i> Victory</i>
<i>before Trafalgar.</i>

559
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:29,834
Yes, but Nelson never returned
from Trafalgar, did he?

560
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,792
No, but the battle
was won.

561
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:37,750
Do you expect this
battle to be won?

562
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:41,250
We may yet prevail.

563
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:44,583
That's... a conceit.

564
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,875
But... it's a healthy one.

565
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:50,458
I wonder if
the Emperor Honorius

566
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,875
watching the Visigoths
coming over the seventh hill

567
00:28:53,917 --> 00:29:00,667
truly realized that the Roman
Empire was about to fall.

568
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:05,208
This is just another page
in history, isn't it?

569
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,875
Will this be the end
of<i> our</i> civilization?

570
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:11,375
Turn the page.

571
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,583
This isn't the end.

572
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:20,959
You say that
with remarkable assuredness.

573
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,166
With experience.

574
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:25,458
When the Borg destroyed
my world

575
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,291
my people were scattered
throughout the universe.

576
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,208
We survived.

577
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,166
As will humanity survive.

578
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,750
As long as there's
a handful of you

579
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:38,500
to keep
the spirit alive

580
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,625
you<i> will</i> prevail.

581
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:43,166
Even if it takes a millennium.

582
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,917
(<i> explosion</i> )

583
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:50,542
WORF:
Captain Picard,
report to the Bridge.

584
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:53,208
I'm on my way, Lieutenant.

585
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:14,709
They're some sort
of magnetometric-guided charges.

586
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,750
Status of shields?

587
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,709
WORF:
Back to 48%, Captain.

588
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,125
Mr. La Forge, I may have
to take us out of the nebula.

589
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,875
I want all the power
you can give me.

590
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:28,250
Engines are ready, Captain.

591
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,792
Recommend you adjust
shield harmonics

592
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:32,375
to favor the upper EM band
when you proceed.

593
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:34,208
Acknowledged.

594
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,166
Direct hit, deck nine.

595
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:38,583
Damage report.

596
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:40,875
Structural latching system
integrity breached.

597
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:42,500
Prepare to take us
out of here, Number One.

598
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:43,625
Fire up the engines.

599
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,125
Half impulse till we
clear the nebula

600
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,667
then punch it up
to warp nine.

601
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:48,959
Ready phasers, load
forward torpedo bays.

602
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,750
Engage.

603
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,041
Borg tractor beam
is attempting to lock on.

604
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,291
Fire at will.

605
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,834
Continue rotating
shield frequency.

606
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:03,959
(<i> console beeping</i> )

607
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,291
Shields failing.

608
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:07,959
(<i> insistent beeping</i> )

609
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,875
Tractor beam<i> has</i> locked on.

610
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:33,250
It's no use.
They've already adapted
to the new frequencies.

611
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,500
(<i> grunts</i> )

612
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:03,333
The Borg ship
is disengaging.

613
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:04,792
Leaving at
warp speed.

614
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:07,041
Maintain pursuit.

615
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:14,709
Borg vessel has reached
warp nine, 9.4, 9.6.

616
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,750
Stay with them.

617
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:17,125
Riker to O'Brien.

618
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,208
Can you get a fix
on the Captain?

619
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,375
Negative, sir.

620
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:20,667
There's some kind
of interference.

621
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:22,667
I can't lock in on his signal.

622
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:25,083
Senior officers,
report to the Bridge.

623
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,000
Sir, the coordinates
they have set--

624
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,417
they are on a
direct course

625
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:34,625
to Sector 001--
the Terran system.

626
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,709
Earth.

627
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:07,083
BORG VOICES:
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

628
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:09,709
you lead the strongest ship
of the Federation fleet.

629
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,834
You speak for your people.

630
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,917
I have nothing to say to you

631
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:17,750
and I will resist you
with my last ounce of strength.

632
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:19,166
Strength is irrelevant.

633
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,875
Resistance is futile.

634
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,875
We wish to improve ourselves.

635
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,667
We will add your biological

636
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:26,875
and technological
distinctiveness to our own.

637
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:30,375
Your culture will adapt
to service ours.

638
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:32,250
Impossible.

639
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:35,917
My culture is based on freedom
and self-determination.

640
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,709
Freedom is irrelevant.

641
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,750
Self-determination
is irrelevant.

642
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:41,667
You must comply.

643
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,834
We would rather die.

644
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:45,792
Death is irrelevant.

645
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:48,834
Your archaic cultures
are authority driven.

646
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:51,792
To facilitate our introduction
into your societies

647
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:54,917
it has been decided that a human
voice will speak for us

648
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,250
in all communications.

649
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:59,458
You have been chosen
to be that voice.

650
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,792
WORF:
Commander, they
are leading us

651
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:09,750
into the heart
of our own defenses.

652
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,208
Yeah, well, so far,
they haven't had

653
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,542
much of a reason
to worry about our defenses.

654
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:16,333
Commander, if the Borg
stay at warp 9.6

655
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,709
we'll be forced
to discontinue pursuit

656
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,417
and power down
in less than three hours.

657
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,166
Two hours,
40 minutes,
three seconds.

658
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,792
How long before
the deflector's ready?

659
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:24,875
We're close, a few hours maybe.

660
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:27,083
I know-- I'll get it done
in two somehow

661
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,750
but, Commander, I'm going
to need serious power

662
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:30,875
from the warp engines
to make this weapon work.

663
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:32,083
So far, we're using
everything we've got

664
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,500
just to keep up with them.

665
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:36,500
Sir, we've got to get that ship
down to impulse.

666
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:40,333
I'm leading an away team over
there to get the Captain back.

667
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:41,917
We'll find a way
to get them out of warp.

668
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:44,166
Ensign Crusher, you continue
to assist Mr. La Forge.

669
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,834
Commander Shelby,
you'll take the Bridge

670
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,000
and coordinate
with Starfleet.

671
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,959
Data, Worf, Doctor,
you're with me.

672
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,125
Excuse me, sir.

673
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,250
With my knowledge
of the Borg...

674
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:53,166
Those are my
orders, Commander!

675
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:55,041
TROI:
Commander Riker

676
00:34:55,083 --> 00:35:00,041
it is inappropriate for you
to lead the away team.

677
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,125
Until the return
of Captain Picard

678
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,333
you are in command
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

679
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:05,792
We're in
a state of war

680
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,291
and your place
is on the Bridge.

681
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,917
Commander Shelby

682
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:16,709
you'll lead
the away team.

683
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,083
Make it so.

684
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:33,542
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43998.5.</i>

685
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:35,000
<i>Our pursuit of the Borg</i>

686
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,542
<i>continues on a course</i>
<i>that will take us</i>

687
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:38,458
<i>to the very core</i>
<i>of the Federation.</i>

688
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,500
<i>The devastation they could</i>
<i>bring is beyond imagination.</i>

689
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:44,667
These phasers
have been retuned.

690
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,625
Each has a different frequency
spanning the upper EM band.

691
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,583
All right, a reminder--
we only get to use

692
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,250
each of these once,
maybe twice

693
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:52,875
before the Borg
learn to adapt.

694
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,917
Don't fire
until you have to.

695
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:57,041
What kind of resistance
should we expect?

696
00:35:57,083 --> 00:36:00,166
At our first encounter,
the Borg virtually ignored us

697
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,834
when we beamed aboard
their vessel.

698
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:04,375
Clearly, they did not consider
our being there a threat.

699
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:05,750
That may change, however

700
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:08,709
if we start interfering
with their plans.

701
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,125
Shelby to Bridge.

702
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:18,333
Away team ready.

703
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,750
We've got 58 minutes

704
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,625
before we have to power down
and disengage.

705
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:22,709
Understood.

706
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,792
Proceed. Commander?

707
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:26,583
No unnecessary risks.
Clear?

708
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:27,667
Very clear, sir.

709
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:29,291
Shelby out.

710
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:32,083
We've matched warp velocity
for transport, Commander.

711
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,625
Energize.

712
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,875
WORF:
Tricorder functions minimal.

713
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:53,542
Any signs of human life?

714
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:55,792
Inconclusive.

715
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,583
Look at this.

716
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,917
This is extraordinary.

717
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,125
Those appear to be

718
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:37,333
some kind of power
waveguide conduits

719
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,583
which allow them
to work collectively

720
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,417
as they perform
ship functions.

721
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,792
There's no way to take
out enough of these

722
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,041
to disable them.

723
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,291
What if we
look at this

724
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:48,834
from the mosquito's
point of view?

725
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,667
Interesting metaphor, Doctor.

726
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:52,208
What is your idea?

727
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,000
If we sting them
in a tender spot

728
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:58,792
they might stop for
a minute to scratch.

729
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,041
Distribution
nodes.

730
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:19,750
SHELBY:
If we take out a few of these,
it just might make them scratch.

731
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,667
The Captain's
communicator--

732
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:23,166
it is still activated.

733
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,375
Crusher to Picard.

734
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:25,583
Can you hear me?

735
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:29,375
Can you locate it, Worf?

736
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:31,041
This way.

737
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:37,792
I strongly recommend redeploying
all available defenses

738
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:39,291
to protect Sector 001, Admiral.

739
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:43,208
We're moving to intercept
at Wolf 359.

740
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,875
We'll make our stand there.

741
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:47,250
How much longer can you
maintain pursuit?

742
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,875
22 minutes if they stay
at their current speed.

743
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,750
If we can't bring them
out of warp

744
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:53,917
we'll do as much damage
as we can

745
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:56,375
before we have to disengage.

746
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,250
Picard?

747
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,458
Nothing yet, sir.

748
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:05,375
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

749
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:08,083
(<i> beeping faster</i> )

750
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:09,792
In here.

751
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:34,959
Shelby to<i> Enterprise.</i>

752
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,166
Go ahead.

753
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,417
We've found
the Captain's uniform

754
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,709
and his communicator.

755
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,291
We're resuming our search.

756
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,166
Stand by, Commander.

757
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:44,417
We're in business.

758
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,375
It'll burn out
the main deflector

759
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,083
but it'll be one
hell of a bang.

760
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,208
Radiation danger?

761
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,750
We're going to have
to evacuate

762
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,583
the entire forward half
of the secondary hull

763
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,000
and the lower three
decks of the saucer.

764
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,291
I'll see to that.

765
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:58,000
Commander Shelby

766
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:00,250
we have only 17 minutes
of warp power left.

767
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:03,083
Do whatever you can
to get them out of warp.

768
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,375
Acknowledged.

769
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:06,291
Shelby out.

770
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,500
Let's take out some
of these distribution nodes

771
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:15,667
and see what happens.

772
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,667
Sir, they've done it.

773
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:52,000
The Borg ship
is dropping out of warp.

774
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,125
Go to impulse.

775
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:55,375
Aye, sir.

776
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:57,709
Diverting warp power
to main deflector.

777
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,125
Move us to within
40,000 kilometers

778
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,500
and match velocity.

779
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,000
Commence arming sequence.

780
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:06,458
Increase deflector modulation
to upper frequency band.

781
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:30,000
Shelby to<i> Enterprise.</i>

782
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,208
Encountering resistance.

783
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,125
Prepare to beam us
back on my signal.

784
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:53,792
SHELBY:
They're adapting
to the frequencies.

785
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:58,875
Jean-Luc.

786
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:06,542
Captain!

787
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:08,375
(<i> gasps</i> )

788
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:18,667
(<i> grunts</i> )

789
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:20,375
<i>Enterprise,</i> get us out of here.

790
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,083
The Captain?

791
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,208
We were unable to
retrieve him, sir.

792
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,291
The Captain has been
altered by the Borg.

793
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:45,458
Altered?

794
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,000
He<i> is</i> a Borg.

795
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:51,458
We'll go back.
I need more people.

796
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,792
We need to retune
the phasers again.

797
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:54,166
We'll get him
out of there.

798
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,709
LA FORGE:
Commander.

799
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,000
Reading subspace field
fluctuations from within

800
00:42:58,041 --> 00:42:58,959
the Borg ship.

801
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,083
Looks like
they're...

802
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,834
regenerating-- restoring power.

803
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:04,208
They could be capable
of warp any minute.

804
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,166
Is the deflector ready?

805
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,083
It's ready.

806
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:11,291
Will, he's alive.
If we could get him
back to the ship

807
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:13,583
I might be able
to restore...
This is our only chance
to destroy them.

808
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,709
If they get back into warp,
our weapon is useless.

809
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,750
We'll sabotage them again
if we have to.

810
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:20,458
We can't maintain power.

811
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,583
We don't have the time.
Prepare to fire.

812
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,041
At least consult
with Starfleet Command.

813
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,834
Get Admiral Hanson
on subspace.

814
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:27,458
Belay that order, Lieutenant.

815
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,542
There's no time.

816
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:32,583
Sir, we are being hailed
by the Borg.

817
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,375
On screen.

818
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:56,625
I am Locutus of Borg.

819
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:00,083
Resistance is futile.

820
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:06,291
Your life, as it has been,
is over.

821
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,625
From this time forward,

822
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:13,375
you will service<i> us.</i>

823
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:28,000
Mr. Worf... fire.
