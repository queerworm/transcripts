PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41601.3.</i>

00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:08,000
<i>We are crossing through</i>
<i>the Zed Lapis sector</i>

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,542
<i>where we will rendezvous</i>
<i>with Shuttlecraft 13</i>

4
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:11,917
<i>carrying Deanna Troi</i>

5
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:13,375
<i>who is returning</i>
<i>from a conference.</i>

6
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:15,083
<i>Because engineering is involved</i>

7
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:17,625
<i>in preventive maintenance</i>
<i>on our dilithium crystals</i>

8
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:20,041
<i>we are presently traveling</i>
<i>on impulse power.</i>

9
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,542
Routine deep sensor probes
indicate no obstacles

10
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,667
or vessels within a range
of three light years.

11
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:26,792
Confirmed.

12
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,333
The martial arts competition
is in three days.

13
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,375
Are you prepared?

14
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:34,792
I will be if you'll meet me
on the holodeck later.

15
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,083
I need your help

16
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,083
with the Mishiama
wrist-lock and break.

17
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,083
If it works on you

18
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,250
I can use it
on anyone.

19
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,834
A valid assumption.

20
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,709
Who is your
first competitor?

21
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,000
Science Officer Swenson.

22
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,125
You will defeat him easily.

23
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,375
Well, I'm more concerned

24
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,834
with Lieutenant Minnerly's
kick-boxing.

25
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,458
You are favored
in the ship's pool.

26
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,333
You bet on me?

27
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,458
A sure thing.

28
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,959
LA FORGE:
Captain

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,250
estimated rendezvous
with the shuttle

30
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,333
in one hour and ten minutes.

31
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,417
Thank you,
Lieutenant.

32
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,208
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir.

33
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,834
It'll be good to have
Counselor Troi back,
won't it, Number One?

34
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,083
It certainly will.

35
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,750
WORF:
Sir!

36
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:28,500
I'm receiving an emergency
transmission from the shuttle.

37
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:30,667
PICARD:
On main viewer.

38
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:31,959
I can't, sir.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,500
We're receiving
audio only.

40
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:34,583
PICARD:
Open the frequency.

41
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,667
Aye, sir.

42
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,083
LIEUTENANT PRIETO:
What a jolt.

43
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,417
Position report?

44
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,417
Sir, I have an onboard
systems failure.

45
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:41,875
You'll have to tell me
where I am.

46
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:43,083
I read your coordinates

47
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,083
at three-seven-zero
point two-three-six.

48
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,458
Confirm.

49
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,458
PRIETO:
I can't confirm.

50
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,125
My instruments are haywire.

51
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,875
Lieutenant Prieto,
is Counselor Troi all right?

52
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,291
PRIETO:
Yes, sir.

53
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,709
Just a little shaken.

54
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,875
We're being buffeted a bit.

55
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,417
Losing more power!

56
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:01,959
My flight control
computer's fried.

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,709
Main engineering.

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,041
ENGINEERING:
Lieutenant Commander
Leland T. Lynch here, sir.

59
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:10,166
How long before we can return
to warp power?

60
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,458
Captain, I'm in the middle

61
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,583
of realigning
the dilithium crystals.

62
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,041
PICARD:
There is an emergency.

63
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,125
We need warp drive.

64
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,125
How long?

65
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,250
20 minutes--
maybe more.

66
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,709
We don't have it, Mr. Lynch.

67
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,000
LYNCH:
I'll align it by hand.

68
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:21,917
Whatever it takes.

69
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,417
LYNCH:
Aye, sir.

70
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,041
Shuttle, this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

71
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,291
Your coordinates now read

72
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,625
two-three-seven
point one-zero-one.

73
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:30,875
Ben, you're dangerously close
to a planet.

74
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,458
PRIETO:
I can see it.

75
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,500
The planet is Vagra II, sir,
in the Zed Lapis sector.

76
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:36,959
Uninhabited.

77
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,458
Lieutenant, report.

78
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,083
This is Counselor Troi.

79
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,458
I'll relay, sir.

80
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,458
The pilot is busy.

81
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,834
We've lost most
of our impulse power.

82
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,875
Engineering, status report.

83
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,375
Working on it, Captain.

84
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:50,750
Three minutes.

85
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:52,458
But there are no guarantees.

86
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,208
PRIETO:
Captain, we're out of control.

87
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,000
We're caught
in the planet's gravity.

88
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,834
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

89

95
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,000
<i>We've lost all contact</i>

96
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,291

Forget the final check.

100
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,417

We're going directly
to start-up.

104
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,125
COMPUTER:
That procedure
is not recommended.

105
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,834
Understood. Now!

106
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,792
Prime matter/antimatter

Leland T. Lynch here, Captain.

112
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,125
We now have minimum warp drive.

113
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,834
Course plotted and set
for Vagra II, sir.

114
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,333
Warp eight.

You heard the order, Mr. Lynch.

117
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,750
Make it so.

118
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:42,959

Strange, sir.

121
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,250
There is no emergency signal
from the shuttle as yet.

122
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,458
What is this place, Mr. Data?

123
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,208
There is little information
in the library computer

124
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,917
other than the fact
of its existence.

125
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,291
Our sensors show
no signs of life-forms.

126
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,000
Virtually no vegetation.

127
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,250
Atmosphere?

128
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,250
DATA:
Minimum for
our needs, sir.

129
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,417
Standard orbit.

LA FORGE:
Aye, sir,
standard orbit.

131
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,583
I've located
the shuttle.

132
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,750
Life signs?

133
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:27,125
WORF:
Not yet, sir.

134
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,709
Still probing.

135
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,291
It appears to be buried
under a lot of debris.

136
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:38,083
I may have something, sir.

137
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,625
Faint life signs.

138
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,709
Very faint.

139
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,041
How many?

140
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,333
There's no way
of telling from here.

141
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,792
Data, can we beam up
the injured?

142
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,041
No, sir.

143
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,792
Our sensors
are not fully penetrating

144
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,083
whatever the debris is.

145
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:54,834
That's very unusual.

146
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:55,959
DATA:
Yes, sir.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,166
I cannot
explain.

148
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,500
Number One,
prepare your away team.

149
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:05,458
Right away.

150
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,625
Data!
Yar!

151
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,125
Dr. Crusher, have you been
monitoring all this?

152
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,250
BEVERLY:
Yes, I'll meet the away team
in Transporter Room Four.

153
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:50,834
BEVERLY:
Let's go.

154
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,291
The life signs
are weak.

155
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,875
RIKER:
What is this?

156
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,333
No idea.

157
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,041
We'll go around just to
be on the safe side.

158
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,583
Let's try
the other way.

159
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,667
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is Riker.

160
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:35,875
We've got a problem.

161
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:36,917
What kind of problem,
Number One?

162
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,792
RIKER:
I'm not sure yet.

163
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:42,125
There appears to be some kind
of a slick blocking our path.

164
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,250
We'll keep you apprised.

165
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,500
Maintain an open frequency.

166
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,000
RIKER:
Aye, sir.

167
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,667
Analysis, Mr. Data.

168
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:50,333
Inconclusive, sir.

169
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,667
I cannot tell you
what it is

170
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:54,208
but I can tell you
what it is not.

171
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,208
Explain.

172
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,291
There is no evidence

173
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,333
of neural
or circulatory systems.

174
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,417
No internal
organs.

175
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,625
Cellular structure,
unknown.

176
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,792
Does not have any proteins
which are known to us.

177
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:05,917
It's narrower over here.

178
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,000
We can get over it.

179
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,792
How is it moving, Data?

180
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:13,625
I do not
know, sir.

181
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:14,792
It does not
appear to have

182
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,750
a skeletal framework
or musculature.

183
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,375
Then what's causing it to move?

184
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,709
It appears
to be following us, sir.

185
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,875
No sign
of intelligence--

186
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,041
no brain as we know it--

187
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,000
yet evidence of thought,
Mr. Data?

188
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,750
Insufficient information, sir.

189
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,166
Is it a life-form, Data?

190
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,000
DATA:
Again, insufficient
information, sir.

191
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,125
Theorize.

192
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,875
It is possible.

193
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:42,709
(<i> rumbling growls</i> )

194
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,083
(<i> deep male voice</i> ):
<i>Very good, tin man.</i>

195
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,125
What is it, Number One?

196
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,250
What are you seeing?

197
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,417
Trouble.

198
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,208
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

199
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,875
<i>While on a mission</i>
<i>to rescue survivors</i>

200
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,709
<i>from an unexplained</i>
<i>shuttle crash</i>

201
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,291
<i>the away team has encountered</i>
<i>a strange creature</i>

202
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,041
<i>which seems able to assume</i>
<i>different forms</i>

203
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,291
<i>including one</i>
<i>which resembles humanoid.</i>

204
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,041
PICARD:
Easy, Number One.

205
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,583
Let's find out what it is
we're dealing with.

206
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,417
RIKER:
Agreed, Captain.

207
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,834
And, Number One, I don't believe
that the location of the crash

208
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,208
and the proximity
of the creature

209
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,583
is a coincidence.

210
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,500
I'm Commander William Riker
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

211
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,583
<i>I am Armus.</i>

212
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,083
<i>Why are you here?</i>

213
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,458
We mean you no harm.

214
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,709
We have injured crewmen
in the shuttlecraft.

215
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,792
We need to get to them.

216
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,333
May we pass?

217
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,291
<i>You haven't given me</i>
<i>a good enough reason.</i>

218
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,166
Preserving life, all life,
is very important to us.

219
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,667
<i>Why?</i>

220
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:14,959
We believe everything
in the universe

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,625
has a right to exist.

222
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:20,417
<i>An interesting notion</i>
<i>which I do not share.</i>

223
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,125
<i>You may leave</i>
<i>now if you wish.</i>

224
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,166
We are not going
without our shuttle crew.

225
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,625
<i>I warn you.</i>

226
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:28,834
YAR:
Enough.

227
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,041
We have people
who need attention.

228
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,917
We won't hurt you
but we must help them.

229
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,041
PICARD:
Number One?

230
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,083
The creature attacked us.

231
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,333
Lieutenant Yar is down.

232
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,208
It seems to feed
on our phaser energy.

233
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,458
We had no effect
on it.

234
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,583
PICARD:
What's Lieutenant Yar's
condition?

235
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,000
(<i> instrument beeping rapidly)</i>

236
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,041
PICARD:
Doctor Crusher, report.

237
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,291
She's dead.

238
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,375
Transporter room.

239
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,500
Get them up, now!

240
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,709
I need her in Sick Bay now.

241
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,417
Go to yellow alert,
Lieutenant Worf.

242
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,458
I'll be in Sick Bay.

243
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,542
Aye, sir.

244
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,250
Status, Doctor?

245
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,667
Unchanged.

246
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,166
Can you bring her back?

247
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,250
BEVERLY:
We'll see.

248
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,417
Neural
stimulator.

249
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,875
NURSE:
Neural stimulator
locked in.

250
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,834
BEVERLY:
Interlock
current feeds.

251
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,917
Set sensitivity factor to 4.4.

252
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,375
NURSE:
Affirmative.

253
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,500
TECHNICIAN:
Monitoring 2.3, 1.8.

254
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,208
There, you did it.

255
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,291
No, I've got her
on total support.

256
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,250
There is no independent
brain functioning.

257
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,625
TECHNICIAN:
Current feeds operating.

258
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,000
NURSE:
She's not
responding, Doctor.

259
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,792
Her synaptic network
is breaking down.

260
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:18,917
Inject norep.

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,625
NURSE:
Neurons are beginning
to depolarize.

262
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,000
Let's go for direct
reticular stimulation.

263
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:29,959
Direct?

264
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,333
Do it.

265
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,583
(<i> electronic zap</i> )

266
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,667
Increase to 70 microvolts.

267
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,166
(<i> electronic zap</i> )

268
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,500
85 microvolts.

269
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,834
(<i> electronic zap</i> )

270
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:51,959
Again.

271
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,208
(<i> electronic zap</i> )

272
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,041
(<i> whispering</i> ):
90.

273
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,166
(<i> electronic zap</i> )

274
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,375
BEVERLY:
Again.

275
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,750
(<i> electronic zap</i> )

276
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,375
BEVERLY:
Again.

277
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:06,583
(<i> electronic zap</i> )

278
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,917
(<i> electronic zap</i> )

279
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:11,834
(<i> electronic zap</i> )

280
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,542
She's gone.

281
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,542
Gone?

282
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,333
There was too much
synaptic damage.

283
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,625
That thing just sucked
the life right out of her.

284
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,417
There's nothing I can do.

285
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,083
(<i> communicator not functioning)</i>

286
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,208
(<i> suction noises</i> )

287
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,792
ARMUS:
<i>Your friends</i>
<i>have deserted you.</i>

288
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,750
<i>They're not coming back.</i>

289
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:25,041
You're wrong.

290
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:28,583
<i>I killed one of them.</i>

291
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,625
Yes.

292
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,250
I know.

293
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,875
<i>How could you</i>
<i>be in there</i>

294
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:38,291
<i>and know that?</i>

295
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,792
I felt her die.

296
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,583
<i>Do you want</i>
<i>to know why</i>

297
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,083
<i>I killed her?</i>

298
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,834
Your answer would be
meaningless.

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,667
That act had no reason.

300
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,500
<i>Exactly.</i>

301
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:55,917
<i>It had no meaning.</i>

302
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:59,250
<i>I did it</i>
<i>because I wanted to.</i>

303
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,667
<i>It amused me.</i>

304
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:06,375
No, you thought it would
amuse you, but it didn't.

305
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,583
You felt no satisfaction.

306
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,458
<i>No, it was too easy.</i>

307
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,667
You wanted her to suffer.

308
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,792
You have a great need.

309
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,417
<i>I need nothing.</i>

310
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,542
Liar.

311
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:31,125
End this.

312
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,542
Let us go.

313
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,250
<i>Not yet.</i>

314
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,583
They won't give you
what you want.

315
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,834
<i>And what is that?</i>

316
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,875
To break their spirit.

317
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,208
<i>Oh, is that</i>
<i>what I want?</i>

318
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,166
<i>If breaking their spirit</i>
<i>will amuse me</i>

319
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,750
<i>then that's</i>
<i>what I will have.</i>

320
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,667
Never.

321
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,834
She didn't do anything.
Her phaser was lowered.

322
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,917
LA FORGE:
She only wanted to get to
Troi and Lieutenant Prieto.

323
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,959
RIKER:
There was nothing at all
provocative about what she did.

324
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,667
BEVERLY:
It was a brutal,
senseless act.

325
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,917
Lieutenant Yar's death is
very painful for all of us.

326
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,667
We will have to deal with it
as best we can for now.

327
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,834
Until the shuttle crew is
safely beamed aboard this ship

328
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,041
our feelings will have to wait.

329
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,291
Is that understood?

330
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,250
Lieutenant Worf

331
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,542
you are now acting
Chief of Security.

332
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,875
I will do
my best, sir.

333
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,375
Doctor, what is the state
of the shuttle crew?

334
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,291
We're still receiving
faint life signs

335
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,333
but the sensor readings
are fluctuating.

336
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,041
They may not
be accurate.

337
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,208
Armus is capable of creating
undefined force fields.

338
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,125
In effect, we are powerless
to communicate

339
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,917
or use the transporter
unless it allows it.

340
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,250
A creature against whom
we seem to have no defense.

341
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,125
Number One?

342
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,709
It's down on that planet
waiting for us to come back.

343
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,041
It killed Tasha

344
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,375
and it could have killed us,
but it didn't.

345
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:02,583
Deanna and Ben are alive
for a reason.

346
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,041
And it knows that we're
not going anywhere

347
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,625
as long as they're
still alive.

348
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:09,417
Are you saying that its attack
on Yar was not arbitrary

349
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,709
but part of some tactic?

350
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,000
The only way to find out
is to go back down.

351
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,166
Commander, I may be able to see
something in the creature

352
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,458
which might be helpful.

353
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,625
Agreed.

354
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:18,875
Prepare your away team,
Number One.

355
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,625
Lieutenant Worf?

356
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,333
I will remain
on the ship.

357
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,291
WORF:
The object here
is not to engage

358
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,917
the creature
in battle.

359
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,834
The goal
is the safe return

360
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,500
of Counselor Troi
and Lieutenant Prieto.

361
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,917
I can best accomplish this
at the tactical station.

362
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,709
Very good.

363
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,792
Number One.

364
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,959
<i>Enterprise.</i>

365
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,500
PICARD:
Number One.

366
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:11,875
We're approaching
the shuttlecraft.

367
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,333
The creature
is covering it.

368
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,709
ARMUS:
<i>I lied to you.</i>

369
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,333
<i>They came back.</i>

370
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,208
Let me talk with them.

371
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,625
<i>No.</i>

372
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:24,917
Why?

373
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,333
Does the thought

374
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,208
of my having contact with them
make you uneasy?

375
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,250
<i>No, not being able</i>
<i>to contact</i> you--

376
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:36,125
<i>not knowing</i>
<i>if you are alive--</i>

377
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,625
<i>makes them uneasy.</i>

378
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:41,375
<i>Can't you feel</i>
<i>how worried they are?</i>

379
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:42,625
Yes.

380
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,834
Yes, they are worried.

381
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,667
<i>They care for you.</i>

382
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:50,792
<i>You must be</i>
<i>very special.</i>

383
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:53,125
We are members of a community.

384
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,291
We all care for one another.

385
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,542
<i>Equally?</i>

386
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,917
You were really surprised
they came back.

387
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,625
<i>Yes.</i>

388
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,959
Why?

389
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,542
Because the others did not?

390
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,583
<i>What others?</i>

391
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,083
You can't hide
the emptiness from me.

392
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,709
The others.

393
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,000
The ones who hurt you.

394
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,834
Who left you alone, rejected.

395
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,834
The ones who make you so angry.

396
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,291
<i>What do you</i>
<i>know of them?</i>

397
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,959
Only what you tell me.

398
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,959
<i>I will tell you</i>
<i>nothing.</i>

399
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,750
Not now...

400
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,333
but soon.

401
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:49,875
Captain, look at this.

402
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,625
The force
of the energy field

403
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:55,667
around the shuttlecraft
decreased for a few moments

404
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:57,709
when the creature
was draped over it.

405
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,625
PICARD:
But not low enough
to beam them out.

406
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:00,834
Almost.

407
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,875
It's approaching
the away team now

408
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,458
and the energy field
over the shuttlecraft

409
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,208
is back to
full intensity.

410
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,458
Chart it.

411
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,458
I want to see
if there's a pattern.

412
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,583
Aye, sir.

413
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,208
<i>She said you'd be back.</i>

414
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,458
Then she is alive.

415
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,291
<i>For now.</i>

416
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,166
<i>Why have you</i>
<i>returned?</i>

417
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,417
We have no choice.

418
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,000
We're here to negotiate
for our team.

419
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,583
What do you want?

420
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,083
<i>Maybe I want nothing.</i>

421
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,625
RIKER:
Then you would
have killed all of us.

422
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:39,792
Armus:
<i>I still might.</i>

423
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:40,875
RIKER:
What do you want?

424
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:42,041
Tell me.

425
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,125
Maybe we can reach
an accommodation.

426
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,959
<i>If I tell you, will</i>
<i>you give it to me?</i>

427
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,959
I might.

428
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,458
It depends.

429
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:52,458
I am a doctor.

430
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,333
I need to treat
our injured friends.

431
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,792
<i>Say, "please."</i>

432
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,500
Please.

433
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:02,500
<i>You ask nicely.</i>

434
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,291
<i>I will allow it.</i>

435
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,959
<i>Wait!</i>

436
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,083
<i>I've changed my mind.</i>

437
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,500
<i>Talk to her</i>
<i>from here.</i>

438
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:13,000
How...

439
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,542
Troi, can you hear me?

440
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,083
BEVERLY:
Deanna, are you all right?

441
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,041
Beverly?

442
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,208
TROI:
I can hear you.

443
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,083
Are you all right?

444
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,542
Yes.

445
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,166
We've encountered
some difficulty.

446
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,709
I know.

447
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,500
She needs our help.

448
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:42,000
<i>So what?</i>

449
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,500
Our friends are suffering
a few meters away

450
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:46,875
yet you block our path.

451
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:48,041
Why?

452
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,542
<i>You are all ungrateful.</i>

453
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,166
BEVERLY:
What is he
made of?

454
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,166
DATA:
It did not register
on the tricorder.

455
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:59,208
<i>"It?" Does that mean</i>
<i>I am not alive?</i>

456
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,834
No, clearly you
are some kind

457
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,667
of intelligent form.

458
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:08,291
<i>But you said</i>
<i>I did not register</i>
<i>on your instrument.</i>

459
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,208
<i>Perhaps your instruments</i>
<i>are useless.</i>

460
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,041
<i>Don't help him.</i>

461
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,125
Data.

462
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,792
Half meter
to the right, Geordi.

463
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,458
<i>Aren't you going</i>
<i>to lead him</i>

464
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,542
<i>to his sight again, robot?</i>

465
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,041
No, you will just move it again

466
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,333
and I will not help you
hurt him.

467
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,041
<i>Then give it to him.</i>

468
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,875
<i>I will find</i>
<i>something else</i>
<i>to amuse me.</i>

469
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:08,750
<i>You said they</i>
<i>wouldn't amuse me.</i>

470
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:11,000
<i>You were right.</i>

471
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,542
And the emptiness remains.

472
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,166
You sound so alone.

473
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,083
<i>I am alone.</i>

474
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,583
Abandoned.

475
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:28,667
Who deserted you?

476
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:32,250
<i>Creatures whose beauty</i>
<i>now dazzles all who see them.</i>

477
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:36,250
<i>They would not exist</i>
<i>without me.</i>

478
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,166
You were together.

479
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:43,458
<i>They perfected a means</i>
<i>of bringing to the surface</i>

480
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,792
<i>all that was evil</i>
<i>and negative within...</i>

481
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:50,000
<i>erupting, spreading,</i>
<i>connecting.</i>

482
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:53,125
<i>In time, it formed</i>
<i>a second skin--</i>

483
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,041
<i>dank and vile.</i>

484
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,333
You.

485
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,458
<i>Yes.</i>

486
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,583
They discarded you and left.

487
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,709
<i>And here I am.</i>

488
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:12,625
You have my pity.

489
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:18,000
(<i> rumbling growls</i> )

490
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,875
<i>Your pity?</i>

491
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:23,834
<i>Save that for yourself!</i>

492
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,834
(<i> no audio</i> )

493
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:40,917
Data!

494
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:43,000
Data, something's got me!

495
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,917
ARMUS:
<i>Touch him, and he dies.</i>

496
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:45,875
No!

497
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:47,291
No, don't!

498
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,208
<i>Enterprise.</i>

499
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,750
Armus has... enveloped
Commander Riker.

500
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:04,041
I'm beaming you up.

501
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:07,917
<i>If any of you leave now,</i>
<i>he dies.</i>

502
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,709
<i>And so do the survivors</i>
<i>of the crash.</i>

503
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,125
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

504
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:35,000
<i>There is grave danger</i>
<i>to the crew on Vagra II.</i>

505
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:36,458
<i>My first officer is missing--</i>

506
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,000
<i>attacked by this entity</i>
<i>known as Armus.</i>

507
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:42,792
Captain, perhaps you
should take a look at this.

508
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:46,291
WORF:
We have the chart
of the energy field

509
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:47,750
surrounding the shuttle.

510
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:49,250
There are a lot
of fluctuations.

511
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:51,458
Yes, but there<i> is</i>
a pattern.

512
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,166
Here is where it killed
Lieutenant Yar

513
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:56,750
and here is where it
absorbed Commander Riker.

514
00:26:56,792 --> 00:27:00,166
And here, here, where
the energy is lowest?

515
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,458
Both times, it had
enveloped the shuttle.

516
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,875
It has something to do
with Counselor Troi.

517
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,458
PICARD:
Somehow, when it's
dealing with her

518
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,458
the energy field
is affected.

519
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,667
I want to talk to her.

520
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:14,792
I'm going to beam down.

521
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,125
Lieutenant Worf,
you have the conn.

522
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,417
TROI:
Imzadi!

523
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:24,041
No, please stop hurting him.

524
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,125
ARMUS:
<i>He resists.</i>

525
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:31,208
<i>If he would give himself over,</i>
<i>the pain would diminish.</i>

526
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,709
<i>He struggles.</i>

527
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,917
<i>You should feel</i>
<i>his strength.</i>

528
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,542
I can.

529
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:42,041
<i>Should I let him go?</i>

530
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,583
You only ask to torment me.

531
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,375
<i>Perhaps.</i>

532
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:48,542
How should I answer?

533
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,333
What can I offer except myself?

534
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,709
<i>And would you give</i>
<i>yourself for him?</i>

535
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,500
<i>Would you give</i>
<i>that much?</i>

536
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,291
Yes, without hesitation.

537
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,959
<i>Just for him?</i>

538
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,250
No, not just for him.

539
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,458
I would do the same
for any of the others.

540
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:13,375
Armus, you have me.

541
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,291
Let them go.

542
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:20,375
<i>Perhaps...</i>
<i>Ah, another has arrived.</i>

543
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,750
<i>You are the one in charge?</i>

544
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,000
Is Commander Riker alive?

545
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,250
<i>Answer, tin man.</i>

546
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:50,750
I would guess that death
is no longer sufficient

547
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:52,333
to alleviate
its boredom.

548
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:54,041
Therefore, Commander
Riker is alive.

549
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,291
<i>Maybe.</i>

550
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:08,333
<i>Don't you want to ask me</i>
<i>what I want?</i>

551
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,041
No.

552
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,500
<i>Not even to protect</i>
<i>your own existence?</i>

553
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,166
I want to see my people
in the shuttle.

554
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,917
<i>Entertain me.</i>

555
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:28,041
Hm-mm.

556
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,250
<i>Then I will do it myself.</i>

557
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:43,083
<i>You, tin man--</i>

558
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,333
<i>Now, tell me,</i>
<i>how would you feel</i>

559
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:51,792
<i>if</i> you<i> were</i>
<i>the instrument</i>

560
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:53,834
<i>of death</i>
<i>for your leader?</i>

561
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,417
Don't struggle, Data.

562
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:58,583
I have no control over
what you do with the phaser.

563
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:01,583
Therefore, I would not be
the instrument of his death.

564
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,458
<i>Perhaps killing the doctor</i>

565
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,542
<i>would engender</i>
<i>more feeling.</i>

566
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:10,583
No, the control
is still yours.

567
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,500
<i>And what about</i>
<i>you, Doctor?</i>

568
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:15,709
<i>Are you ready to die?</i>

569
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,583
<i>Tell me you are</i>
<i>not afraid.</i>

570
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:20,166
I am afraid.

571
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:22,041
<i>Beg me to</i>
<i>spare you.</i>

572
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,166
No.

573
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,166
<i>One of you is going to die.</i>

574
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,333
<i>And you, Doctor, get to choose.</i>

575
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:32,917
<i>You don't like that,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

576
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:35,291
Then I choose myself.

577
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,709
<i>No.</i>

578
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,917
<i>You are going to live.</i>

579
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:40,959
<i>One of them dies.</i>

580
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:46,000
<i>Maybe this one.</i>

581
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:48,375
<i>Though I would not</i>
<i>call it death</i>

582
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:50,625
<i>since he is only a device.</i>

583
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,250
<i>Tell me,</i>
<i>tin man</i>

584
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:53,583
<i>how does</i>
<i>it feel</i>

585
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,291
<i>to face your</i>
<i>own extinction?</i>

586
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:58,166
Curious.

587
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:59,417
(<i> phaser drops to the ground)</i>

588
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,750
You are capable
of great sadism and cruelty.

589
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,959
Interesting--

590
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,875
no redeeming qualities.

591
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:13,250
<i>So what do you think?</i>

592
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,125
I think you should be destroyed.

593
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:18,333
<i>A moral judgment</i>
<i>from a machine?</i>

594
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,291
Data.

595
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,834
Armus, we are finished
dealing with you.

596
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:26,667
<i>I have your man in here</i>
<i>and the others in the shuttle.</i>

597
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:27,959
It doesn't matter.

598
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,083
We will no longer be
a source of amusement.

599
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,250
<i>I can kill them.</i>

600
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,875
Yes, you can

601
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:35,291
but only I can command them.

602
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,000
They follow my orders.

603
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,000
<i>Have them amuse me.</i>

604
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,375
Only if you will let me see
my people on the shuttle first.

605
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:42,333
I must see them.

606
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:43,917
<i>Not possible.</i>

607
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:47,125
Then our business with you
is concluded.

608
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:50,125
<i>And you claim you care</i>
<i>about your comrades.</i>

609
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,625
I care.

610
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,166
Which is why
I must see them.

611
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,041
<i>You want to see your people?</i>

612
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:04,875
<i>Then here.</i>

613
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:07,417
<i>Look...</i>

614
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,166
<i>at this one.</i>

615
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:17,250
BEVERLY:
He's alive.

616
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,792
(<i> gulping and gasping</i> )

617
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:20,333
Don't move.

618
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:24,667
PICARD:
Is he
all right?

619
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,333
All signs
show normal.

620
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:28,959
RIKER:
So much
frustration

621
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,208
it had to get
rid of me.

622
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,959
Now, let me see the others.

623
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,750
<i>No.</i>

624
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,667
I will not allow my people
to entertain you until you do.

625
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:46,959
<i>They are incapable</i>
<i>of entertaining me.</i>

626
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,500
PICARD:
I want the four
of you out of here.

627
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:53,000
<i>Enterprise,</i> beam
up the away team
immediately.

628
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,250
WORF:
Aye, sir.

629
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

630
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,667
They're no longer involved.

631
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:01,542
This is between you and me.

632
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,125
<i>They may leave.</i>

633
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,333
Now...

634
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,667
<i>I want to leave</i>
<i>this place.</i>

635
00:33:26,709 --> 00:33:28,583
You want me to give
you transportation?

636
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,166
<i>For which</i>

637
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:33,417
<i>I will trade you lives.</i>

638
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:35,583
I must see my people
in the shuttle.

639
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,000
<i>Will you give me</i>

640
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,417
<i>what I want?</i>

641
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,417
I have the means

642
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:43,959
but, first,
I must see my people.

643
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,000
<i>If you must.</i>

644
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:57,875
Troi, are you
all right?

645
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:59,750
Yes, but Ben
is not.

646
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,291
He's alive.

647
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:10,917
Were you able to help Tasha?

648
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:16,667
No.

649
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:22,125
Troi...

650
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:25,917
Troi, we must talk.

651
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,208
I believe
it's possible

652
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,583
to outmaneuver
this creature

653
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:30,625
and beam you and Ben
back up to the ship.

654
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:31,959
We've been monitoring

655
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,041
the energy field
that surrounds the shuttle.

656
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,875
When the creature is here,
the field weakens.

657
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,500
Do you know why?

658
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,750
The creature
is filled with rage--

659
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:46,041
undirected, unfocused rage.

660
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:49,000
When he confronts it,
his guard goes down

661
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:52,208
because he's feeling it
instead of suppressing it.

662
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,333
Acknowledging his needs

663
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,291
makes him
vulnerable.

664
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:57,667
What caused the rage?

665
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
He was left here--

666
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:02,125
abandoned.

667
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,583
WORF:
The force field
will have to drop

668
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:14,458
below 2.7 before
we can beam them up.

669
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,458
<i>Satisfied?</i>

670
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,000
Yes.

671
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:23,166
<i>Then, can we leave?</i>

672
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,625
Where do you
want to go?

673
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,250
Do you want to try to find
those who left you here?

674
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,375
<i>She told you</i>
<i>about them!</i>

675
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:38,583
How long have
you been here?

676
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:41,750
<i>Since they left--</i>

677
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:44,083
<i>a very long time.</i>

678
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,542
A long time to be alone.

679
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:47,291
<i>Save your</i>
<i>compassion.</i>

680
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,083
<i>It's revolting.</i>

681
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:53,542
<i>You offer it like a prize</i>
<i>when, in fact, it's an insult.</i>

682
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,250
Because you feel unworthy.

683
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,417
<i>You overrate</i>
<i>your gift.</i>

684
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:01,750
<i>You humans are puny--</i>
<i>weak.</i>

685
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,709
But our spirit is indomitable.

686
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,166
<i>And still, you die</i>
<i>from a flick of my power.</i>

687
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,625
A great poet once said

688
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:14,333
"All spirits are enslaved
that serve things evil."

689
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:18,000
<i>You do not understand.</i>

690
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,458
<i>I do not serve things evil--</i>

691
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,125
<i>I</i> am<i> evil.</i>

692
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,458
Oh, no, you are not.

693
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,291
<i>I am a skin of evil</i>

694
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:31,792
<i>left here by a race</i>
<i>of titans who believed</i>

695
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:34,917
<i>if they rid themselves of me,</i>
<i>they would free</i>

696
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,834
<i>the bonds of</i>
<i>destructiveness.</i>

697
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:39,583
Yes, so here you are.

698
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,417
Feeding on your own loneliness,
consumed by your own pain

699
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,291
believing
your own lies.

700
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,625
Set the computer.

701
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:50,875
When the energy level
reaches 2.6.205

702
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,125
automatically beam up
Troi and Prieto.

703
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:55,041
We'll do a parallel
transport on the captain.

704
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,250
Yes, sir.

705
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,041
You say you
are true evil?

706
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,542
Shall I tell you
what true evil is?

707
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:05,625
It is to submit
to you.

708
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,417
It's when
we surrender
our freedom--

709
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,458
our dignity--

710
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,709
instead of defying you.

711
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,083
<i>I will kill you</i>
<i>and those in there!</i>

712
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:15,709
But you will still be here...

713
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,375
in this place.

714
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:18,333
Forever.

715
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,333
Alone.

716
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:20,291
Immortal.

717
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,333
(<i> gasping and growling</i> )

718
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,792
WORF:
Stand by for
parallel transport.

719
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:29,125
The energy level
has dropped to 2.6.3.

720
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,625
That's your real fear--

721
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,250
never to die.

722
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:36,500
Never again to be united
with those who left you here.

723
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:38,625
(<i> gasping roar</i> )

724
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,333
WORF:
Energy field
is 2.6.

725
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,750
Computer
beginning
transport.

726
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:49,917
(<i> gasping</i> )

727
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,834
I'm not taking you anywhere.

728
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:57,166
(<i> wailing and screaming</i> )

729
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,166
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 41602.1</i>

730
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:13,375
<i>The shuttlecraft</i>
<i>has been destroyed</i>

731
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:14,917
<i>to prevent any possibility</i>

732
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,166
<i>of Armus leaving the planet.</i>

733
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:19,208
<i>Vagra II will be</i>
<i>declared off-limits</i>

734
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,333
<i>but the damage has been done.</i>

735
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:27,208
<i>One of the saddest duties</i>
<i>I've ever had to perform</i>

736
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,500
<i>is now ahead of me.</i>

737
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:44,375
We're here together to honor
our friend and comrade--

738
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,250
Lieutenant
Natasha Yar.

739
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:50,041
Coming to terms
with the loss
of a colleague

740
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:53,959
is perhaps the
most difficult
task we must face

741
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,125
in the work we have
chosen to pursue.

742
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:59,208
We will all
find time

743
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,625
to grieve for her in
the days that are ahead

744
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:07,083
but, for now,
she has asked

745
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:11,250
that we celebrate
her life... with this.

746
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,166
Hello, my friends.

747
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:34,000
You are here now watching this
image of me because I have died.

748
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:38,250
It probably happened
while I was on duty...

749
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:40,792
and quickly,
which is what I expected.

750
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:44,166
Never forget I died doing

751
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,709
exactly
what I chose to do.

752
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,458
What I want you to
know is how much
I loved my life

753
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,667
and those of you
who shared it with me.

754
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,500
You are my family.

755
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:59,333
You all know
where I came from

756
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:01,291
and what my life
was like before.

757
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:04,333
But Starfleet took that
frightened angry, young girl

758
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,917
and tempered her.

759
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:08,834
I have been blessed
with your friendship
and your love.

760
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,166
Will Riker--

761
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,625
you are the best.

762
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,083
You trusted me

763
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,375
you encouraged me

764
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,208
and most of all,
you made me laugh.

765
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:29,083
Deanna, you are capable
of so much love.

766
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,917
You taught me without
ever having to say a word.

767
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,792
I realized I could be feminine
without losing anything.

768
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:45,959
Ah, Worf...

769
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:49,458
we are so
much alike,
you and I--

770
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,667
both warriors--

771
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:54,041
orphans who found ourselves
this family.

772
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:57,792
I hope I met death

773
00:40:57,834 --> 00:40:59,625
with my eyes
wide open.

774
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:05,250
Beverly, your
fierce devotion
comes from within.

775
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,291
It can't
be diminished.

776
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:12,625
From you, I have learned
to strive for excellence

777
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:14,500
no matter
what the personal cost.

778
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:20,125
Wesley, I'm sorry
I won't be able

779
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:23,583
to see you grow
into the exceptional
man you'll become.

780
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:28,000
But your kindness
and innocence are ageless.

781
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:31,750
Geordi...

782
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:38,750
in those moments
I felt the most despair

783
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:39,959
you took my hand

784
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,583
and helped me to see
things differently.

785
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,875
You taught me
to look beyond
the moment.

786
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:48,041
My friend, Data--

787
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,875
you see things
with the wonder
of a child.

788
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,917
And that makes you more human
than any of us.

789
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,291
Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

790
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:09,041
I wish I could say you've
been like a father to me

791
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:10,250
but I've never had one

792
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,000
so I don't know
what it feels like.

793
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:17,125
But if there were someone
in this universe

794
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:20,417
I could choose to be like--

795
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:25,041
someone who I would want
to make proud of me--

796
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,083
it's you.

797
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:33,500
You who have the heart
of an explorer

798
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,208
and the soul
of a poet.

799
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:38,875
So, you'll
understand
when I say

800
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:43,083
"death is that state

801
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:46,291
"in which one exists only
in the memory of others...

802
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,750
which is why it is not an end."

803
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,500
No good-byes.

804
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,375
Just good
memories.

805
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:02,333
Hailing frequencies
closed, sir.

806
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:12,583
<i>Au revoir,</i> Natasha.

807
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,709
The gathering is concluded.

808
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,125
Sir...

809
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:51,834
the purpose
of this gathering...

810
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,583
confuses me.

811
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:57,000
Oh? How so?

812
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:02,542
My thoughts
are not for Tasha

813
00:44:02,583 --> 00:44:04,208
but for myself.

814
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:07,834
I keep thinking

815
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,667
how empty it will be
without her presence.

816
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,583
Did I miss
the point?

817
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:18,625
No, you didn't,
Data--

818
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:19,709
you got it.
