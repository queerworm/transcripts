00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,125
(<i> water splashes</i> )

2
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,375
There you are.

3
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:17,291
What's wrong?

4
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,291
Something jabbed me
here in the calf.

5
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:24,667
Ooh.

6
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,500
O'Brien, Commander Riker's
been injured.

7
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:35,250
Lock on and bring him up.
O'BRIEN: Stand by.

8
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,500
Geordi, it's just...
A scratch, right.

9
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:40,125
Sorry, Commander,
we can't take any chances.

10
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,834
We're the first survey team
to set foot on this planet.

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,458
We don't know
what the risks are.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,458
(<i> beeping</i> )

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,333
LA FORGE:
O'Brien, what's the holdup?

14
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,291
The transporter's detected
unidentified microbes

15
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,041
in Commander Riker's body.

16
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,834
Well, can't the biofilters
screen them out?

17
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:59,083
Apparently not, but Dr. Pulaski
has been notified.

18
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,041
Acknowledged.

19
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,375
I wasn't ready
to leave here anyway.

20
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,750
Here's the biofilter's
analysis of the microbes.

21
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:14,583
PULASKI:
That's not much to go on.

22
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:18,166
I can override and beam
Commander Riker aboard.

23
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,625
No.

24
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:22,458
I better go down and make
an evaluation there.

25
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:34,000
I hope these are
the right coordinates.

26
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,625
Just kidding, Doctor.

27
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,792
I know how much you love
the transporter.

28
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:41,792
About as much as I love
comical Transporter Chiefs.

29
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:47,083
Ready?

30
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,041
RIKER:
Over here, Doctor.

31
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,166
Fill me in.

32
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:12,291
I was walking along,
minding my own business

33
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,333
doing a simple
geological sweep.

34
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,000
Something stuck
me in the leg.

35
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,583
Any pain?

36
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,375
No, just a little
numb, that's all.

37
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:21,500
Do you know
what it was that stuck you?

38
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,917
We've been looking for it...
no luck.

39
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,500
Well, whatever it is,
it left something behind.

40
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,542
I'm going to take you
up to Sick Bay.

41
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:35,208
O'Brien, this
is Dr. Pulaski.

42
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,333
Medical override
is authorized.

43
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,000
Acknowledged.

44
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,917
This is the strangest feeling...

45
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,875
My whole leg just went dead.

46
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:25,166
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

47
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:29,166
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

48
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,333

53
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,792
<i>During a geological survey</i>
<i>on Surata IV,</i>

54
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:49,000
<i>Commander Riker</i>

<i>by an unidentified microbe.</i>

56
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:53,667
Number One.
Captain.

57
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:56,041
Put your foot where
it didn't belong, hmm?

58
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,542
Doctor said
she was getting bored.

59
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,417
I just thought
I'd give her a challenge.

60
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,166
That you did.

61
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,625
The Commander's nervous system
has been invaded

62
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,959
by an unknown
microorganism.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,875
Not a bacteria,
not a virus,

64
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:13,125
but with the
elements of both.

65
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,750
There's the point of entry.

66
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:23,000
The microbes are infecting
the great sciatic nerve.

67
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,667
And they are multiplying
at an incredible rate.

68
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,542
There.

69
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,542
Can you remove it?
Not surgically.

70
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,083
The organisms
fused to the nerve,

71
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,166
intertwining
at the molecular level.

72
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,500
That's why
the transporter's biofilters

73
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,291
weren't able to extract it.

74
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,667
There's no evidence
of nerve damage,

75
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:48,125
but the organisms are
impeding nervous function.

76
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,417
My leg's still asleep.

77
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,667
Prognosis?

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,542
The infection
is spreading.

79
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,625
It will eventually
reach the brain.

80
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,792
And if it interfered
with neural activity there?

81
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:03,208
Commander Riker
could die.

82
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,875
How can I help?

83
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,542
I need to know more
about its composition.

84
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,583
And for that,
you need a sample.
Exactly.

85
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,709
Commander Data,
Mr. La Forge,

86
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,000
prepare to beam
down to the planet.

87
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,250
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir.

88
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,375
I must reiterate.

89
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,000
It would be better
if I went alone.

90
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,625
Don't like my company?

91
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,000
Your company is
not at issue.

92
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,000
Your vulnerability
to the microorganism is.

93
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,625
I'll watch
where I step.

94
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:37,542
Besides, how do we know
this bug doesn't like androids

95
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,125
more than it likes humans?

96
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,291
Possible,
but highly unlikely.

97
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,417
In any event,
why risk both of us?

98
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,083
Because I know
exactly where

99
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,834
Commander Riker
was when it happened.

100
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,959
Mr. O'Brien, energize.

101
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,500
He was right over here.

102
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,375
I am detecting
no animal life-forms

103
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,250
within 50 kilometers.

104
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,333
However, I am reading
extensive animal remains,

105
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,083
mostly fossilized.

106
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,917
A graveyard?

107
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,375
I do not know.

108
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:28,583
Data.

109
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,792
Data, look at this.

110
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,125
The structure
is rhizomatous.

111
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,375
Hmm.

112
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,417
Careful.

113
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,375
I am always careful.

114
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,375
It appears to be dead.

115
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,333
I'm not so sure.

116
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,667
I'm seeing thermal variations.

117
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,333
Let it go for a second, Data.

118
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,917
Let's try something.

119
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,500
Maybe it likes humans
more than androids.

120
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,834
If you are correct,

121
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,875
you are placing yourself
in grave danger.

122
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,834
Well, I'm counting
on those great android...

123
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,208
reflexes of yours.

124
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,750
That must be what
we're looking for.

125
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:09,792
I would tend to agree.

126
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,166
LA FORGE:
Stand by, O'Brien.

127
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,458
Got it.
Energize.

128
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,458
Thanks, O'Brien.

129
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,583
Another minute and we'd
have been fossils ourselves.

130
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,250
Not precisely,
Geordi.

131
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,375
True fossilization
requires several millennia.

132
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:41,208
Here's your
sample, Captain.

133
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,709
Get it to Sick Bay
right away.

134
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,583
Report.

135
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,875
Captain, Commander Riker's
injury was not accidental.

136
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,417
Certain vines on the planet

137
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,583
evidently seek out
warm-blooded beings

138
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,458
and deliberately
infect them.

139
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,625
To what end?
Unknown, sir.

140
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:01,250
It is conceivable there is a
symbiotic relationship involved.

141
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,333
Go on.

142
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,208
There are numerous
animal remains in the area

143
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,875
leading me to hypothesize

144
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:11,208
that the vines
could be predatory.

145
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,208
And the vines infect animals

146
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,625
in order to kill them?

147
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,333
It is possible.

148
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,500
For Commander Riker's sake,

149
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:22,250
I hope my hypothesis
is in error.

150
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,458
Unfortunately,
Commander Data,

151
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,166
your hypotheses rarely are.

152
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,500
All negative.

153
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,375
There's nothing that will
cure this infection?

154
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:51,291
This microorganism
is very mysterious.

155
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,542
I can't even figure out
what's keeping it alive.

156
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,917
Or how to kill it.

157
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,750
Oh, I can kill it,

158
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:01,208
but not without destroying
the nerves it's inhabiting.

159
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,709
I know you're doing
your best, Doctor.

160
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,166
My best may not
be good enough.

161
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,792
Comfortable?

162
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:31,333
Why wouldn't I
be comfortable?

163
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,166
They're waiting on me
hand and foot.

164
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,583
I just hope they don't find
out that I'm faking it.

165
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:39,166
I wish you were faking it.

166
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,458
I've seen the thorn, Number One.

167
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,458
Yes, the doctor
showed it to me, too.

168
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,291
Rather harmless-looking,
isn't it?

169
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,834
And deadly.

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,583
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,625
Well, these things happen.

172
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,417
When least expected.

173
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,166
I'm surprised they don't
happen more often.

174
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,834
After all, we are
exploring the unknown.

175
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,709
And the unknown
can be benign...

176
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,083
or malevolent.

177
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,083
Captain, one of the things
I've learned on these voyages

178
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,291
and on this ship
and from you

179
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:22,667
is that most life-forms act out
of an instinct for survival

180
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:24,250
not out of malice.

181
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,083
It's an important lesson.

182
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,709
And I admire your lack
of resentment, Number One.

183
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,166
If you drop a hammer
on your foot,

184
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,458
it's hardly useful
to get mad at the hammer.

185
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,750
Anything?

186
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,083
Not yet.

187
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,667
What can I do?

188
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,333
You can get
out of my hair.

189
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,500
Aye, aye, Doctor.

190
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:10,041
(<i> instrument whirring</i> )

191
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,125
This bug is persistent,
I'll admit that.

192
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,125
But I'm not worried.

193
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,709
We Rikers are
ornery, too.

194
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,250
Matter of fact,
my great-grandfather

195
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,166
once got bit by a rattlesnake.

196
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,208
After three days
of intense pain,

197
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,083
the snake died.

199
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,625
You're a very

200
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,125
I try.

201
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,375
Yes, you're making quite
an effort to be cheerful.

202
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:50,458
You of all people should know.

203
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,875
You feel what anyone
in your position would feel.

204
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:58,208
As the First Officer
on this ship,

205
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,041
I have to set an example.

206
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,083
Even now?

207
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,125
Now more than ever.

208
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,000
Deanna, facing death

209
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,750
is the ultimate test
of character.

210
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,458
I don't want to die,
but if I have to,

211
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,667
I'd like to do it
with a little pride.

212
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:21,375
And a lot of impudence.

213
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:24,166
You bet.

214
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,542
Dying is bad enough,

215
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,959
but to lose my sense of humor?

216
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,458
Forget it.

217
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,709

It's spread to
the spinal column.

222
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,959
It's weakening his
autonomic nervous system.

223
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,625
Judging by its present
rate of growth

224
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,750
and its infiltration pattern,

225
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:11,500
the infection will spread
to the brain within an hour.

The wave patterns are

Why won't they stabilize?

249
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,375
Wait. I've found
the right amplitude.

250
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:43,917
There.

251
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:47,583
The patterns are steadier.

252
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,959
Is the stimulation preventing
the infection from taking hold?

253
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,875
For now.

254
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:55,750
The vertex waves

Marvelous.

264
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,500
How easily humans do that.

265
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,834
I still need much practice.

266
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,333
There's some puzzles
down on the...

267
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,417
...down on the planet
that the Captain wants answered.

268
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,709
He suggested I take you with me
on the away team that
I'll be leading.

269
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,458
I shall endeavor
to function adequately, sir.

270
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,917
Yes.

271
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:10,000
When the Captain
suggested you,

272
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,375
I looked up your record.

273
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,417
Yes, sir.
A wise procedure, sir, always.

274
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,000
Then your rank of Lieutenant
Commander is honorary?

275
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,417
No, sir.
Starfleet class of '78.

276
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,709
Honors in probability
mechanics and exobiology.

277
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,166
But your file says
that you're a...

278
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,417
A machine. Correct, sir.

279
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,333
Does that trouble you?

280
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,959
To be honest,
yes, a little.

281
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,375
Understood, sir.

282
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,417
Prejudice is very human.

283
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,041
Now that does trouble me.

284
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,166
Do you consider yourself
superior to us?

285
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,500
I am superior, sir,
in many ways,

286
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:40,000
but I would gladly
give it up to be human.

287
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,917
Nice to meet you... Pinocchio.

288
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,917
A joke.

289
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,625
Ah. Intriguing.

290
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,667
You're going to be an
interesting companion, Mr. Data.

291
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,041
What should I say?
How do I act?

292
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,208
What do I do?

293
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,333
Guinan, I need your help.

294
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,208
Could you step
over here a minute?

295
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,125
Sounds simple enough.

296
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,834
Now, first words out of your
mouth are the most important.

297
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,208
You may want to start
with something like this.

298
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:31,125
You are the most beautiful
woman in the galaxy.

299
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:37,250
But that might not work.

300
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,625
Yes.
Yes, it would.

301
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,250
You don't know how long
I've wanted to tell you that.

302
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,667
But you were afraid.
Yes.

303
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:49,166
Of me?
Of us. Of what we might become.

304
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,667
Commander...

305
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,667
RIKER:
Or that you might think
that was a line.

306
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:54,583
Maybe I do think
it's a line.

307
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,250
And you think
I'm not sincere?

308
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,583
I didn't say that.

309
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,250
There's nothing's wrong
with a line.

310
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,041
It's like a knock
at the door.

311
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,500
RIKER:
Then you're inviting me in?

312
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,000
GUINAN:
I'm not sending you away.

313
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,291
RIKER:
That's more than I expected.

314
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,959
Is it as much as you hoped?

315
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,333
To hope is to recognize
the possibility.

316
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,583
I had only dreams.

317
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,792
Dreams can
be dangerous.

318
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:13,333
Not these dreams.

319
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,709
I dream of a galaxy where
your eyes are the stars

320
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,709
and the universe
worships the night.

321
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,834
Careful.

322
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,250
Putting me
on a pedestal so high,

323
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,375
you may not be able
to reach me.

324
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:27,750
Then I'll learn how to fly.

325
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:31,583
You are the heart in my day
and the soul in my night.

326
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,792
I don't think
this is my style.

327
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,208
Shut up, kid.

328
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,750
Tell me more about my eyes.

329
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,625
I didn't want to leave
without saying good-bye.

330
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:45,166
I don't like good-byes.

331
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,667
How about "until next time"?

332
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:50,250
How about until next time.

333
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:54,917
It's been a pleasure
working with you, Commander.

334
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,875
The feeling is mutual...

335
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,500
Counselor.

336
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:01,041
I'm supposed to know
how everyone feels,

337
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:04,542
but I can't read you
right now.

338
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,333
Perhaps your own feelings
are getting in the way.

339
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:11,041
My job is to help others
sort out their emotions.

340
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,041
My own feelings
are beside the point.

341
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,709
Not to me.

342
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,250
Our feelings are what
make us all human.

343
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,125
Are you feeling sad?

344
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:33,291
Yes, I am.

345
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,291
So am I.

346
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,333

347
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,500
Experiencing feelings of

00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:50,542
warmth and friendship.

349
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,083
He's reliving memories.

350
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:55,709
It's a natural side effect
of neural stimulation.

351
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,625
Look at this.

352
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:03,000
The organisms' metabolism
has changed.

353
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,834
I wonder if the stimulation
is affecting them somehow.

354
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,166
I'm going to refocus
the impulse pattern

355
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,750
on the interpretive cortex.

356
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:11,625
To intensify
his memories?

357
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,250
Exactly.

358
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,917
We'll see if that has
any effect on the microbes.

359
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,291
(<i> man laughing</i> )

360
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,875
Everyone!

361
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:50,959
We've brought
the visitors.

362
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,125
Please, enjoy what we have.

363
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,542
Gentlemen...

364
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,959
if this is what
you call enhancement,

365
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,917
you've got a gift
for understatement.

366
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:34,542
What's a knockout
like you doing

367
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,500
in a computer-generated
gin joint like this?

368
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:39,750
Waiting for you.

369
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:41,458
Waiting for me?

370
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,875
You can't be serious.

371
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,208
Oh, yes, Will.

372
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,500
I've never been
more serious in my life.

373
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,625
PULASKI:
Something wrong?

374
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:58,709
No, it's just that Commander
Riker's emotions are...

375
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,750
rather passionate.

376
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:03,333
As in erotic?

377
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:06,458
Very much so.

378
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:13,125
A dream?

379
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,041
Is that what this is?

380
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,875
Is that what I am?

381
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:21,166
I know you're
a computer-generated image...

382
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,959
but your smell

383
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
your touch,
the way you feel,

384
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:33,417
even the things you say
and think seem so real.

385
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:37,458
Thank you.

386
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,291
How far can
this relationship go?

387
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:46,333
I mean, how real are you?

388
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,083
As real as you
need me to be.

389
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:05,000
You resist.

390
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:08,250
Don't you find me
attractive?

391
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:12,333
Yes, I find you
very attractive.

392
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,834
You attract me like
no man ever has.

393
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,375
It's not my function to

394
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:20,500
seduce or be seduced

395
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:23,083
by the leader
of another world.

396
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,875
It's not the reason.
No, it's not.

397
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:28,667
But will you still respect me
in the morning?

398
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:31,083
Mm, I hope so.

399
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,333
William, is something wrong?

400
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,125
What do you mean?

401
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:38,000
Do you not like girls?

402
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,125
Of course I do.

403
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:49,625
Oh, is there a special technique
to this foot washing?

404
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:54,083
You generally start
at the top

405
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:56,291
and work your way down.

406
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:01,542
I think I can handle that.

407
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:12,291
I was hoping you might.

408
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:26,291
The organisms responded
all right.

409
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,875
Their growth rate has doubled.

410
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,959
Then all we've done
is make things worse.

411
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,375
Now we know the organisms'
growth rate<i> is</i> related

412
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:47,625
to the memories
he's experiencing.

413
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,875
Or the emotions
that they produce.

414
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:53,083
Well, different mental processes
generate different chemicals.

415
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:56,417
Perhaps the organisms
are sensitive

416
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,041
to brain endorphins.

417
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:01,709
Then if some types of
endorphins attract them...

418
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,333
Others will repel them.

419
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,500
I'm going to change
the differential current pattern

420
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:11,083
and see what happens.

421
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,417
We are not going
without our shuttle crew.

422
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:24,750
<i>I warn you.</i> 
YAR: Enough.

423
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:27,083
We have people
who need attention.

424
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,750
We won't hurt you,
but we must help them.

425
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,458
PICARD:
Number One?

426
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,417
The creature attacked us.
Lieutenant Yar is down.

427
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:49,500
It seems to feed
on our phaser energy.
We had no effect on it.

428
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,792
PICARD:
What's Lieutenant Yar's
condition?

429
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:06,166
(<i> instrument beeping rapidly</i> )

430
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:08,458
Doctor Crusher, report.

431
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,667
She's dead.

432
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,625
I'm losing life signs.

433
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:19,250
You must save him.

434
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,291
I'm sorry.

435
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,542
PULASKI:
The growth rate has
definitely slowed.

436
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,583
What is he feeling?
Can you tell?

437
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:10,583
Sadness.

438
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:13,208
Just the opposite
of before.

439
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,291
And it's having the opposite
effect on the infection.

440
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,458
Then your theory
is correct.

441
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,250
The organisms are sensitive

442
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:23,250
to different types
of endorphins.

443
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:26,583
And negative emotions...
Such as sadness...

444
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:29,750
Produce endorphins that inhibit
the organism's growth.

445
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,458
Then we found a way
to repel the infection.

446
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,583
Assuming we're not too late,
already.

447
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,667
How much time do we have?

448
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,542
I'm not sure.

449
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,208
His vital signs
are getting weaker.

450
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,000
I don't want to risk
another dose

451
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,500
of tricordrazine
unless I have to.

452
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:48,667
I must refocus
the pattern again.

453
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:51,166
We need to isolate memories

454
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:54,166
that generate
stronger negative emotions.

455
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:09,500
I know I can count on every
Klingon warrior in this crew

456
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:12,083
to serve and die
in that battle.

457
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:15,000
So I ask you again,
Commander Riker,

458
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:17,417
where are your loyalties?

459
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:22,208
I've been assigned
to serve this ship

460
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,125
and to obey
your orders.

461
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,458
And I will do exactly that.

462
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,917
Will you take an oath
to that effect?

463
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:31,041
I just did.

464
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,125
This is your Second Officer,
Lieutenant Klag.

465
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:51,250
Was there something you wanted
to say to me, Lieutenant?

466
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:57,041
Yes, sir.

467
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,500
I do not believe you.

468
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:05,166
Then I take it you challenge
my authority over you.

469
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:08,458
Correct.

470
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,417
And your position on this,
Captain?

471
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:17,208
I would say it is
your first command decision.

472
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,166
(<i> growls softly</i> )

473
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:45,041
Ready for your
tour, Admiral?

474
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,000
Quite ready,
Commander.

475
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,333
What's in the case?

476
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,208
Actually, I brought it
for Dr. Crusher,

477
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,166
but perhaps you would like
to see it first.

478
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,458
What is it?
A form of life.

479
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,291
It was discovered
accidentally

480
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:02,458
by a survey team
on an uncharted planet.

481
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,208
Why haven't we heard
anything about that?

482
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,333
Oh, you'll be hearing
about it shortly,

483
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,834
but first, there remains much
scientific study to be done.

484
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:12,291
After all, it<i> is</i> 
a superior form of life.

485
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,375
Superior?
Totally.

486
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:16,458
Come, have a look.

487
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,583
I think I'll summon
my science officer.

488
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:21,291
It won't like
your science officer.

489
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,625
It<i> does</i> like you!

490
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,291
Vitamins--

491
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:28,250
they do wonders
for the body.

492
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:51,834
Riker to Security,
Guest Quarter 17. Emergency.

493
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:54,041
(<i> menacing chuckle</i> )

494
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:16,417
We've reduced the growth rate
even further, but not enough.

495
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:18,625
And his vital signs
are deteriorating.

496
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:22,250
But we've isolated
the specific areas to stimulate.

497
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,333
The feelings were primal,

498
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,667
survival emotions.

499
00:35:31,709 --> 00:35:34,542
They must be producing
a type of endorphin

500
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,417
that's poisonous
to the organisms.

501
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:39,333
Well, can't you intensify
that emotion?

502
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:44,917
I can refocus the impulse
pattern even tighter,

503
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:47,917
but I don't know if
he can withstand it.

504
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,333
He's extremely weak.

505
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,875
Do we have a choice?

506
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,917
No.

507
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:58,291
If we don't neutralize
the infection

508
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,625
within half an hour,

509
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,583
he'll be dead.

PULASKI:

Respiration shallow,

but we can't delay any longer.

517
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,917
You will take us to our planet
and leave us there

518
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:55,542
with our medicine
or this person dies.

519
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,834
Don't you see?
I have no choice.

520
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,875
We were sent to bring
the felicium back.

521
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,250
The suffering on my planet
is too great.

522
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:05,041
People are dying.

523
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,458
It doesn't matter whether
we're entitled to it or not.

524
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,875
We must have it.

525
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:10,125
Let him go.

526
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:12,375
You will take us
there now

527
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,166
or give us a shuttle,

528
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:16,750
but we must have
the medicine.

529
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:19,250
If you refuse,

530
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:21,458
this person will die.

531
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,542
I will not be coerced.

532
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,875
I will do it.

533
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:28,792
I will kill him.

534
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,083
Who are you?

535
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,458

537
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:56,250
<i>Touch him and he dies.</i>

538
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,166
No! No, don't!

539
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,291
<i>Enterprise.</i>

540
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:14,041
Armus has...
enveloped Commander Riker.

541
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,583
I'm beaming you up.

542
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:19,083
<i>If any of you leave now,</i>
<i>he dies.</i>

543
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:22,667
<i>And so do the survivors</i>
<i>of the crash.</i>

544
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:24,709
(<i> all gasp</i> )

545
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:45,959
The growth rate's down to 7%.

546
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,750
The organisms are still
impairing his neural functions.

547
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:52,375
Respiration is erratic,
pulse grossly irregular,

548
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:53,959
blood pressure almost nil.

549
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,083
Tricordrazine.

550
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,166
Can we tighten
the pattern further?

551
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:14,083
COMPUTER:
Recognize Picard,
Jean-Luc, Captain.

552
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:18,083
Recognize Riker,
William T., Commander.

553
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:21,333
Set auto-destruct sequence.

554
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:24,667
COMPUTER:
Does the First Officer concur?

555
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:28,375
Yes, set auto-destruct
sequence... now.

556
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,333
COMPUTER:
Auto-destruct will detonate

557
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:33,375
in four minutes
and 59 seconds.

558
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,917
I am Korris.

559
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,166
We'll handle the
formalities later.

560
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,542
Right now we have to
get off this ship.

561
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:44,375
Are there any
other survivors?

562
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:46,959
No.

563
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,208
I believe I have found
a quicker way out of here, sir.

564
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,333
Check him out.

565
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,917
He is alive, sir,
but just barely.

566
00:39:57,959 --> 00:40:00,333
Then pick up the body
and let's get out of here.

567
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:02,333
No!

568
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,291
I will carry him.

569
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,709
As you wish.

570
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,625
Come on, let's go!

571
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:12,834
Tasha, go to
Transporter Room 3.

572
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,625
I want you there
when the away team returns.

573
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,792
Aye, sir.

574
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:28,166
LA FORGE:
Commander, we are out of time!

575
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:31,166
This ship is blowing!

576
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,750
Transporter Room,
have you got a lock on us?

577
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,625
Too much interference.

578
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,667
You have to get farther away
from the engineering section.

579
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:39,583
Sir, the engineering
section is critical.

580
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:41,041
Destruction of the<i> Batris</i> 
is imminent.

581
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:44,083
They're out of options.
Do it now!

582
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,041
(<i> loud rumbling</i> )

583
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:07,166
(<i> explosion</i> )

584
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:21,208
The growth rate's
almost down to zero.

585
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,959
That's not good enough.

586
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,125
We seek peaceful coexistence.

587
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,291
Set auto-destruct...

588
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:49,125
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

589
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:52,000
Data, something's got me!

590
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,125
Auto-destruct...

591
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:58,959
...now.

592
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,750
Now.

593
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,500
Now.

594
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:10,542
<i>Data, something's got me!</i>

595
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:34,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

596
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:54,875
Sick Bay to Bridge.

597
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:56,875
PICARD:
Yes, Doctor.

598
00:42:56,917 --> 00:43:00,417
We've eradicated the infection.
I'm on my way.

599
00:43:20,917 --> 00:43:22,625
You're still here?

600
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:25,792
I could ask you
the same question.

601
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:28,291
How do you feel?

602
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:29,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

603
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,709
Beat.

604
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,166
You wouldn't believe
the dreams I was having.

605
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,709
Oh, yes, we would.

606
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,500
You'll be pleased to hear

607
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:41,041
that we've terminated
the infection.

608
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,917
Great work, Doctor.

609
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:46,333
Now, if I could
get out of here,

610
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,917
I'd like to get back to...
Lie still.

611
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,375
I still have a few
dozen tests to run.

612
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:53,291
Why?
I feel fine.

613
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,875
There may be some
residual memory loss.

614
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:59,125
I just want to be certain that
you still know who you are.

615
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,625
Of course I know who I am.

616
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:08,083
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

617
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:12,625
I'm delighted that you're
feeling better, Captain.

618
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:15,750
The Admiral and I
were worried about you.

619
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:17,667
Captain...

620
00:44:17,709 --> 00:44:19,291
I do not believe
you have the authority

621
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:21,417
to promote me
to the rank of Admiral.
