<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41997.7:</i>

2
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:07,542
<i>We are about to make</i>

3
00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:10,625
<i>a brief but necessary contact</i>
<i>with the Jarada</i>

4
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,542
<i>a reclusive, insect-like race</i>

5
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:15,875
<i>known for its idiosyncratic</i>
<i>attitude toward protocol.</i>

6
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,208
<i>The Jarada demand</i>
<i>a precise greeting</i>

7
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,625
<i>in this case</i>
<i>from Captain Picard.</i>

8
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,792
<i>Their language</i>
<i>is most unusual.</i>

9
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:26,375
<i>The slightest mispronunciation</i>
<i>is regarded as an insult.</i>

10
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,041
PICARD:
Unless it's
followed by...

11
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:33,667
The double bars indicate
an elongated "s" sound.

12
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:37,792
And the inverted "t" means
to hold the "z".

13
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:41,625
Unless?

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:45,000
Unless it's followed
by three wavy lines

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,083
in which case the "z"
becomes a "b."

16
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,291
Exactly.

17
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,875
What a language!

18
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,333
But you spell "knife"
with a "k."

19
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,000
I spell knife
with an "n."

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,458
But then I never
could spell.

21
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,875
Well, this is
an insect mind, sir.

22
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,291
My mind is barely working.

23
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,792
Take a break.

24
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:05,500
No, no, I want to go
over this again.

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,125
You could be over-preparing.

26
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,792
You've been looking forward

27
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:13,542
to the upgrade of the holodeck.

28
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:15,291
You have the time.

29
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,917
Captain, you need the diversion.

30
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,917
Dixon Hill.

31
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:29,458
The program's installed
and waiting.

32
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,417
Program desired location.

33
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:36,291
Earth, United States,
San Francisco, California.

34
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,542
Time period?

35
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:40,500
1941 AD.

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,583
File or access code?

37
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:46,792
File Dixon Hill,
private detective.

38
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:49,041
Enter when ready.

00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:52,542
<i>I'm entering</i>

00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,250
Very funny, Dix.

46
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,417
What did you do,
lose another bet?

47
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:29,375
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

48
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,709
The bellboy suit.

49
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you moonlighting

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,083
at the Fairmont?
The uniform?

51
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,375
It's totally inappropriate.

52
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,542
I should have changed.

53
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,917

your cop friend

00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,750
was here nosing around.

56
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,583
If he'd have seen you
in those threads

57
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,834
he'd have had you sent
to the funny farm.

58
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,458
Mr. Leech
called twice.

59
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,583
and there's a lady named
Bradley waiting in your office.

60
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,458
Nice legs.

61
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,750
Not you, her.

62
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,208
Got a hot date
with my fella.

63
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,917
See you in the morning.

64
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:27,959
I lost a bet.

65
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,583
Oh, well, at least you're
ready for Halloween.

66
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,291
Halloween?

67
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,041
I need your help, Mr. Hill.

68
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:51,291
Someone is trying to kill me.

<i>They seem real in every way.</i>

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,667
my husband,
my stepdaughter...

85
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:07,667
Or a lover, perhaps.

86
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,792
Perhaps.

87
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:13,166
Or perhaps
it's Cyrus Redblock.

88
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,291
I need you to find out.

89
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:23,041

$20.00 a day,
plus expenses.

91
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,417
Agreed.

92
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:34,834
I haven't said yes yet.

93
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,875
Oh, you'll say yes,
Mr. Hill.

94
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:49,542
If it is Redblock, he must think
I've got what he's looking for.

95
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:53,500
But believe me, I don't.

96
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,750
I'll take
your word for it.

97
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,542
Here's a C-note,
in advance.

98
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:04,375
Consider it a retainer.

99
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:09,458
And next time, wear a suit.

100
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,375
<i>Au revoir.</i>

101
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,875
(<i> horn honking outside</i> )

102
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,208
Remarkable!

103
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,166
Exit.

104
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,709
(<i> knocking</i> )

105
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:18,875
You'll have
to call again.

106
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,041
I'm just leaving.

107
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,542
I'm not dressed properly.

108
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:23,875
I'll be back.

109
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,125
Mr. Hill?

110
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,166
Where are you?

111
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,333
Memory, save current setting.

112
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,166
Current setting saved.

113
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,875
Holodeck off.

114
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:05,917
And when I looked down
into the street

115
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:11,750
I actually saw automobiles.

116
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,500
Otto-moveels?
Mm-hmm.

117
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,875
An ancient
Earth device

118
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,959
used primarily
for transportation.
Ah.

119
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,208
Also seen as a source
of status and virility.

120
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,792
Often a prime ingredient
in teenage mating rituals.

121
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:28,208
Teenage mating rituals?

122
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:32,208
From that window, I
could see an entire...

123
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,375
City block?

124
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,500
That's right.

125
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,083
Sounds, smells...

126
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,834
You make it sound so real.

127
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,500
That's how it felt.

128
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,709
Incredible.

129
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,583
Hmm?

130
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,834
Oh.

131
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:49,917
Well, I'm going
to go again.

132
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:52,792
Only this time, I'm going
to dress the part.

133
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,792
Why not come with me?

134
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,667
Yes, I'd like that.

135
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:02,083
I want to take that
20th century historian...

136
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,375
Who, Whalen?
Yes, Whalen.

137
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,375
I bet he knows more
about Dixon Hill than I do.

138
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,959
Shall I
tell him, sir?

139
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,750
Invite him, Mr. Data.

140
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,208
This is supposed to be
a recreational activity.

141
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:19,417
The sense of reality
was absolutely incredible.

142
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,083
When that woman kissed me

143
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,000
it was so...
Exciting?

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,667
Real.

145
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,041
The purpose of this meeting

146
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:32,083
is to discuss
the Jaradan rendezvous.

147
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,542
Mr. Riker, will you go ahead
with the briefing?

148
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:37,709
This is primarily
a diplomatic mission.

149
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:40,792
The Jaradan are strategically
important to the federation.

150
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:42,208
Previous attempts have failed

151
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,291
because they are
so easily irritated.

152
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,083
A slip in the pronunciation
of the greeting

153
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,667
caused a 20-year rift.

154
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,917
The Captain has to recite
the entire greeting

155
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,458
without making any mistakes.

156
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,458
Simple as that, huh?

157
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,709
DATA:
Yes.

158
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,083
If, on the other hand,
the Captain makes

159
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,250
even the
slightest
error...

160
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,041
The Captain
is well aware

161
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,375
of the gravity
of the situation, Commander.

162
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,417
We are all aware of the tape
of the last Federation starship

163
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,458
to come into contact
with the Jaradan.

164
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,291
It graphically
demonstrates

165
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,125
what happened when that
Captain offended them.

166
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,083
Captain Picard
is familiar with
that, Data.

167
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,834
Should we not rerun it?

168
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,250
It's not necessary, Mr. Data.

169
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,875
Meeting adjourned.

170
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,333
Why would the Captain
not want to review

171
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,834
all available information
on the subject?

172
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:31,166
Data, when you've seen
the Jaradan react once

173
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,667
you don't ever need
to see it again.

174
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:37,375
This Dixon Hill is
a most puzzling character.

175
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,917
Not really.

176
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:41,458
He was just a 20th century
Sherlock Holmes.

177
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,792
Ah, but was his
<i>modus operandi</i>
not dissimilar?

178
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:46,458
Worth investigating.

179
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,458
Indubitably, my dear Data.

180
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,166
Indubitably.

181
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:59,709

<i>The Jaradan rendezvous</i>

193

<i>I am about to reenter</i>

194
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,000

199
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,959
Ready for San Francisco,
Mr. Whalen?

200
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,458
More than ready, sir.

201
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,709
Well, if it's anything
like last time

202
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:03,125
I'm sure you won't
be disappointed.

203
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,125
Permission to accompany you,
sir.

204
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,500
I am totally versed
in the genre of the period.

205
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,417
Well, shall we?

206
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,291
(<i> horns honking</i> )

207
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:08,458
Hey, Dix, how's Tricks?

208
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,959
Hmm? Oh, she's fine, fine.

209
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:17,375
Wonderful. He actually
thinks you're Dixon Hill.

210
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,166
Say, Mack, I would like
to buy a newspaper, too

211
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,709
but I don't have
any money.

212
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,500
Hey, you catch me next time,
huh, Dix?

213
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,417
Thank you,
thank you.

214
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,959
"Hitler
on the move.

215
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,083
"Roosevelt presses
Congress for British aid.

216
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,750
(<i> mispronounces</i> ):
DiMaggio streak
reaches 37."

217
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,375
DiMaggio, sir.

218
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,500
Jolting Joe,
the Yankee Clipper.

219
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,208
Baseball, sir.

220
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,500
It was a national
obsession at the time.

221
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,375
The streak they are referring to
will eventually reach 56 games

222
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,041
and be
snapped

223
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,667
by a pair of journeyman hurlers
for the Cleveland Indians.

224
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,250
Cleveland?

225
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,834
They got no pitchers,
they never got no pitchers.

226
00:14:58,834 --> 00:14:59,959
What are you, nuts or something?

227
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,208
The record
will stand

228
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,000
until the year 2026

229
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,834
when a shortstop
for the London Kings...

230
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:08,792
Hey, Dix, what gives
with this guy?

231
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,625
He's not from around here,
is he?

232
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,709
No, he's not.

233
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:13,333
He's...

234
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,500
he's from...

235
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,959
South America.

236
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,709
Yeah, he's got a nice tan.

237
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,208
I should have
listened to her.

238
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,917
She told me someone
was trying to kill her.

239
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:39,625
Captain, she's a page
from a book.

240
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,458
That's all she ever was.

241
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,375
Well, well.

242
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,208
Look what the cat
dragged in.

243
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:52,208
Cat?

244
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,250
Where the hell did he come from?

245
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,875
South America.
Can't you tell?

246
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,250
Wherever you're from

247
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,834
while you're in my town
you keep your nose clean.

248
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,583
Well,
tough guy

249
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,583
this time you've really done it.

250
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,208
Your goose is
cooked, but good.

251
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,625
I'm sorry
about this, Dix.

252
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,417
Don't apologize
to him.

253
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:16,917
Where were you last night
between 10:00 and midnight?

254
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:19,041
That would be a bit hard
to explain.

255
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,417
Yeah? Well, you'll have
plenty of time

256
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,208
to come up with something.

257
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,834
You're going downtown.

258
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,208
For what?

259
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,750
For the murder
of Jessica Bradley.

260
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,208
We found this

261
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,709
in her purse.

262
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,417
Status report.

263
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:56,458
We're being probed, sir.

264
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,458
The Jarada.

265
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,500
Most likely.

266
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,875
But it's
long range.

267
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,291
Can't be certain
where it's originating.

268
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:20,375
One could get the feeling
they don't exactly trust us.

269
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,333
Commander, I'm receiving
a subspace message

270
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,125
from the Jarada.

271
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,417
That's not part
of the plan.

272
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,041
Pipe it through.

273
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:31,083
<i>Enterprise,</i> we speak to you
in your language.

274
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,333
The time has come
for you to honor us in<i> ours.</i>

275
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:37,166
This is Commander Riker,
First Officer of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

276
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:41,208
You are not Captain?

277
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,417
No, sir, I'm not.

278
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:46,458
I suggest we commence
screen-to-screen communication

279
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,792
so we can see each other.

280
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,959
You offend us.

281
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:53,000
We will not show ourselves
to a mere subordinate.

282
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,458
We await your Captain's greeting
with growing unrest.

283
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,417
End of communication.

284
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,792
Terrific.

285
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,166
Find the Captain.

286
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,166
He's in the holodeck.

287
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,250
Aye, sir.

288
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,458
Enter when ready.

289
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,458
...when ready.

290
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,291
...when ready.

291
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:56,250
Hiya, Doc.

292
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,041
What's cooking?

293
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,458
You know I had some trouble
getting through?

294
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,250
Where's
Captain Picard?

295
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,875
He's on ice.

296
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,000
Pardon?

297
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,542
He's being grilled.

298
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,417
What is he, a fish?

299
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,959
He's being interrogated.

300
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,834
They think
he committed a murder.

301
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:18,000
Why aren't we all
being interrogated?

302
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,291
Maybe I should go and help him.

303
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,959
No, no, no, relax.
Relax, doc.

304
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,834
He's having the time
of his life in there.

305
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:27,709
Well, why should he have
all the fun?

306
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,709
Come on, Toots,
let's go.

307
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,000
Spill it.

308
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,375
I've told you
everything I know.

309
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,125
Well, you'll just have
to tell us again.

310
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,750
From the top.

311
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,458
From the top!

312
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,500
Oh, very good.

313
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,208
I've read all
this before, you know.

314
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,458
It's absolutely
as it should be.

315
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,792
La Forge to Bridge.

316
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,125
Riker here.

317
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,709
I can't find the Captain, sir.

318
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:22,542
I told you,
he's in the holodeck.

319
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,333
I'm at the holodeck.

320
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,542
Something's gone wrong.

321
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,125
What are you saying, Lieutenant?

322
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,542
I can't communicate with them.

323
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,041
I can't access the program

324
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,917
and I can't open the doors.

325
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:45,542
Enterprise<i> Log, Supplemental,</i>
<i>First Officer reporting:</i>

326
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,375
<i>Due to a breakdown</i>
<i>in the holodeck</i>

327
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,917
<i>we are unable to contact</i>
<i>the Captain.</i>

328
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,959
Tasha, take over.

329
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,583
I'm going to holodeck 3.

330
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,125
WESLEY:
Commander.

331
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:00,458
I've studied all the technical
manuals on the holodeck, sir.

332
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,625
I think I can be
of some help down there.

333
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,041
Geordi's well equipped
to deal with the situation, Wes.

334
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,667
Right now your duty's here
on the Bridge.

335
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:11,458
Will, his mother's
missing, too.

336
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,750
Come on, Wesley.

337
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,041
And you say you
never met her

338
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,750
before she came
to hire you.

339
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,125
I've already told you
that, twice.

340
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,417
Yeah? Well, you're going
to have to tell me again.

341
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:35,166
Look, fellows, this
is no longer amusing.

342
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,959
Easy, Dan.

343
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,834
You think you're
tough, Hill

344
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:40,583
but you're nothing!

345
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,333
Don't take him
too seriously, Dix.

346
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,250
His old lady's been
giving him a hard time.

347
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,500
You know how it is.

348
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,667
Actually, I do need
to get out of here.

349
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:58,041
I'll see
what I can do.

350
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:25,709
(<i> clears throat</i> )

351
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:27,500
Something on your mind?

352
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,208
Yeah, but
I'm not sure

353
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,834
it can be repeated
in mixed company.

354
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,834
You're a pretty
hep-looking broad.

355
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:45,500
Is that good?

356
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,083
It ain't bad.

357
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,375
You like
Tommy Dorsey?

358
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,500
I got two tickets

359
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,792
for the dance
tomorrow night.

360
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,709
Have you tried the intercom?

361
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:06,834
GEORDI:
Yes.

362
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:08,917
Riker to holodeck.

363
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:11,458
Riker to holodeck.

364
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,375
Are you seeing anything?

365
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,375
No, sir.

366
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,250
RIKER:
What can I do?

367
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,709
GEORDI:
Not a thing.

368
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:28,709
We have to go
through this

369
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:29,834
millimeter
by millimeter.

370
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:33,125
All right,
get it fixed.

371
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,250
Easy, Wes,
slow it down.

372
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,333
If there's
an anomaly

373
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,000
you could go right
past it, okay?

374
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:47,583
I've known the guy
for ten years.

375
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,041
Okay, Dix, we're
cutting you loose.

376
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,667
That's
welcome news.

377
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:58,125
You better not try
to leave town.

378
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:03,250
If I leave town,
the town leaves with me.

379
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,792
I get the feeling your friend
doesn't like me.

380
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:07,750
We know you're dealing
with Redblock, Dixon.

381
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,291
Take it
from a friend.

382
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,750
It doesn't
help your case.

383
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,291
Redblock?

384
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,125
I'll keep it in mind.

385
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,417
Thank you
for helping me.

386
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:16,458
Forget it.

387
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:26,667
(<i> coughs</i> )

388
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:30,625
Say, Dix, when you
coming over for supper?

389
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,542
The kids would
love to see you.

390
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:34,375
And you know how much you
love Sharon's cooking.

391
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,250
Soon, my friend.

392
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,041
For the moment,
I have other duties.

393
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,583
Blonde or
brunette?

394
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,583
She's a lady,
all right.

395
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,000
And her name
is<i> Enterprise.</i>

396
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,917
Sounds like a working
girl to me.

397
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:51,208
Hey, I'll stop by the office
with a bottle of scotch.

398
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,542
You can tell me all about her.

399
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:15,000
Have a good time?

400
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,291
I don't know.

401
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:20,083
Sometimes it almost
seemed too real.

402
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,792
I must say,
you wear it well.

403
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:25,959
I'm glad you
could make it.

404
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,291
Why, thank you,
Mr. Hill.

405
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:33,458
Maybe we should
be getting back

406
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:34,417
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

407
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,333
We are
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

408
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:40,083
Oh, yes, of course.
So we are.

409
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,792
Do we have time
to see your office?

410
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:47,750
Mmm. Yes, of course.
Why not?

411
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,583
Captain, mind
if I join you?

412
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,333
Yeah, me too,
boss.

413
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,041
I'd love
to take a gander.

414
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:05,750
The holodeck makes excellent use
of finite space.

415
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:13,333
Oh, Mr. Hill, you have
been avoiding me.

416
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,083
It's Felix Leech.

417
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,083
It has to be.

418
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,333
You know me, sir?

419
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,208
Well, I've read about you,
many times.

420
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:24,500
I'm very sorry, Mr. Leech,
but we have to be going.

421
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,709
Call again tomorrow.

422
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:29,250
You're being quite rude,
Mr. Hill.

423
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,000
You haven't even introduced me
to your charming companions.

424
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,208
That'll have
to wait.

425
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:36,917
But we have business.

426
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:39,542
Urgent business.

427
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:44,542
You're not
going anywhere.

428
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:48,625
Not until we have
a little chat.

429
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:50,041
YAR:
Bridge to holodeck.

430
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,625
We're approaching
the Jaradan sector.

431
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,417
RIKER:
Any word
from the Jaradans?

432
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:55,208
Not a thing, sir.

433
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:56,542
They may be testing us--

434
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,667
seeing if we'll stick
to the arrangements.

435
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:01,458
What do we do now, sir?

436
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:02,500
We wait.

437
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,834
Well, everything checks
out so far.

438
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,417
Ensign Crusher believes
the trouble

439
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,458
may have been caused
by the Jaradan probe.

440
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:14,125
If so, it could be
very difficult to locate.

441
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:19,291
I am not a man
to be toyed with, Mr. Hill.

442
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:21,375
You were hired to locate

443
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,083
a certain
object.

444
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:26,750
I demand to know
what you have
done with it.

445
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:32,000
Well, I suppose
a few moments longer...

446
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,333
I'm afraid I can't
help you, Mr. Leech.

447
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:38,166
The game
is over.

448
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:41,959
I assure you,
this is not a game.

449
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,875
Take it from me, Leech.

450
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,875
You'll never find it.

451
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,583
Now give me the gun.

452
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,208
(<i> gunshot</i> )

453
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,375
But they're not real.

454
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,208
There's massive internal
bleeding.

455
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,875
We have to get him
to sick bay.

456
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,208
How could
this happen?

457
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,959
It will happen again
if you don't cooperate.

458
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:21,917
Ooh!

459
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,125
You struck me.

460
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,375
How dare
you?

461
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,959
You're going
to be sorry.

462
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,208
I promise
you.

463
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,333
Redblock isn't going
to like this!

464
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,041
If we don't
get him to sick bay,

465
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,917
he will die.

466
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:36,917
Exit.

467
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:38,333
Computer, exit!

468
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:47,208
Data, try the other
exit in the hall.

469
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:55,417
Computer, identify exit.

470
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,834
There's a programming
malfunction.

471
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:06,041
The computer refuses
to identify the exits.

472
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:09,500
I'm losing his pulse.

473
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,458
Computer, this
is the Captain!

474
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:16,000
Computer,
identify exit!

475
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:23,917
Standard orbit,
Mr. Worf.

476
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:25,834
Aye, sir.
Standard orbit.

477
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,041
Riker to holodeck.

478
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,667
Nothing yet, Commander.

479
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,417
We're running out of time.

480
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:35,500
The Jarada will expect
the Captain's greeting.

481
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,792
Well, you may have
to stall them.

482
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:46,959
It's no use.
It's just not there.

483
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,583
Suggestions,
Mr. Data.

484
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:51,625
I'm at
a loss, sir.

485
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:55,500
We're in a holodeck-created
building of 1941.

486
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,125
The computer refuses
to accept voice commands.

487
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:04,000
The controls for the environment
are therefore not accessible.

488
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,667
I could use some light.

489
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,542
(<i> door opens</i> )

490
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:38,792
Good day, Mr. Hill.

491
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:41,250
My name is Cyrus Redblock.

492
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,875
I hope you don't mind us
dropping in.

493
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,500
I see I have no choice.

494
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,333
Life is an endless stream
of choices.

495
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,083
Unfortunately,
you have chosen

496
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,083
to make my life
more difficult.

497
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,959
I don't suppose you'd be
foolish enough

498
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,041
to hide it here?

499
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:04,417
I don't suppose so.

500
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:07,125
Still, I'm sure

501
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,000
you won't mind
if we take a look around?

502
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,667
I wish you'd quit asking,
since it's obvious

503
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:11,792
you're going to do it
anyway.

504
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:13,500
It's just
a waste of time.

505
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,542
Good manners, madam, are never
a waste of time.

506
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,834
Civility, gentleman.

507
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,792
Always civility.

508
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:24,208
Get that stiff
out of here.

509
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:25,792
He's not dead.

510
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:28,500
From his pallor,
he soon will be.

511
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,333
You want I should throw him
in the garbage, boss?

512
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:35,458
The room next door will be
good enough for now.

513
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:37,875
Don't touch him.

514
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,375
Which one struck you?

515
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,709
It was Hill.

516
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,542
For every action
there is an equal

517
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,583
and opposite reaction.

518
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:05,750
A Newtonian truism which
you have obviously neglected.

519
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,375
McNARY:
Dix, you
in there?

520
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:17,792
I saw your light

521
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,625
and figured you were
working late.

522
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,333
Guess I was right.

523
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,750
Nice company you're
keeping, Dix.

524
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,375
You forget to take
the trash out this morning?

525
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,625
I'm a tolerant man

526
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:36,542
but I do not tolerate
disrespect.

527
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:39,333
Your devotion to etiquette
is highly admirable, sir.

528
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:42,250
However, your methods
leave much to be desired.

529
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:47,041
What have we here?

530
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,500
LEECH:
He looks
like a ghost.

531
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,542
Yeah.

532
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:53,709
Where do you
suppose he's from?

533
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:56,500
Where were you
hatched, anyway?

534
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,208
I was created on a planet...

535
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,166
Data.

536
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,166
South America.

537
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,250
REDBLOCK:
I've been
all over the world.

538
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,000
I've never seen
anything like you.

539
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,417
He's not from this world.

540
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,834
None of us are.

541
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:15,709
We are from a world...

542
00:33:15,709 --> 00:33:19,166
we're from a world
of fabulous riches.

543
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:23,083
A world where there are objects
far greater

544
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,917
than the one you seek.

545
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,500
That's ridiculous.

546
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,375
You're a private dick.

547
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,667
We've met before

548
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,917
and you never even mentioned
any of this.

549
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:33,625
He's right,
Dix.

550
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,250
That's pretty weak stuff.

551
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,166
I wouldn't even buy
that line of guff.

552
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:39,625
I am not Dixon Hill.

553
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,917
I just look like Dixon Hill.

554
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:44,125
DATA:
He speaks the truth, sir.

555
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,375
From your point
of view

556
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:48,417
he is only a facsimile.

557
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:49,792
A knock-off.

558
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:50,792
A cheap imitation.

559
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,542
<i>Thank you,</i> Mr. Data.

560
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:54,750
Sorry, sir, that
did not come out

561
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,500
quite the way
I intended.

562
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,417
REDBLOCK:
Very, very good.

563
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:00,792
What wonderful
fiction.

564
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,583
Quite entertaining.

565
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,000
I admire
your skill

566
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,834
at trying to obfuscate
our sense of reality.

567
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,542
It is you who
are not real, sir.

568
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:09,709
CRUSHER:
Data...

569
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,625
It's you who are
imaginary characters

570
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:13,291
derived from a
work of fiction.

571
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:15,250
Give it up,
fellas.

572
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,750
These guys are
too smart

573
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,291
to fall for that
kind of story.

574
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:21,083
I am afraid you are not
real either, Lieutenant.

575
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,417
LEECH:
I don't want to hear
any more of this.

576
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:26,750
You're making me crazy.

577
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,542
Let me shoot them, Mr. Redblock.

578
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,417
Let me kill them

579
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:32,959
one by one.

580
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:37,625
What an interesting situation.

581
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,917
Perhaps we should test
this theory

582
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:41,917
by killing
one of them.

583
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:43,250
You've already done that.

584
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,500
This man is dying.

585
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,959
It's all so senseless.

586
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,458
Oh, hardly.

587
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:50,625
Senseless killing is immoral,

588
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:55,500
but killing for a purpose
can be quite often ingenious.

589
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,959
Well said, Mr. Redblock.

590
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:02,208
What is our purpose?

591
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:06,417
We are on a quest
for knowledge, Mr. Leech.

592
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:09,083
We want the item!

593
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,375
We don't have it.

594
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,291
Shall I kill him?

595
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,208
No.

596
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,667
Kill the woman.

597
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,625
Redblock.

598
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,458
I have the item.

599
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:41,333
At last.

600
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,542
I knew it.

601
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:46,125
God, man, what a
character you are.

602
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,500
Waiting till
the last moment.

603
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,834
Testing my resolve.

604
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:53,417
All right.
Where is it?

605
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,458
I'll explain.

606
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,333
But first tell Leech
to back off.

607
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,834
Put the gun down, Mr. Leech.

608
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:06,083
But I so much
want to kill her.

609
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,333
Maybe later.

610
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,458
It won't harm us
to listen to Mr. Hill.

611
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:13,875
Don't make
any deals

612
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,000
with that slime, Dix.

613
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:24,166
All right,
let's begin.

614
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:28,333
Make your thoughts fruitful

615
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,917
and your words eloquent,

616
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:33,417
'cause I don't
have to tell you,

617
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:36,625
your lovely lady friend's life
depends upon it.

618
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:41,542
There is a price.

619
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:44,750
By god, I knew you were
a man of my stripe.

620
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,417
All right.
What is it?

621
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:48,208
Mr. Whalen's life.

622
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,166
You must help us to save him.

623
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:57,750
We can't delay
much longer.

624
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,458
We're going to have
to tell them something.

625
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,041
Open hailing frequencies.

626
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:02,500
Frequencies open, sir.

627
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
This is Commander Riker
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

628
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,458
We demand that you...

629
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:06,917
(<i> loud buzzing</i> )

630
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:08,959
Cut that off.

631
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,083
They're not going
to be satisfied

632
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,959
with anyone less
than the Captain.

633
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,375
La Forge to Bridge.

634
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,583
Riker here.

635
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:20,959
We think we have something, sir.

636
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:22,667
I'll let Ensign Crusher explain.

637
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,083
The bi-converter interface
has been affect...

638
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,083
Forget the explanation!

639
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:27,208
Can you do it?

640
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,709
I don't know if I should, sir.

641
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:34,709
If this isn't done correctly
the program could abort

642
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:37,250
and everyone inside
could vanish.

643
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,500
Do you need more time
to study it?

644
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,917
Whether we do it now or later,
the risk is the same.

645
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:46,166
Do it.

646
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,792
If we can find a way of getting
him to our sick bay

647
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:57,041
by fixing our computer...

648
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,750
Computer?

649
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,583
I don't know that word.

650
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:03,041
An electronic
or mechanical apparatus

651
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:05,000
capable of carrying out
repetitious

652
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,250
or complex mathematical
operations at high speed.

653
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,959
Computers
are used to control,

654
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:11,917
process, perform,
or store...

655
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:14,333
Enough!
Let me kill him.

656
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,875
He's really beginning
to irritate me.

657
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:24,417
(overlapping shouting)

658
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,709
(overlapping exclamations)

659
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:32,834
Captain--

660
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:34,500
the exit.

661
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,959
That's it.

662
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:38,000
That's the way
into our world.

663
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,917
Remarkable.

664
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:48,208
Is this a two-way passage?

665
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:50,375
Can one enter your world

666
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,959
and return
to this one

667
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:53,667
simply by
stepping
through?

668
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,458
Oh, yes.

669
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,667
Allow us to help
Mr. Whalen

670
00:38:57,667 --> 00:39:00,125
and we will return with...

671
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,625
the item.

672
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,959
You really are
a scamp, aren't you?

673
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:08,000
Do you actually think
I'd stay here and...

674
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,208
If you were going to go
through yourself, sir

675
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:12,792
that is not possible.

676
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:14,166
One look
at you, sir

677
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:19,125
is proof that anything
is possible.

678
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,125
Step aside, Mr. Hill.

679
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,000
I'd shoot
you myself

680
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,333
but I don't want to deprive
my assistant

681
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:26,667
of his greatest pleasure.

682
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,125
After we're gone

683
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,625
kill them all.

684
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,458
Make sure the bodies
are never found.

685
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:34,291
You're insane.

686
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,875
You think you can kill
a cop and get away with it?

687
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:41,375
Why not?
I've done it before.

688
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,875
Come on, Mr. Leech.

689
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:47,375
<i>Au revoir</i>

690
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:50,000
<i>et bon chance, mon ami.</i>

691
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,959
Our destiny awaits.

692
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,959
Another world.

693
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:03,291
A whole new world
to plunder.

694
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:07,834
What is this?

695
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:10,000
What are they doing?

696
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,125
They can't
do this to me!

697
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:14,083
Don't they know
who I am?

698
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,250
I'm Cyrus Redblock!

699
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,291
Cyrus Redblock!

700
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:37,000
With your permission, sir?

701
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,083
Permission granted.

702
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:49,417
Data, pick up Whalen.
Take him to sick bay.

703
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:50,750
And you, sir?

704
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,500
I'll follow.
You go now.

705
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:35,291
I wish I could
take you with me.

706
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:41,041
Someone has
to book this creep.

707
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,875
Once a cop,
always a cop, I guess.

708
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,917
I have to go.

709
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:52,125
So...

710
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,709
this is the big good-bye.

711
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,709
Tell me
something, Dix.

712
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:11,750
When you're gone
will this world still exist?

713
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:19,625
Will my wife and kids still be
waiting for me at home?

714
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,333
I honestly don't know.

715
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:38,125
Good-bye, my friend.

716
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,709
Captain.

717
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:56,917
RIKER:
You ready, sir?

718
00:42:56,917 --> 00:43:00,125
Ready as I'll ever be,
Number One.

719
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,709
Open hailing frequencies.

720
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:03,333
Frequencies
open, sir.

721
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:09,375
This is Jean-Luc Picard,
Captain of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

722
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:14,709
(<i> Jaradan greeting</i> )

723
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:40,542
You have honored us

724
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:42,458
with your words of greeting.

725
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:44,083
A new day dawns

726
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:45,583
between us.

727
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,583
(cheers and applause)

728
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,000
So...
have a nice vacation?

729
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,875
It was a nice place
to visit, Number One

730
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:01,959
but I wouldn't want
to die there.

731
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:05,291
So, Data,
how was it?

732
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:10,959
It was raining in
the City by the Bay--

733
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:12,917
a hard rain.

734
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:14,959
Hard enough
to wash the slime...

735
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:16,125
Data!

736
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:18,125
Sorry, sir.

737
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,750
Lieutenant, take us
out of orbit.

738
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:21,875
Aye, sir.

739
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:23,709
And Mr. La Forge...
Sir?

740
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:28,625
Step on it.
