1
00:00:02,792 --> 00:00:04,000
You're absolutely right,
Doctor.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,625
Right now...

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:08,750
I can't imagine
ever hurting anybody.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,625
DOCTOR:
How do you feel

5
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,417
about that person
you used to be?

6
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,458
I feel terrible,

7
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,625
but thanks to you,
I'm... I'm doing much better now

8
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:24,041
and I'm... confident
that when I leave

9
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:28,291
I will be ready
to take my place in society.

10
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,709
And when do you think
that will be?

11
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:32,083
Well, now.

12
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,667
Right away.

13
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,333
Why do you say that?

14
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,375
Well, you said
that when I was able to...

15
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,542
accept what I'd done

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,000
and I understood
the consequences of my actions

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,375
that I would be...
I would be free to go.

18
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,417
"Free to go."

19
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,875
You mean
you don't think

20
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,417
you should stand trial
for what you did.

21
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:56,625
No, I'm looking forward
to proving my innocence.

22
00:00:56,625 --> 00:01:00,458
I thought you said
you accepted what you did.

23
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:03,041
No.

24
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,000
That's-that's not
what I meant.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,917
(<i> Riker sighs</i> )

26
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:10,166
I was sick when it happened.

27
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,291
I wasn't responsible
for what I did.

28
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,166
How do I know you're
not just telling me

29
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,208
what I want to hear?

30
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:21,000
Perhaps we should continue
this discussion next week.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,250
No. I-I want to talk
about this<i> now.</i>

32
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,834
You're starting
to sound angry again.

33
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:28,375
Maybe you need
another treatment.

34
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,583
What I need is to get
out of this cell.

35
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,417
I've been locked
in here for... for days.

36
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:34,834
You've controlled
my every move.

37
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:36,583
You've told... you've told me
what to eat and what to think

38
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,166
and what to say, and then...

39
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:41,792
when I show a glimmer
of independent thought

40
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:44,667
you strap me down,
you inject me with drugs.

41
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:45,959
You call it a "treatment."

42
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,375
You're becoming
agitated.

43
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,000
You bet I'm agitated.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,750
I may be surrounded
by insanity,

45
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,750
but I'm not insane

46
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,875
and there's any...
there isn't...

47
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,458
there's nothing you...

48
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,542
(<i> laughs softly</i> )

49
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:02,291
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,917
Could-could we go back to, uh...

51
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:06,000
to "you're
becoming agitated"?

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,750
No. Why don't we take
a break for tonight?

53
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,083
I think we've made
a lot of progress.

54
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,667
I'm still not comfortable
with that last speech.

55
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,041
There's such a thing
as over-rehearsing, Will.

56
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,583
You're going to be fine.

57
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,792
I don't know.

58
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,583
Maybe I'm just not right
for this part.

59
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,625
Most humanoids
have the potential
to be irrational.

60
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,000
Perhaps you
should attempt

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,750
to access that part
of your psyche.

62
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,792
Thank you, Data.

63
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,625
Your character feels
at odds with everyone--

64
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,959
as if the world's
against him.

65
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,750
Like my first year
at the Academy.

66
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,333
Yes. That's what your
<i>character</i> is going through

67
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:42,125
but I want<i> you,</i> 
Will Riker, to relax.

68
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,917
I'll do my best.

69
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,041
It'll be wonderful.

70
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,417
You're going to knock 'em dead.

71
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:47,834
Right.

72
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,750
(<i> door opens</i> )

73
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,709
You control my every move.

74
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,333
You tell me what to say,
what to think,

75
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:03,333
what to eat, what to<i> say</i> 
what to think, what to eat.

76
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:07,667
And then when I show a<i> glimmer</i>
of independent thought

77
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,166
you strap me down,
inject me with drugs

78
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,417
call it a "treatment."

79
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:15,125
I may be surrounded by insanity,
but I am not insane.

80
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,792
Excuse me.

81
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:02,667
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

82
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:06,500
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

83
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

84
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,458
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

85
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:17,041
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

86
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:20,458
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

87
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,625
Tilonus IV?

88
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,834
Didn't their government
just collapse?

89
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,917
It's in a state
of total anarchy.

90
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:25,125
When the prime minister
was assassinated

91
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,500
a Federation research team
was on the planet.

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,709
It's believed that they
were forced into hiding.

93
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:33,709
Will, your mission will be to
locate and to evacuate them.

94
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,041
Can't they go
to the local authorities?

95
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,375
There are no
local authorities.

96
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,083
The government is splintered.

97
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,583
It seems that... there are
various factions vying for power

98
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,959
and they're desperate

99
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,166
for weapons
or technology of any kind.

100
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:50,834
Apparently, some of the factions
have resorted to torture

101
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,709
to gather
their information.

102
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:56,125
Well, a Starfleet research team
would be a prime target.

103
00:05:56,125 --> 00:06:00,041
Then I'll have to go
down there alone, undercover.

104
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,875
Agreed.

105
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,208
Mr. Worf is ready to give you
a detailed briefing

106
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,750
on Tilonian culture.

107
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,125
Well, I guess
I'll have to back out

108
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,750
of Beverly's play after all.

109
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,041
Oh, no. No, there will be
plenty of time for that.

110
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,709
We don't arrive at Tilonus
for another five days.

111
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,792
And besides,
if you back out

112
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,875
she'll come after me
to play the part.

113
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:30,709
This is the last
known location

114
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,250
of the research team.

115
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,792
They had occupied
a small building

116
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,458
in the southwest
quarter of the city.

117
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,291
You will begin
your search there.

118
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,625
The southwest quarter is
over 200 square kilometers.

119
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,583
That's a lot of land
for one man to cover.

120
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,667
I guess I'd better pack
an extra pair of boots.

121
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,458
This apparel will help you
pass as a common merchant.

122
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,792
This Tilonian pendant

123
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,291
is equipped with
a communicator circuit.

124
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,625
Hmm... doesn't really
match the outfit.

125
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,583
I suggest you pay closer
attention, Commander.

126
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,583
Your life will
be at stake.

127
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,500
Do you understand
what I am saying?

128
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,959
Of course I do.

129
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,000
Because you will be
posing as a merchant

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,542
you will need to know
how to use the<i> nisroh</i>

131
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:14,875
for the traditional
bartering ceremony.

132
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,625
You will be judged on your
prowess with the blade.

133
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,458
I-I'm sorry, Commander.
I did not intend...

134
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,792
It's okay.

135
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:30,500
I guess I really wasn't
paying attention.

136
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,959
I'd better go to Sick Bay.

137
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,125
We'll continue this later.

138
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,333
Boy, you will do anything

139
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,041
to get out of
doing this play

140
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,917
but you're going to
have to do something
better than this.

141
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,291
The play's not
till tomorrow night.

142
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,458
I've still got 24 hours.

143
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,792
(<i> regenerator whirring</i> )

144
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,333
Well, don't get any ideas.

145
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,083
I will see you onstage
at 1800 hours.

146
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,083
Right.

147
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,959
Oh... it still hurts.

148
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,959
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

149
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,792
There was no damage
to the nerves,

150
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,750
so you shouldn't
be feeling any pain.

151
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,041
Probably just a symptom
of stage fright.

152
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,667
CREWMAN:
Oh! It hurts! Oh!

153
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,834
He was working on
a conduit on deck 39.

154
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:15,041
A plasma torch blew
up in his hands.

155
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,083
Oh, it hurts. Please!

156
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,875
Hypospray.
Yes, Doctor.

157
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,250
(<i> groaning</i> )

158
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,041
CRUSHER:
Get me 20cc's of leporazine.

159
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,959
Treat the
surface burns

160
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,166
with the anabolic proto-plaser.

161
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,709
Yes, Doctor.

162
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:27,041
WOMAN:
Should we get a stasis unit
on line?

163
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,208
CRUSHER:
Have one standing by
just in case

164
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,458
and get me an epidermal
sample right away.

165
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,250
Begin dermal regeneration

166
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,917
and have tissue regrowth
standing by.

167
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,959
I want him sedated.

168
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,875
I've been on
a lot of missions.

169
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,709
I've seen a lot
of people injured,

170
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:43,250
but I have never
been affected by
anything like this.

171
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,917
He was looking right at me.

172
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:47,083
And that was
disturbing to you.

173
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,083
It was as if he was
blaming me for something.

174
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,875
And this wasn't
the only incident.

175
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,667
The last several days

176
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,667
I've felt like everybody's
been staring at me

177
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,208
or talking about me.

178
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,834
It's as if I was
in<i> frame of mind.</i>

179
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,291
"Frame of Mind"?

180
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,583
Beverly's play.

181
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,375
Ever since I began
rehearsing for the role,

182
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,208
I've been uneasy
and restless.

183
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,500
You're probably
drawing on feelings

184
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
that you're not used
to expressing.

185
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,875
Right.

186
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:17,583
The play is full
of disturbing images--

187
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:21,208
people losing their minds,
being tortured by doctors.

188
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,417
I can't get it
out of my mind.

189
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:25,959
Sometimes it's healthy

190
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:30,000
to explore the darker side
of the psyche.

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,834
Jung called it
"owning your own shadow."

192
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:37,834
This could be a sign
that you're a real actor.

193
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:40,375
This is becoming more
than just a role to you.

194
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,792
Maybe you're right.

195
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,875
Don't be afraid
of your darker side.

196
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,792
Have fun with it.

197
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:53,834
Who's that?

198
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,792
You just missed him.

199
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,417
Is there a new
lieutenant on board?

200
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,333
I'm not sure.

201
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,458
Do you want me to check
the personnel logs?

202
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,542
No, I'll check them tomorrow.

203
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:05,125
I'm going to bed early.

204
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,250
The performance
is tomorrow night.

205
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,417
I want to be up for it.

206
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,083
I'm looking forward to it.

207
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,500
Break a leg.

208
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,542
I'll try not to
take you literally.

209
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,166
You're becoming agitated.

210
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,041
You bet I'm agitated!

211
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,792
I may be surrounded
by insanity,

212
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,417
but I am not insane

213
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,959
and nothing you
or anyone else can say

214
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,166
will change that.

215
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,583
And I won't let you

216
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,375
or anyone else
tell me that I am.

217
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,542
You may be able
to destroy my mind,

218
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:39,667
but you can't change
the fact that I'm innocent.

219
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:42,417
I didn't kill that man!

220
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,500
And that's
what's driving you crazy.

221
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,667
I can see we have
a lot of work to do.

222
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:57,375
Nothing you can say will
change the fact I'm innocent!

223
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,083
I'm not crazy!

224
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,875
I'm not crazy!

225
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,417
I'm not crazy.

226
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,917
(<i> applause</i> )

227
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,166
(<i> all shouting bravo</i> )

228
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:40,709
(<i> applause continues</i> )

229
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,625
Bravo, bravo!

230
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,917
(<i> applause stops abruptly</i> )

231
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:01,041
I can see we have
a lot of work to do.

232
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,041
Where am I?

233
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,208
How did you get me
off the ship?

234
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,250
The ship again?

235
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,000
What's going on?

236
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,792
I understand
this must be disturbing for you

237
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:31,291
but try to relax.

238
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,333
Tell me, where were you

239
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,375
a moment ago?

240
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,875
I was on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

241
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,250
I was in the middle of a play.

242
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,917
But it was<i> here.</i>

243
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:41,917
It was not real,
it was on a stage.

244
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:45,500
I can assure you,
this is not a stage.

245
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,417
Do you remember your name?

246
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:48,542
I'm Commander...

247
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,750
Commander...

248
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,166
A second ago, I knew who I was.

249
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:11,333
I was on the ship,
I was in a play...

250
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,709
and now I'm having trouble
remembering anything.

251
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,417
That's good.

252
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:18,750
You're starting to come out
of your delusional state.

253
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,834
Delusional?
It was not a delusion.

254
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:21,750
I was there.

255
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:26,709
We discussed this.
Do you remember?

256
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:29,542
We contacted Starfleet
and asked them

257
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,000
about you.

258
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,250
No.

259
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,709
We spoke with Admiral Budrow.

260
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:37,583
Starbase 29.

261
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,291
He had never heard of me

262
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,500
and they had no officer

263
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,083
that fit
my description.

264
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,041
That's right.

265
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,208
Now, I want you
to focus on who I am.

266
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,917
Do you remember me?

267
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,583
I don't know.

268
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,667
I'm Dr. Syrus.

269
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:03,583
Do you remember anything
about where you are now?

270
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:07,000
My head hurts.

271
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,375
Somebody hit me.

272
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,417
You tried to escape.

273
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,709
You struggled with one
of the attendants

274
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:15,875
and hit your head on a door.

275
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:16,792
Do you remember that?

276
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:20,417
Yes.

277
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,250
I remember that now.

278
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,333
But I thought it was a Klingon
who had cut me with a knife.

279
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,125
That's called transposition.

280
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,792
You're projecting elements
from your delusions

281
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:31,834
onto events
that really happened.

282
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:33,291
But that's good.

283
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,625
There was a time
when you couldn't break away

284
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,709
from your starship fantasy
at all.

285
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:47,625
Now...

286
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,500
if what you say is-is true...

287
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,834
where am I?

288
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:56,500
You're in ward 47

289
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,000
of the Tilonus Institute
for Mental Disorders.

290
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,000
Why am I here?

291
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,291
We'll talk more later.

292
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,125
You don't have to remember

293
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,291
everything today.

294
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,208
You're making
excellent progress.

295
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,291
Wait!

296
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,041
Oh...

297
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,166
(<i> ragged breathing</i> )

298
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,667
MAN:
Good afternoon.

299
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:05,875
I've got some good news
for you.

300
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,458
Dr. Syrus suggested
that you might enjoy

301
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,709
a couple of hours
in the common area today.

302
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,291
Well?

303
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:21,125
I guess so.

304
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,125
(<i> door slides open</i> )

305
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,166
I hope you're hungry.

306
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,834
They're serving
spiny lobe-fish today.

307
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:32,667
You won't need that.

308
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:33,834
(<i> chuckles</i> )

309
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:36,291
That's what you said
the last time.

310
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,458
(<i> man screams</i> )

311
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,583
(<i> man yelling</i> )

312
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,250
(<i> patient talking quietly</i> )

313
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,000
(<i> patients talking quietly</i> )

314
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,083
(<i> door buzzer</i> )

315
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,208
I'll be back
with your lunch.

316
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:04,417
I hear you're
a Starfleet officer.

317
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,166
I'm Commander Bloom
from the<i> Yorktown.</i>

318
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,834
There are at least a dozen
of us here, maybe more.

319
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,166
We were kidnapped--

320
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,375
brought here
against our will.

321
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,750
Sanders was
on the<i> Yosemite.</i>

322
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,417
They did something
to his mind.

323
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,250
I think they're trying
to get neurochemicals

324
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,208
from our brains.

325
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,208
Stafko was with me
on the<i> Yorktown.</i>

326
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,583
I don't know
what they did to him.

327
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,667
We're going to get out of here.

328
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,542
I've made
a communicator.

329
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,417
You have?
Yes.

330
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,000
There are
three starships in orbit.

331
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,500
They're going to beam us out
of here any day now.

332
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,375
I'll ask them
to get you out, too.

333
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,792
Commander Bloom
to<i> Yorktown.</i>

334
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:53,041
Come in,<i> Yorktown.</i>

335
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,166
I've made contact
with another officer.

336
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,709
Talking to your
starship again, Jaya?

337
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:57,959
No.

338
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,875
Don't let them tell you
you're crazy.

339
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,709
You know you're not
supposed to take

340
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:12,083
utensils from
the common area.

341
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,834
You're welcome to try it.

342
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,834
I'm not that far gone, am I?

343
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,333
Of course you are.

344
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,041
(<i> laughing</i> )

345
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:39,000
Your name is...

346
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,291
Mavek.

347
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,625
That's right.
Not bad for a crazy man.

348
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:51,500
I am beginning to remember
certain things.

349
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,375
Why am I here?

350
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,917
I remember
when they brought you in.

351
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:57,083
You were struggling...

352
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,375
screaming.

353
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,250
We could barely
hold you down.

354
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,750
In fact, just getting
the blood off your hands

355
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,125
took over an hour.

356
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,625
Blood?

357
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,375
On your hands,
clothes...

358
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,750
You didn't just kill that man--
you mutilated him.

359
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,750
What are you talking about?

360
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,083
I didn't kill anybody.

361
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:19,041
I'm afraid you did.
You stabbed him.

362
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:23,417
They found you near the body,
the knife in your hand.

363
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:25,208
(<i> whispers</i> ):
No...

364
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,542
that's not true!

365
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,291
Yes, it is.

366
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,166
And if you ever get out of here,
you're going to stand trial.

367
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,375
You're lying!

368
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,959
I imagine
the punishment

369
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,500
will be quite severe

370
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,417
considering you stabbed him
<i>nine</i> times.

371
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,500
(<i> yelling</i> ):
No!

372
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,166
(<i> panting</i> )

373
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,417
(<i> gasps in pain</i> )

374
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:55,583
(<i> gasps</i> )

375
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:07,041
I was there.

376
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,083
I was in ward 47,
just like in the play.

377
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,500
Everyone thought
that I was insane

378
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,458
that I had
actually killed someone.

379
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,208
But it was all real.

380
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,417
CRUSHER:
Deanna mentioned that
you went to bed early

381
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:21,959
because you were feeling
a little anxious about the play,

382
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:26,291
but I had no idea.

383
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:30,333
You said that in your dream,
we performed the play.

384
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,375
How did it go?

385
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,667
It was a smash.

386
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,792
We got a standing ovation.

387
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:39,542
Well, let's hope
it goes that well tonight.

388
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:43,291
Well, we have one hour
before curtain.

389
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:46,375
How are you feeling?

390
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,125
I feel like an actor.

391
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:53,208
Well, you're certainly
beginning to look the part.

392
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,291
Perhaps we should continue
this discussion

393
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,625
next week.

394
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,792
No, I want to talk
about this<i> now.</i>

395
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,792
You're starting to sound
angry again.

396
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,625
Maybe you need
another treatment.

397
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,417
What I need is to
get out of this cell!

398
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:07,750
I've been locked up
in here for days.

399
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,750
You've controlled
my every move.

400
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,333
You've told me what to eat,
what to think, what to say.

401
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:31,041
And when I show a glimmer
of independent thought...

402
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,792
And when I show a glimmer
of independent thought

403
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:40,333
you strap me down,
inject me with drugs

404
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,250
and call it a treatment.

405
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,083
You're becoming agitated.

406
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,291
You bet I'm agitated!

407
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:49,250
I may be surrounded by insanity,
but I am not insane

408
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,458
and there's nothing that you...

409
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,458
(<i> door clangs shut</i> )

410
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,583
What's happening?

411
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,917
I can see we have
a lot of work to do.

412
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:19,208
Nothing you can do will change
the fact that I'm innocent!

413
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,625
I'm not crazy!

414
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,291
I'm not...

415
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:28,291
You're the key to all this,
aren't you?

416
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,583
Who are you?!

417
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,333
Lieutenant Suna, sir.

418
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,041
Will, are you
all right?

419
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:42,583
No... uh... yes...

420
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,458
I don't know.

421
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,667
Why don't we go down
to Sick Bay?

422
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,333
There's nothing wrong
with you neurologically,

423
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,875
and I can't find anything

424
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,542
that could have caused
the hallucinations

425
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:01,959
but your heart rate
is way up

426
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:04,083
and your blood pressure
is above normal

427
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,792
and you are
physically exhausted.

428
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:08,625
This is not a case
of simple fatigue.

429
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,250
Will, you know

430
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,375
that when you're under
conditions of extreme stress

431
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,917
the mind can manufacture
all kinds of things.

432
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:17,333
Drugs... they injected me
with drugs.

433
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,250
See if there are
drugs in my system.

434
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,417
(<i> sighing</i> )

435
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,041
(<i> tricorder whirring</i> )

436
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,208
(<i> sighing</i> )

437
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,583
Nothing.

438
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:27,208
In that dream,
they gave me drugs.

439
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,000
Didn't anyone else
at the theater

440
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,792
see anything strange happen
during the performance?

441
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:33,875
No, nobody.

442
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,041
Get some rest, will.

443
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,083
The play is over.
Don't give it another thought.

444
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,208
Right.

445
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,583
How's Lieutenant Suna?

446
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,333
A little shaken,
but all right.

447
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:46,792
I feel like
such an idiot.

448
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,583
It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

449
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,208
We're your friends.

450
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,291
We all know the stress
you've been under.

451
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm sure everyone
understands perfectly.

452
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,458
Commander, I must
congratulate you

453
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,000
on your performance
this evening.

454
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,375
Oh?

455
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,333
Your unexpected choice
to improvise

456
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,291
was an effective method
of drawing the audience

457
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,375
into the plight
of your character.

458
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,125
You gave a
truly realistic
interpretation

459
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,542
of multi-infarct dementia.

460
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,083
Thank you.

461
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:16,166
Well, maybe not
everyone understands.

462
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,583
I think I'd better
get a little rest,

463
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,625
clear my mind a little.

464
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:25,458
I want you to try
some relaxation
techniques as well.

465
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,000
Remember the ones
I showed you a
few months ago?

466
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,875
They never seem to work for me.

467
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,208
SYRUS:
<i>Maybe you need</i>
<i>another treatment.</i>

468
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:34,583
What's wrong?

469
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:38,959
Nothing.

470
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,333
<i>Nothing.</i>

471
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,291
Will, I want you
to get some sleep.

472
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,709
I'll see you tomorrow.

473
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,667
Okay.

474
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,500
(<i> doors open</i> )

475
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,291
It's not real.
It's not real!

476
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:25,125
Don't let them tell you
you're crazy.

477
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,750
(<i> door clangs shut</i> )

478
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,083
No!

479
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:42,792
Let me out of here!

480
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:45,750
Let me out of here!

481
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,625
Help me!

482
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:52,792
Help me.

483
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:57,250
(<i> ragged sigh</i> )

484
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:02,959
I need help.

485
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,208
I don't want to be at the mercy

486
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,208
of these hallucinations
anymore.

487
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,834
So you've accepted
you're not from a starship

488
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:10,583
that it's all a delusion?

489
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:14,000
All I know is when I
go back to the ship

490
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
reality breaks apart,
nothing makes sense,

491
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,583
and then when it's over,
it fades away like a dream.

492
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:22,709
But when I'm in the hospital

493
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:24,417
everything here
seems real,

494
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:27,041
and I remember
everything that
happens here.

495
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,959
And what about
how you got here?

496
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,750
Maybe I did kill someone.

497
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,583
I don't know...

498
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,500
But I want to know how.

499
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,667
I'm glad to hear
you say that

500
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:42,291
because I just had
a long talk

501
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:44,709
with the hospital
administrator.

502
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,667
He told me there are
certain legal questions

503
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,667
that have to be resolved
relatively soon.

504
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,208
Meaning?

505
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:53,166
Meaning we can't keep you
here much longer.

506
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,166
We're the only
mental health facility

507
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,542
on Tilonus IV.

508
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:59,000
We have many people
who need our help.

509
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,667
I don't want to put
any undue stress on you,

510
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:05,458
but we have to settle this case
one way or another

511
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,709
within the next few days.

512
00:28:07,709 --> 00:28:09,125
What does that mean?

513
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,750
You're facing a choice.

514
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,834
We can try to help you
remember what happened

515
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:16,041
using reflection therapy.

516
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,417
If it's successful

517
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:19,500
you'd be fit
to stand trial.

518
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,917
Reflection therapy?

519
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,500
It's a way
for you to interact

520
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,333
with the various facets
of your personality.

521
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,709
We scan
the regions of your brain

522
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,291
that control
emotions and memory

523
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:34,083
and then project them
holographically.

524
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:36,208
And what is
the second option?

525
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:41,792
A complete
synaptic reconstruction

526
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:43,583
of your cerebral cortex.

527
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,417
Surgery.

528
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:51,041
We would neutralize
the synaptic pathways

529
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,333
responsible
for your mental instability.

530
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,250
And it doesn't sound
like you care for that option.

531
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,959
I don't.

532
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:02,333
The procedure is irreversible.

533
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,875
You'd be left with a completely
altered personality.

534
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:08,250
The person you are now
would cease to exist.

535
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,458
Option one is beginning
to sound better.

536
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,083
I agree.

537
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,792
Reflection therapy, then.

538
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,208
When do we begin?

539
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:24,250
This afternoon,
if you're ready.

540
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,375
I want you to understand

541
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:27,917
that this isn't going
to be easy.

542
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:30,834
You'll be interacting
with aspects of your psyche

543
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:32,834
you've never
dealt with before

544
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:34,417
and...

545
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:36,917
and you may be disturbed
by what they have to say.

546
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:55,417
Close your eyes.
Try to relax.

547
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:57,458
Clear your mind.

548
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,917
(<i> whirring</i> )

549
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:04,125
Now... think back

550
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:09,333
to before you came
to the hospital...

551
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,500
But don't try to remember
specific incidents.

552
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,792
Concentrate on
how you felt.

553
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:16,417
(<i> inhales and exhales</i> )

554
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:19,125
I was afraid.

555
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,417
Terrified.

556
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,083
She was with me
on the ship.

557
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,834
That's because
she represents

558
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,917
an aspect
of your personality

559
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:29,291
and there are
many parts of you
that still believe

560
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:30,458
you're on
that starship.

561
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:32,125
Why her?

562
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,333
I asked you to get in touch
with your feelings

563
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,458
and this is the part of you
that responded.

564
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,834
Talk to her

565
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:40,000
about how you felt
before you came here.

566
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:46,500
You said I was terrified.

567
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,792
Of what?

568
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:51,208
I was in a dark place--

569
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:55,291
cold... frightened.

570
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,583
Someone was there.

571
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:59,125
Who?

572
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:03,583
I felt threatened
by them, trapped.

573
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,083
You're doing very well.

574
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,542
Now, let's try
to find out

575
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:08,834
how you responded
to these feelings.

576
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,959
Try to focus on your actions.

577
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:13,917
You felt trapped.
What did you do?

578
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,417
I was angry.

579
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,625
They were attacking me.

580
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:21,041
I fought back.
I felt pain.

581
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,250
I was injured.

582
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,375
I began to panic.

583
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:26,792
There was a struggle, and I...

584
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:28,625
You what?
What happened?

585
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:34,500
Try to associate
your actions and emotions

586
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,709
with logical thoughts.

587
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:37,333
What do you think

588
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:40,208
caused you to act
and feel this way?

589
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:44,291
It was cold
and dark...

590
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:48,458
because...
I was outdoors

591
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:49,792
at night.

592
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,291
I was in
a narrow place.

593
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:53,917
I was walking
through an alley.

594
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:55,375
I felt threatened.

595
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:56,917
I was being watched.

596
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:59,834
Someone must have followed me
into the alley.

597
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:03,750
That's why I started
to walk faster.

598
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,458
Someone grabbed me
from behind.

599
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,500
I panicked.

600
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
I tried to fight them off.

601
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,125
How many of them
were there?

602
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:16,375
Three-- humanoid.

603
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,583
I only saw the face
of one of them.

604
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:19,375
What did he look like?

605
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,250
I saw him
on the ship, too.

606
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,333
I also saw him
here in the hospital,

607
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,250
but I don't
know who he is.

608
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,667
That's Mr. Suna,
the hospital administrator.

609
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,917
You met him
when you first arrived here.

610
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:38,291
What part of me
does he represent?

611
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,375
I don't know.

612
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,375
Don't believe this,
Will.

613
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:45,041
None of it's real.

614
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,083
You're with us
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

615
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,166
Doctor?

616
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,041
PICARD:
We're your colleagues.

617
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,458
You can trust us.

618
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:54,959
Everything will
be all right.

619
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:58,750
Do you have anything
to say to them?

620
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,917
(<i> heavy breathing</i> )

621
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:07,500
You're all delusions.

622
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,041
Do not listen
to him, Commander.

623
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,041
He is trying
to trick you.

624
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,667
You are
in danger here.

625
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,500
Let us help you.

626
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,375
TROI:
Listen to me, Will.

627
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,917
In all the years
we've known each other

628
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,917
have I ever lied to you?

629
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,041
No... please...

630
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:28,291
leave me alone!

631
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:31,458
Will... please?

632
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,625
No!

633
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,333
(<i> crying</i> )

634
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:43,208
You've taken a big step today.

635
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:44,750
You finally turned

636
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,083
your back on
those delusions

637
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,667
and all that they
represent to you.

638
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:52,000
We'll continue later.

639
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,375

(<i> door clangs shut</i> )

643
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,208
It's not real.

644
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:34,917
Commander,
do you know who I am?

645
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,667
Do you know where you are?

646
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,959
If you can't answer,
just listen.

647
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:51,208
You were
on an undercover mission

648
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:53,041
to Tilonus IV,
something happened.

649
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:55,959
We were told
that you killed somebody.

650
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:58,125
We do not believe
it's true.

651
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,875
We're being blocked
at every turn.

652
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,250
The hospital administrator

653
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,250
denies you're here at all.

654
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,500
We are beginning to think
that there's some sort

655
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,875
of conspiracy going on.

656
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:14,166
I had to come in here
posing as a health official.

657
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:17,875
Sit tight, Commander.

658
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:20,709
We are going to get you
out of here.

659
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,125
(<i> sighing</i> )

660
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,375

Commander...

665
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:59,083
Get away from me.

666
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,417
Commander, you
must come with us.

667
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:01,625
You are in danger here.

668
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:02,625
No!

Help me!
Help me!

673
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,083
Who are you?

674
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:41,792
Take them to

There's damage
to the parietal lobe.

682
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:18,000
It's as if someone's trying
to access his long-term memory,

683
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,208
and he's in a severe state
of neural shock.

684
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:25,208
It's going to take him
a while to recover.

685
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,583
Number One,

686
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:28,417
do you remember
what happened?

687
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:32,041
You were abducted during
the mission to Tilonus IV.

688
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,250
You were put
into a psychiatric hospital.

689
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,709
It's still bleeding.

690
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:47,750
It's minor.

691
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,583
Don't worry about it.

692
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,625
(<i> whirring</i> )

693
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:55,583
We have been checking
on the hospital administrator.

694
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,250
Mr. Suna.

695
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,750
It appears that he's involved
with one of the rival factions.

696
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,208
We believe
that he is responsible

697
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,625
for what happened to you.

698
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,333
It still hurts.

699
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,750
It's bleeding again.

700
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,375
Why?
You just healed it.

701
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:21,250
Will, try to calm down.

702
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,667
This isn't real.

703
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:35,417
What are you doing, Will?

704
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:38,959
If I'm right,
you're not really here.

705
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:40,500
This isn't a real phaser.

706
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,333
It's all a fantasy,

707
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:45,667
and I'm going to end it
no matter what it takes.

708
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:48,125
And what if it
isn't a fantasy?

709
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,834
Are you willing
to take that chance?

710
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:53,208
You're right.
I won't.

711
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,125
But I'm going to find out
what's real and what's not.

712
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,667
Will, don't do it!

How is he progressing?

Syrus:
He's not responding
to the reflection therapy.

His delusions
are growing more elaborate.

He broke out
of his cell last night.

00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,959
We found him running
down a corridor

719
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:15,417
claiming people

720
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:19,875
had come to take him
back to his starship.

721
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,792
Then, I see no other choice.

722
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:22,959
We'll have to perform

723
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:25,417
the synaptic
reconstruction.

724
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:27,667
I still have a phaser.
Why do I still have a phaser?

725
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,542
It's not a phaser--
it's a knife.

726
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:31,041
You stole it

727
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:32,333
from one of
the food trays.

728
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,083
Give it to me.

729
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,875
We don't want you
to hurt yourself.

730
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:37,834
(<i> groans</i> )

731
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:42,625
I don't believe you.

732
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:46,291
(<i> glass shattering</i> )

733
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:48,625
If this is a knife,
what happened to Mavek?

734
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:50,625
It's very complicated.

735
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:53,709
I'll answer all your questions,
but first I want you

736
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:55,583
to put that down.

737
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:59,959
No. If this is a real phaser,
then I was on the<i> Enterprise,</i>

738
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,959
but I fired it
on myself

739
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:03,291
so I should be dead.

740
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:07,250
None of this is real.

741
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:13,709
I'm setting this to level 16.

742
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:15,291
Wide field.

743
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,083
That should destroy
half of this building.

744
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,125
Unless, of course,
this isn't a real phaser.

745
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,917
(<i> glass shattering</i> )

746
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:38,542
It's all about
you, isn't it?

747
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:39,792
You're the only constant

748
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:41,458
the only person
in both places.

749
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:45,417
There's a lot more going on
here than you realize.

750
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:48,000
This isn't real, either.

751
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,291
What's happening to me?

752
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:53,166
Listen to me.

753
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:56,834
We can still save you,
but you must stop fighting us.

754
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:58,125
(<i> groans</i> )

755
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,208
You're lying.

756
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,542
Let me help you.

757
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:07,500
No!

758
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,041
I'm warning you...

759
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:12,250
No!

760
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,417
(<i> audience yelling, "bravo!"</i> )

761
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,750
(<i> glass shattering</i> )

762
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:29,083
(<i> beeping</i> )

763
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:39,125
He's conscious.

764
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,417
I haven't finished
the neuro drain!

765
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:42,500
Get him sedated!

766
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:50,625
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

767
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:51,792
WORF:
<i>Enterprise</i> here.

768
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:53,333
Are you all right, sir?

769
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:56,166
Emergency transport.
Get me out of here.

770
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:06,000
(<i> angry grunt</i> )

771
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,041
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46778.1.</i>

772
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,083
<i>Commander Riker</i>
<i>has returned safely</i>

773
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,125
<i>from his mission</i>
<i>to Tilonus IV.</i>

774
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,750
<i>Dr. Crusher has repaired</i>
<i>the damage</i>

775
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,875
<i>to his long-term memory.</i>

776
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:20,375
Evidently, you were abducted

777
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:22,208
two days after beaming
to the surface.

778
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:26,083
I remember now.
I was in an alley.

779
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,500
They attacked me from behind.

780
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,834
I tried to fight them off

781
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:31,500
with a<i> nisroh</i>
that Worf had given me.

782
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,458
I managed to get one
of them off me,

783
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:36,375
but I think they injected me
with some sort of drug.

784
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:37,834
We believe that
they were trying

785
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:39,917
to extract strategic
information

786
00:42:39,917 --> 00:42:42,834
from your memory
using a neurosomatic technique.

787
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:46,125
I was in a hospital, then I was
back on the<i> Enterprise,</i>

788
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:47,375
then I was back
in the hospital.

789
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:49,750
I kept shifting
from place to place.

790
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,750
I couldn't tell
what was real.

791
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,792
Your mind must
have created a
defense mechanism

792
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:56,500
that helped you resist

793
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,291
the neurosomatic
process.

794
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:02,458
Your unconscious fastened on
to elements of your real life

795
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,875
in an attempt to
keep you grounded

796
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,709
to keep you sane.

797
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:10,792
The preparation
for the mission,

798
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:13,041
the play.

799
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:17,333
Those were recent memories
fresh in my mind.

800
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,917
You should get some rest.

801
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:20,291
We can talk
some more tomorrow.

802
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:25,041
There is one thing
I'd like to do first.

803
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:27,458
Are you sure you want
to do this by yourself?

804
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:29,208
The stage crew and I

805
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,750
were going to do it
tomorrow morning.

806
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,083
I'm positive.

807
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,792
After everything
that I've experienced

808
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:36,375
I don't think I could sleep
knowing it was still up.
