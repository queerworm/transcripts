1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:03,000
Looking good.

2
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:05,000
I'll go five.

3
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:06,458
Five here.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,875
And five more.

5
00:00:08,917 --> 00:00:14,000
I believe the wiser course
of action here is to bend.

6
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,000
You mean fold, Data.

7
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,834
That is correct.
Fold: to bend,

8
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,417
to make compact,
or to capitulate.

9
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,959
I raise 50.

10
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,166
I do not believe
Lieutenant Worf

11
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,000
understands
all the nuances

12
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,583
of this betting procedure.

13
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,500
I wouldn't be
so quick to judge, Data.

14
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:33,333
His pile's a lot bigger
than yours.

15
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,959
Than any of ours.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,083
The cards have been favoring
the Lieutenant,

17
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,041
but that is the result
of random chance.

18
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,333
Therefore,
a temporary situation.

19
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,834
You hope.

20
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,375
Talk or play-- not both.

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,792
50, right?

22
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,291
50 is the bet.

23
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,959
What's the matter?

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,250
Feet getting cold?

25
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,417
My cards are getting cold.

26
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,959
Here you go.

27
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:03,583
I'm glad you stayed in.
I need the chips.

28
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,208
Talk, talk, talk.

29
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,792
Okay, here's the action.

30
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:10,667
Fifty.

31
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,208
And another 50.

32
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,417
Ouch.

33
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,333
Fold, fold, fold.

34
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:20,417
Your 50, and 50 more.

35
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:23,667
Love to play, but not
with these cards.

36
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,208
Looks like
it's just us, handsome.

37
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,375
I'll see you.

38
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:40,166
(<i> La Forge whistles</i> )

39
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,792
Beats my straight.

40
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,959
The iceman
wins again.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,875
You took my last chip.

42
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,792
You could at least
smile, Worf.

43
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:53,917
Smiling would break
his concentration.

44
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,208
Your deal.

45
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,375
Geordi?

46
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,792
The game is seven-card stud.

47
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,375
After the queen,
one-eyed jacks

48
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:09,125
and low card
in the hole are wild.

49
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,458
Wait a minute, let me
write this down.

50
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,041
I open with 50.

51
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,291
CREWMAN:
Bridge to Commander Riker.

52
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,083
We're receiving
a class 11 emergency signal

53
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,208
from Starfleet Command.

54
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,834
On my way.

55
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,834
50?
You were bluffing.

56
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,709
Klingons never bluff.

57
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,041
Yeah, right.

58
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,792
Mr. Data?

59
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,709
Emergency signal
reads as follows--

60
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,709
<i>"Enterprise</i> to divert
to coordinates 4-2-3

61
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,542
"by 1-1-2 by
5-1 immediately.

62
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,083
Further orders
forthcoming."

63
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,417
That's it?

64
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,959
What's the emergency?

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The message did not
elaborate, sir.

66
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,667
You'd think they'd
at least give us a hint.

67
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,083
CLANCY:
Course laid in, Captain.

68
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,291
Warp 8.

69
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,917
Whenever Starfleet
gets enigmatic,

70
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,667
I know we're about
to face a challenge.

71
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,542
Engage.

72
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:45,333
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

73
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:49,959
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

74
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,625
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

75
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:55,250
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

76
00:03:55,291 --> 00:04:00,166
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

77
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:04,625
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

78
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,166
Our destination is a point
near the Boradis system.

79
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,333
That area was colonized
recently, as I recall.

80
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,917
The first Federation outpost

81
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,041
was established 34 years ago
on Boradis III.

82
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,125
Since then,
the Federation has colonized

83
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,625
several planets in that sector.

84
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,875
Yet, we are not headed
for a specific colony.

85
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:24,500
The coordinates given are
outside the Boradis system.

86
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,750
Any problems reported
in that area?

87
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:28,458
DATA:
None, sir.

88
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,125
What the devil is going on?

89
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,709
WORF:
Captain.

90
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,875
Starfleet Command is hailing us.

91
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,667
About time.

92
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,834
On screen.

93
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,166
Greetings, Captain Picard.

94
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,041
My compliments, Admiral Gromek.

95
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,959
Captain, you will soon be joined
by a Federation special emissary

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,875
from Starbase 153.

97
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:50,834
We are now transmitting
the specifics.

98
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,500
We are receiving, sir.

99
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,625
GROMEK: The rendezvous
will be a bit tricky,

100
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,083
so it is imperative

101
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,417
that you reach the intercept
point on schedule.

102
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,792
Understood. And the mission?

103
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,959
The envoy will
fill you in.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,500
You are to cooperate fully.

105
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,291
Admiral, can you give me
any details?

106
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,500
Negative.

107
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,792
Admiral, it's a little
difficult to prepare

108
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,083
for a mission
I know nothing about.

109
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,166
I sympathize, Jean-Luc.

110
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,458
But Starfleet Command considers
this a top security matter.

111
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,417
Once the envoy has briefed you,

112
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,041
I think you will understand
our caution.

113
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,250
Gromek out.

114
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:39,125
Data, what ship is
transporting the envoy?

115
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,166
DATA: Apparently, there were
no starships available

116
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,125
on Starbase 153.

117
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:47,125
The envoy is aboard
a class-8 probe.

118
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:51,000
A class-8 probe is
just over two meters long.

119
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,417
Yes, that's true,
Number One.

120
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,542
But if the transmitters
and the sensors were removed

121
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,250
and a life-support
system installed,

122
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,417
there would be just enough
room for one person.

123
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,000
And it<i> is</i> designed
to travel at warp 9.

124
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,458
DATA: By sending the
probe to meet us

125
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,208
rather than diverting
the<i> Enterprise,</i>

126
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,166
they are saving us 6.1 hours.

127
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,041
Obviously, Starfleet feels
that time is of the essence.

128
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,750
But still, to seal someone
inside a class-8 probe

129
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:17,709
and launch it off,
that's a hell of a way

130
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,125
to transport a Federation
dignitary.

131
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:27,166
Coming to 3-1, mark 1-1-3.

132
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,166
We are on a course
precisely parallel

133
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,542
to the probe, sir.

134
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,041
Increase speed
to warp 8.9.

135
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,625
8.9, aye.

136
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,208
Full sensors aft.

137
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,000
Scanning.

138
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,583
Data, if we
project our course

139
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,750
beyond the rendezvous
coordinates,

140
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:46,083
what lies ahead?

141
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,583
As far as I can determine,
sir, very little.

142
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,583
There are four colonies
in the Boradis system

143
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,333
as well as nine other outposts
scattered throughout the sector.

144
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:57,041
I have it, sir.
Bearing 0-5, mark 2-3-1.

145
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,750
Velocity, warp 9.

146
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,667
I see it.

147
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,417
Adjust speed
to intercept.

148
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,166
Probe is coming up
to starboard.

149
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,041
Range 8,200.

150
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,917
Tractor beam ready.

151
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,709
Mr. La Forge?

152
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,542
Transporter ready, Captain.

153
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:31,750
Range now... 7,500.

154
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,750
Steady as she goes.

155
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,291
Probe is standing abeam.

156
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,041
Engage tractor beam.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,792
O'BRIEN: Transporter beam
locked, Captain.

158
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,166
Energize.

159
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,417
Probe aboard, Captain.

160
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,875
Acknowledged.
Number One.

161
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,166
I'll welcome our visitor.

162
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,458
Resume original course
and speed.

163
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,417
Aye, sir.

164
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,083
All yours, Commander.

165
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,750
Hmm.

166
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:52,542
Something wrong, Doctor?

167
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,458
I'm not sure.

168
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,083
The readings are
quite interesting.

169
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,208
I greet you.
I am K'Ehleyr.

170
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,959
<i>nuqneH qalegneS.</i>

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,083
You speak Klingon.

172
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,792
A little.
I'm Commander William Riker.

173
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,959
This is Chief Medical Officer
Katherine Pulaski.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,542
I hope your voyage
wasn't too unpleasant.

175
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,208
Klingons are not supposed
to mind hardship.

176
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,917
Nonetheless, I am delighted
to be out of that damned coffin.

177
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,333
I don't blame you, it's not
most luxurious accommodations

178
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,875
Starfleet has to offer.

179
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:29,500
Whoever said getting there
was half the fun

180
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,417
never rode in a class-A probe.

181
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,375
How are you feeling?

182
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:38,375
Your vital signs are rather
atypical for a Klingon.

183
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:41,458
No doubt
because I am only half Klingon.

184
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,083
Oh?

185
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,542
Yes, my father was Klingon.

186
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,291
My mother was human.

187
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,875
Captain.

188
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:56,792
Allow me to present Special
Federation Emissary K'Ehleyr.

189
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,834
Welcome aboard.
I'm Jean-Luc Picard.

190
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:05,917
This is Counselor Troi.

191
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,959
Lieutenant
Commander Data.

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,875
And this is Lieutenant...

193
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:12,250
Worf.

194
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,041
So, this is where
you've been hiding.

195
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,959
I told you we'd meet again.

196
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,542
Aren't you going to greet me?

197
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,792
I have nothing
to say to you.

198
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,875
Haven't changed a bit, hmm?

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,625
Well, I missed you, too.

200
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,792
Two days ago,
Starbase 336 received

201
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,917
an automated transmission
from a Klingon ship.

202
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,458
The<i> T'Ong.</i>

203
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,709
That ship was sent out
over 75 years ago.

204
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,792
When the Federation
and the Klingon Empire

205
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:57,959
were still at war.

206
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,458
The message was directed
to the Klingon High Command.

207
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,208
It said only that the ship
was returning home

208
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,792
and was about to reach
its awakening point.

209
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:09,625
Which suggests that the crew
had been in cryogenic sleep

210
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:11,000
for that long journey.

211
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,458
Exactly.

212
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,959
And when this crew is revived?

213
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,458
We'll have a ship
full of Klingons

214
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,041
who think the war
is still going on.

215
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,041
So, our task is to
find the ship

216
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,041
and tell the Klingons
they're no longer at war.

217
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,458
RIKER:
Why us?

218
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,125
Wouldn't a Klingon ship
be a better choice?

219
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,083
A Klingon ship,
the<i> P'Rang,</i> is on its way,

220
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,709
but it's two days behind us.
That may be too late.

221
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,917
Why too late?

222
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,250
RIKER: When the
<i>T'Ong</i> crew awakens,

223
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,500
it will be within
striking range

224
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,208
of several
Federation outposts.

225
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,625
There are 13 colonies

226
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,792
with minimal defenses
in that sector.

227
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:45,917
Nice, ripe targets
for a Klingon warship.

228
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,667
And you believe you can
convince these Klingons

229
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,500
that the humans
are now their allies?

230
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:53,834
No, not a chance.

231
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,250
If you ask me, talking will be
a waste of time.

232
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,375
Klingons of that era
were raised

233
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,834
to despise humans.

234
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,375
We'll try diplomacy,

235
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,792
but I promise you,
it won't work.

236
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:08,166
And then, you'll have
to destroy them.

237
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,291
No.

238
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,500
No?

239
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,125
Captain,
these Klingons are killers.

240
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,875
You'll have no choice.

241
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,208
We shall find another choice.

242
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,625
I want options,
and I want them

243
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,000
before we encounter
the Klingon ship.

244
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,917
Lieutenant...

245
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,375
I'm assigning you
to help the emissary.

246
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,125
Dismissed.

247
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,041
I will escort you
to the guest quarters.

248
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,041
Captain.

249
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:53,166
Lieutenant?

250
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:00,959
Sir, I suggest
Commander Riker or Data

251
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,709
would better serve
Special Emissary K'Ehleyr.

252
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,792
Are there any personal reasons

253
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:08,458
that you don't want
the assignment?

254
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,125
Yes.

255
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:13,375
Any professional reasons?

256
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,834
No.

257
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,417
I withdraw my request, Captain.

258
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,333
Good.

259
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,792
I didn't know
it was possible

260
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:37,375
for a human and a Klingon
to produce a child.

261
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,458
Actually, the DNA
is compatible,

262
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,667
with a fair amount of help.
Rather like my parents.

263
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,792
I know exactly
what you mean.

264
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:47,625
My father was human, and
my mother is a Betazoid.

265
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,083
Really?

266
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,417
It was the other way
around for me.

267
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,208
My mother was human.

268
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,792
You must have grown up
like I did--

269
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,625
trapped
between cultures.

270
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,041
I never felt trapped.

271
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:02,291
I tried to experience
the richness and diversity

272
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,792
of the two worlds.

273
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:06,458
Perhaps you got
the best of each.

274
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,542
Myself, I think I got
the worst of each.

275
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,625
Oh, I doubt that.
Oh, yes.

276
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,625
Having my mother's sense
of humor is bad enough.

277
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,500
It's gotten me
into plenty of trouble.

278
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,417
And your Klingon side?

279
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,000
That, I keep under
tight control.

280
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,667
It's like a terrible temper.

281
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:33,333
It's not something
I want people to see.

282
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,166
Everyone has tempers.

283
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,542
Not like mine.

284
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:41,291
Sometimes I feel
there's a monster inside of me

285
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,208
fighting to get out.

286
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,166
And it frightens you.

287
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,083
Of course it does.

288
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:52,000
My Klingon side can be...
terrifying,

289
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,500
even to me.

290
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:55,291
It gives you strength.

291
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,083
It's a part of you.

292
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,417
That doesn't mean
I have to like it.

293
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:19,583
You are late.

294
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,709
Sorry.

295
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,542
Had to make
myself beautiful.

296
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,834
I fail to understand why.

297
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,709
Worf, we're alone now.

298
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,166
You don't have to act
like a Klingon glacier.

299
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,583
I don't bite.

300
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,417
Well, that's wrong...

301
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,208
I do bite.

302
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,458
Shall we proceed
with our assigned duties?

303
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,083
You weren't this aloof
six years ago.

304
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,792
Or don't you remember?

305
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:49,000
There is nothing wrong
with my memory.

306
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,875
Well, there's something
wrong with the rest of you.

307
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,458
You're not even looking at me.

308
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,959
I'm familiar
with your appearance.

309
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:09,083
And it gives you
no pleasure to see me again.

310
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:16,458
It isn't as if we tried it
and it didn't work, you know.

311
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,000
You never gave it a chance.

312
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,291
<i>I</i> never?

313
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:28,250
I mean, as I see it,
we have some...

314
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:34,417
unfinished business, you and I.

315
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:40,583
Not as far as I'm concerned.

316
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,500
According to the
library computer,

317
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:55,500
the Captain of the
<i>T'Ong</i> is K'Temoc.

318
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,333
But there is nothing
regarding the ship's mission.

319
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,750
Probably some
secret military objective.

320
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:06,208
Perhaps, but we have
no evidence of that.

321
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,041
Why else would there be
no record of the mission?

322
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,333
The records may simply
have been lost.

323
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,458
What does it matter?

324
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,166
Our concern is the present.
The possible threat.

325
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,583
And to contend with that threat,
we need information.

326
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:26,041
We have all the
information we need.

327
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:30,208
That is foolish.

328
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,542
Knowing their mission
might help us understand them.

329
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,625
There is nothing to understand.

330
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:37,667
These are Klingons!
They'll attack.

331
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:40,667
In their minds,
we're the enemy.

332
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:44,125
And there's no way we're going
to talk them out of that.

333
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,542
And I do not appreciate
being interrupted.

334
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,834
And I do not appreciate
wasting my time.

335
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,125
We were instructed to
come up with options.

336
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,000
There aren't any,
the assignment's hopeless.

337
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,583
There are always options.

338
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,291
Oh, are there?

339
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,709
Tell me, whatever happened

340
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,166
to that wonderful
Klingon fatalism of yours?

341
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,250
My experiences aboard this ship
have taught me

342
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,834
most problems have
more than one solution.

343
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:19,125
Starfleet hasn't
improved you one bit.

344
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,417
You're as stubborn as ever.

345
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:26,542
Are you going to carry out
your duties or aren't you?

346
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,667
All right, I will.

347
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:32,375
Upon due consideration
of the problem

348
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:36,291
and careful examination
of all possible options,

349
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:40,291
my original recommendation
stands.

350
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,000
Meeting adjourned.

351
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,625
(<i> screaming</i> )

352
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,625
(<i> door chime</i> )

353
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:29,208
(<i> groans</i> )
Come.

354
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,667
You're upset.

355
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,750
Your finely honed
Betazoid sense

356
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,000
tell you that?

357
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,208
Well, that and the table.

358
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,417
(<i> chuckles</i> )

359
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,667
I warned you
about my Klingon half.

360
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,125
May I make a suggestion?

361
00:20:56,166 --> 00:21:01,083
I thank you, Counselor,
but I don't want any counseling.

362
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,959
Actually, I was going to
suggest something else.

363
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,625
Oh?

364
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,667
I find the exercise programs
on the holodeck

365
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:12,458
rigorous enough to take
my mind off most frustrations.

366
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,083
And it'll keep me
from wrecking the ship.

367
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,709
That, too.

on all tactical

387
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,083
We just ran a full test
on those systems.

388
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,875
I feel it necessary
to check them again.

I commend your diligence.

However, I'm concerned

392
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,250
that you're working
yourself too hard.

393

Sir, considering the unknown

Lieutenant,
I order you to relax.

I am relaxed.

00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:13,041
Yes, sir.

397
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:27,583
I've never before seen
the Lieutenant so unsettled.

use humor as a shield.

Whereas others
take a simpler approach.

00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,834
I was.

438
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:37,417
No, we were both too young,

too unaware.

440
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,583
We lacked commitment.

441
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:48,458
Perhaps we lacked
courage as well.

442
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:53,750
No longer.

00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:08,000
Yes, I know.
I was there. But--

447
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,959
And now, we must solemnize
our union with the oath.

I am not going
to become your wife.

You already are.

Don't give me that
Klingon nonsense.

They're not sacred.

453
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,375
They're absurd.

454
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,041
Marrying you

455
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:31,208
is out of the question
for a million reasons.

456
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,333
None of which
stopped you earlier.

00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,917

and all that--

459
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,166
but it doesn't mean anything.

460
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,583
That is a human attitude.

461
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:47,959
I am human!

462
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,834
You are also Klingon.

463
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:52,917
So, that means
we should bond for life?

It is our way.

Full impulse.
Engage.

478
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,083
I hope we find them before
they come out of their nap.

479
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:55,375
Agreed.

480
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:57,041
There's not an outpost
in this area

481
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:00,041
that could defend itself
from a Klingon warship.

482
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:08,667
I've been working
on our assignment,

483
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:12,125
trying a few
computer simulations.

484
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:16,083
Your devotion to duty
is commendable, if belated.

485
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:24,208
Unwilling to be alone with me?

486
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,291
I asked Commander Data

487
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,625
to help us analyze
the alternatives.

488
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:33,792
An android chaperone?

489
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,125
"Android," of course,
is correct,

490
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:40,041
but I fail to
see how "chaperone"

491
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,542
is applicable to
this situation.

492
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:46,542
Never mind.

493
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:48,667
I guess I can't blame you.

494
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,709
Tell me one thing.

495
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:57,291
You would have gone through
with the oath, wouldn't you?

496
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,709
Regardless of
the consequences

497
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,250
to our careers, to our lives?

498
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:07,208
Honor demanded no less.

499
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:10,083
What do you<i> want?</i>

500
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:13,125
Is honor all you
care about?

501
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:16,041
Don't you feel
anything else?

502
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:20,709
No comment, huh?

503
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,750
Poor android.

504
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:29,417
Whose behavior do you
find more perplexing,

505
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:33,333
human... or Klingon?

506
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:42,083
At the moment, I would
find it difficult to choose.

507
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,500
So would I.

508
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:49,083
Okay, when we locate the<i> T'Ong,</i>

509
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,625
there are two possibilities.
First...

510
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:54,625
We find the ship before it
reaches the awakening point.

511
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:57,166
In that case, we simply
keep the crew asleep.

512
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,792
Is that feasible?

513
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,667
We can beam an away team
over to the<i> T'Ong</i> and override

514
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:02,291
their cryogenic controls, sure.

515
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,250
That way, we simply
await the arrival

516
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:06,417
of the Klingon ship<i> P'Rang.</i>

517
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,875
So that when the
<i>T'Ong's</i> crew awakens,

518
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:11,083
they're surrounded
by their fellow Klingons.

519
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,458
That would be ideal.

520
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,417
But there's
the second possibility

521
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:18,667
that the crew of the<i> T'Ong</i>
has already revived.

522
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:20,792
They realize they're
in Federation territory,

523
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,834
and attack the nearest outpost.

524
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,083
They could have been
on a scientific voyage.

525
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:29,500
Klingons of that era doing
research for its own sake?

526
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:31,291
The point is,
they may be reasonable.

527
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:34,333
The point is that this is
beside the point.

528
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:37,333
These are Klingons
at war with us.

529
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,792
Whatever their mission was,

530
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:42,291
once they see a Federation
target, they'll attack.

531
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:46,709
Could the<i> T'Ong</i> be disabled
rather than destroyed?

532
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,208
We could probably knock out
their warp drive engines

533
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,750
without damaging
the rest of the ship.

534
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,875
That would gain you nothing.
Disable the ship,

535
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:54,917
and K'Temoc will
destroy it himself.

536
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:57,667
Klingons do not surrender.

537
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,125
If we don't reach the<i> T'Ong</i>
before its crew wakes up,

538
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,333
you have no alternatives.

539
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,458
I can't accept that.

540
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:12,333
There must be some way that we
can make the Klingons listen.

541
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,208
If we could only
convince them--

542
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,250
DATA:
Captain, we are detecting a ship

543
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,667
bearing 3-1-6, mark 4-2.

544
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:20,333
Extreme sensor range.

545
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:23,000
Lay an intercept course.
Go to Yellow Alert.

546
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:33,875
Shields are up.

547
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:35,208
Better lock in phasers.

548
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,041
This may be the
only chance you get.

549
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,875
Intercept course
laid in.

550
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:41,750
Hold this position.
Let's see if they've spotted us.

551
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,959
Magnification 100.

552
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:51,792
Mr. Data?

553
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,667
Sensors show
life-forms aboard,

554
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:54,875
but I am unable to ascertain

555
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:56,625
whether they are awake
or dormant.

556
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:58,834
However, their propulsion
system is inactive,

557
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:02,000
so I would hypothesize
that the crew is asleep.

558
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,875
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

559
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:05,834
However, I could
be in error.

560
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:09,583
Shields holding.

561
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,500
They've cloaked themselves.

562
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:18,250
Well, Captain...

563
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:20,375
you've had your chance.

564
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,417
Transferring Engineering
to the Bridge.

565
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:36,542
Can you find them?

566
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:40,583
I think so.
Those old shields

567
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:43,709
weren't particularly efficient
at blocking gamma ray output.

568
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:47,041
If I can tune the sensors
to a particular band of...

569
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,083
There, got them.

570
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:51,083
Transferring
coordinates to helm.

571
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,583
Intercept, warp 2.

572
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,083
CLANCY:
Warp 2, sir.

573
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:57,083
Captain, let them die
like Klingons-- in battle.

574
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,917
They deserve that much.

575
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,125
Captain.

576
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,750
I have another option.

577
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:21,667
<i>Captain's log,</i>
<i>stardate 42901.3.</i>

578
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:23,166
<i>Despite their cloaking shields,</i>

579
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:25,625
<i>we have located</i>
<i>the Klingon vessel</i> T'Ong.

580
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,917
<i>In an effort to avoid</i>
<i>further confrontation,</i>

581
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:29,917
<i>we're about to implement</i>
<i>the option</i>

582
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,667
<i>presented by Lieutenant Worf.</i>

583
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:33,917
The<i> T'Ong</i> has
changed course

584
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,250
to 3-2, mark 8-1.

585
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:38,000
Increasing to warp 3.

586
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:40,083
Standard evasive maneuver.

587
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,500
Helm, stay with them.

588
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:43,083
Yes, sir.

589
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:44,667
The<i> T'Ong</i> is now
on a heading

590
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:46,750
of 4-2, mark 1-1-3.

591
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:48,959
They are accelerating
to warp 5.

592
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,542
They're gonna make
a break for it.

593
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,291
Mmm. Overtake.
Warp 8.

594
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,458
Aye.

595
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,458
Now, put us right
in their path

596
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,041
and come
to a full stop.

597
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,375
Full power to shields.

598
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,625
CREWMAN:
Full power, sir.

599
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:13,000
Well, we've thrown
down the gauntlet.

600
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:15,250
Let's see if
they pick it up.

601
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:17,709
They are slowing to impulse,
sir.

602
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:24,125
Phaser hit
on forward shields.

603
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:26,875
Firming up now, no damage.

604
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:29,458
I guess we've piqued
their interest now.

605
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,667
Agreed.

606
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:33,917
Let's give them a chance

607
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,750
to look their enemy
in the face.

608
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:37,291
Ready, Lieutenant?

609
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,834
WORF:
Open hailing frequencies.

610
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,333
CREWMAN:
Open, sir.

611
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:49,000
What?

612
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:50,875
What is this?

613
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:55,375
Captain K'Temoc, have
you lost your mind?

614
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:58,333
Halt your vessel
and drop your shields.

615
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:01,792
What treachery is this?
By whose authority?

616
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:04,750
I am Worf,
commanding the<i> Enterprise,</i>

617
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:07,375
and it is you who have committed
an act of treason

618
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:09,208
by firing on this vessel.

619
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,417
I have standing orders to fire
on all Federation ships.

620
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,083
You fool!

621
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:20,291
Did it not occur to you that
the war would be over by now?

622
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:23,333
I have no proof of that.

623
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,542
Trust your eyes.

624
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:29,583
Or is your brain still stuck
in its long slumber?

625
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,750
How do I know this is not
a Federation trick?

626
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:35,917
How can I be sure?

627
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,959
Captain, as you are
new to this century,

628
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I have tried to be patient.

629
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:49,417
But I will tolerate
no further insubordination.

630
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,834
Drop your shields
immediately.

631
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,291
And if I refuse?

632
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,291
Then die in ignorance.

633
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:03,166
I can waste no more
time on you.

634
00:39:06,917 --> 00:39:08,291
Phasers to full power.

635
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,375
CREWMAN:
Aye, sir.

636
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:12,083
Phasers ready.
Target locked.

637
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:18,417
You dare not destroy us.

638
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:22,917
We are on a crucial mission
for the Klingon High Command.

639
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:25,000
Has the<i> T'Ong</i>
dropped its shields?

640
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:27,208
CREWMAN:
No, sir.

641
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:31,208
Very well, fire all phasers.

642
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,750
Wait!

643
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:46,500
Lower the shields.

644
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:50,583
I yield command of the<i> T'Ong</i>
to you, Captain Worf.

645
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:55,458
Long live the
Klingon Empire.

646
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,333
A wise decision, Captain.

647
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:08,083
Commander K'Ehleyr will board
your vessel and take command.

648
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:10,208
The Klingon cruiser
<i>P'Rang</i> will soon arrive

649
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,166
and escort you home.

650
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,875
And, Captain...

651
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:17,125
Yes?

652
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:20,041
Welcome to the 24th century.

653
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:35,208
I return command
of the ship to you, Captain.

654
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,709
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Congratulations.

655
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,917
A very fine first command.
Well done.

656
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,083
How did you like command?

657
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:54,083
Comfortable chair.

658
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:01,458
And you wore it well.

659
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:14,750
One to beam aboard the<i> T'Ong.</i>

660
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,834
All set.

661
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,208
I relieve you.

662
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,041
But...

663
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:23,000
Yes, Lieutenant.

664
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:29,583
The Klingon vessel<i> P'Rang</i>

665
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,709
will rendezvous with you
in three days.

666
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,375
In the meantime,
I'll begin the assimilation

667
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:37,709
of these Klingons to our era.

668
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:50,333
Is there anything else
you require?

669
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:54,500
No.

670
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:56,667
Nothing else.

671
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:09,834
Damn you, Worf.

672
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:13,875
You'd let me go without saying
another word, wouldn't you?

673
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
What needs to be said?

674
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:24,208
Nothing. Everything.

675
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,542
We're about to go
our separate ways again.

676
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:29,709
And that disturbs you?

677
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:36,166
I hid the truth from you.

678
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:38,709
Last night did have meaning.

679
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:50,166
I was tempted to take
the oath with you.

680
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:54,417
That scared me.

681
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:58,542
I've never had such strong
feelings toward anyone.

682
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,834
Nor have I.

683
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:16,625
Then it was more
than just a point of honor.

684
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:25,083
Maybe someday,
when our paths cross again...

685
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:29,667
I won't be so easy
to get rid of.

686
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:08,750
K'Ehleyr...

687
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:15,500
I will not be complete
without you.

688
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:23,208
(<i> console controls beep</i> )
