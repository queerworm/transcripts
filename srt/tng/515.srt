PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45571.2.</i>

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,208
<i>We are going into orbit around</i>
<i>an unexplored M-Class moon</i>

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,917
<i>of Mab-Bu VI.</i>

4
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:12,959
<i>Though the moon was reported</i>
<i>to be uninhabited</i>

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,166
<i>we have picked up</i>
<i>a weak distress call.</i>

6
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,834
(<i> staticky distress call</i>
<i>playing</i> )

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,083
DATA:
The electromagnetic whirlwinds
on the moon's surface

8
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,333
make it virtually
impossible to locate the source

9
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,709
of the signal, Captain.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,250
Any indications
of life, Mr. Worf?

11
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,834
Scanners read
negative, sir

12
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,500
but they may be affected
by the interference.

13
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,458
Have you ever
heard anything
like this, Data?

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,417
I believe so, Commander.
At Starfleet Academy.

15
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,417
The Academy?

16
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,458
I will verify it.

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,166
Just as I thought.

18
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,750
It is a Starfleet
subspace distress signal.

19
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:47,291
Standard to Daedalus-class
starships.

20
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,375
There hasn't been
a Daedalus-class

21
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:50,208
in service
for... what?

22
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,583
172 years, sir.

23
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:52,792
Are there any records

24
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,542
of missing ships
in this vicinity?

25
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,667
The USS<i> Essex,</i> under the command
of Captain Bryce Shumar

26
00:00:57,709 --> 00:01:00,583
disappeared in this sector
over two centuries ago.

27
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,792
Daedalus-class.

28
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:04,750
I have accessed the subspace
transponder signature

29
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:06,542
of the<i> Essex. </i>

30
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,417
It is identical to the signal
coming from the moon's surface.

31
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,583
We arrived a
little late.

32
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,250
Mute it, Mr. Data.

33
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,083
With all that storm activity
down there

34
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,750
it isn't worth
the risk to check
on a ghost ship.

35
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:20,458
Advise Starfleet
that we have solved

36
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,458
the mystery of
Captain Shumar
and the<i> Essex.</i>

37
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,125
I'm not sure we<i> have.</i>

38
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,792
Someone's
down there.

39
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:33,166
Alive.

40
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:11,500
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

41
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:15,542
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

42
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,333
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

43
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:21,125
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

44
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:25,709
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

45
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,625
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

46
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,750
RIKER:
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

47
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,709
<i>The electromagnetic</i>
<i>interference on the surface</i>

48
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,333
<i>has been judged too dangerous</i>
<i>for anyone to transport down</i>

49
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,458
<i>so we have taken a shuttle</i>
<i>to investigate.</i>

50
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:43,959
Shields are holding, sir.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,792
Wind shear is
incredible.

52
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:50,875
Data, keep an eye
on the stabilizers.

53
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,250
If it's anything like
this on the ground

54
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,542
I don't see how
people could survive

55
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,959
on this moon
for very long.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
Maybe they've been
living underground.

57
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:57,542
Question is, where?

58
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,667
I still can't locate
the source

59
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,166
of the damn signal.

60
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,750
It's bouncing around
more than we are.

61
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:05,417
Forward thrusters
have failed, sir.

62
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,625
We are losing power.

63
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,542
<i>Enterprise!</i> 
Go ahead.

64
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,125
RIKER (<i> distorted</i> ):
We've lost our thrusters.

65
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,667
Attempting to compensate
with secondary boosters.

66
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,500
Sir, the shuttlecraft's impulse
generators have shut down.

67
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,458
Commander, can
you hear me?

68
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,250
<i>Enterprise</i> to shuttle.
Please respond.

69
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,583
Hold on.
We're going down.

70
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,500
Initiating emergency
landing procedures.

71
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,125
Maintain the approach
attitude, Data.

72
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,542
I'm taking her in.

73
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,709
Brace for impact.

74
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,834
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

75
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,000
The shuttle has crashed
on the surface.

76
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,458
Do you have their position?

77
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,583
I am picking up
the shuttle's trace signature

78
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,208
but the surface interference
is distorting its position.

79
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,500
Can you locate them?

80
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:04,000
I think<i> I</i> can.

81
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,959
I followed their entry
almost all the way in.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,250
We can calculate
the coordinates

83
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,375
from their angle
of descent.

84
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:25,792
Ow!

85
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:27,000
Your arm.

86
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,083
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
that's broken.

87
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,750
<i>Enterprise?</i>

88
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,166
It is unlikely
we will be able

89
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,583
to establish
communication
with the ship

90
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,625
given the electromagnetic
interference.

91
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,709
Then we'll stay in the area
until the<i> Enterprise</i> finds us.

92
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,291
Take an inventory
of the shuttle.

93
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:43,208
See if there's anything left
in there that's usable.

94
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,041
The ground cover
is all nonporous rock

95
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,542
which makes me believe
it's even less likely

96
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,875
there's anyone living here.

97
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:51,291
There are no instruments left
of practical value

98
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,500
that have not been damaged
by our landing, sir.

99
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:57,917
What is<i> that?</i>

100
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,000
That doesn't look like any
storm front I've ever seen.

101
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,542
The tricorder is picking up
high levels

102
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,625
of EM bursts
across the spectrum.

103
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,834
No life sign readings
other than our own.

104
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,250
There<i> is</i> someone
alive here.

105
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,375
I'm more certain
of it now than ever.

106
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,083
Well, I hope
they can find us

107
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,375
because there's no way
we'll find them.

108
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,500
They're coming.

109
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,500
They're coming
with the storm.

110
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,333
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

111
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,250
We can't get a pattern lock
on their communicators

112
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,500
because of
the EM bursts, Captain.

113
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,875
There's no way we can
beam them out of there.

114
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,333
Not under these
conditions.

115
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,750
The same conditions won't permit

116
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,500
a shuttle to land safely,
Mr. La Forge.

117
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:33,125
Any suggestions?

118
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,208
O'BRIEN:
Give us a minute, Captain.

119
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,041
Sir, let me beam down
with a pattern enhancer.

120
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,458
Chief, there's
no guarantee

121
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,208
you won't rematerialize
in a million pieces

122
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,709
if your signal gets caught up in
that electromagnetic whirlwind.

123
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,041
I can boost
the confinement beam.

124
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,542
One person might be
able to make it.

125
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:51,959
Captain, Chief O'Brien
wants to beam down

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,125
to the surface
with a pattern enhancer.

127
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,667
His chances
of making it down there safely

128
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:59,208
are no better than 50-50,
in my opinion.

129
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,959
Captain, a major storm
front is moving in

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,875
on the away team's
coordinates.

131
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,792
You're aware
of the risks, Mr. O'Brien?

132
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,208
Yes, sir.

133
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,625
I think I can make it.

134
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,041
All right, then.
Good luck.

135
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,166
Aye, sir.

136
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,792
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

137
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,125
RIKER:
Mr. O'Brien!

138
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,250
Nice of you
to join us.

139
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,583
Nice spot
for a picnic, sir.

140
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,542
We need to distribute
these enhancer rods

141
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,375
at seven-meter lengths.

142
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,625
That should do it.

143
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:42,834
Is this storm front
going to interfere

144
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,291
with the transport, Chief?

145
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,709
I'd really like
to get us out of here

146
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,000
before it hits,
Commander.

147
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,750
I'm supposed to be feeding
the baby lunch.

148
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,208
Molly gets
in a terribly foul mood

149
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,333
if I'm late.

150
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,417
I'm with you.

151
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,375
Lunch time, Miles!

152
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:04,333
Let's do it!

153
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,291
(<i> yells</i> )

154
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,375
(<i> groans</i> )

155
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,291
(<i> screams</i> )

156
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,291
Easy, Deanna.

157
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,709
Where...?

158
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,709
You're back
on the<i> Enterprise</i> now.

159
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,709
You're going to be okay.

160
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,959
My skin--
it's tingling.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,208
You're experiencing
the after-images

162
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,291
of the electromagnetic
discharge.

163
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,500
The sensation
will pass.

164
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,875
They're all
fine, too.

165
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:09,291
Now, I want you
to take your time, Counselor.

166
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,542
Doctor's orders.

167
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,417
(<i> door opens</i> )

168
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,208
Injury report, Doctor.

169
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,750
Mostly minor abrasions.

170
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,000
Commander Riker
took the worst of it

171
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,709
with a broken arm.

172
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,917
Mr. Data.

173
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,083
Good work, Chief.

174
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,834
Thank you, sir.

175
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,291
Ready for duty, sir.

176
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,625
You're sure, Number One?

177
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,792
It's not the first broken bone
I've ever had.

178
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,625
And how are you, Counselor?

179
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,417
Very glad to be here.

180
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,625
Good. Let's go.

181
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,166
So, what happened down there?

182
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,625
It was just one
hell of a storm.

183
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,875
It moved in on our position

184
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:41,375
faster than anything
I've ever seen.

185
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,166
Was there any
evidence of life?

186
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,709
No, but if Troi was right

187
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,667
we were pretty close
to it.

188
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:49,834
Bridge. So, how do you
suggest we proceed?

189
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,166
We need to adjust
the scanners

190
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,625
so that they can penetrate
those storms.

191
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,375
Do you have
any ideas, Data?

192
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:56,625
We might be able
to employ virtual imaging

193
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,000
in order to interpolate...

194
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,875
(<i> creaking</i> ):
missing data.

195
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:03,250
Is something wrong,
Commander?

196
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,583
My apologies, sir.

197
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,709
It seems
my primary speech processors

198
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,333
are experiencing
a minor fluctuation.

199
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,542
I will have it corrected
in a moment.

200
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,458
Captain, may I
speak with you

201
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,083
for a moment--
in private?

202
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,917
Of course. You'll have
the Bridge, Number One.

203
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,542
Mr. Data, deploy sensor scans
when you're ready.

204
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,917
Ensign, take us
to a synchronous orbit

205
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,291
aligned around
our crash site.

206
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,875
RO:
Aye, sir.

207
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,333
Sir, given the EM field
properties of this moon

208
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,417
I recommend a search pattern

209
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,709
beginning in the southern
polar region.

210
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,750
The polar region?

211
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:39,250
That would be starting
from scratch, Mr. Data.

212
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,750
Our latest readings
would suggest

213
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:43,375
that we begin our scan
around our crash site.

214
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:46,000
The<i> Essex</i> signal
was never clearly located, sir.

215
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,125
A systematic survey
of the moon

216
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,834
from a polar orbit
might be more practical.

217
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,625
Well, you may be right,
but I'd like to give

218
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,542
the crash site
a once-over first.

219
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,709
Maintain our current orbit.

220
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,250
Understood, sir.

221
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,166
I've never felt
anything like it.

222
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,125
It was as though
they were calling to me.

223
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,583
Are you saying someone was
communicating telepathically?

224
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,625
Perhaps...

225
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,917
for an instant.

226
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,083
It was like their voices
were being carried on the wind.

227
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,375
What were they trying
to communicate?

228
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:24,041
I'm not sure.

229
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:29,208
But they<i> were</i> calling me
to the southern polar region.

230
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,208
I believe that's where we
should look for the<i> Essex.</i>

231
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,667
Commander,
did you override

232
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,583
my orbital heading?

233
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,875
Override them?

234
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,250
We've moved
into a polar orbit

235
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,709
and I'm locked out.

236
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,542
The helm isn't
responding.

237
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,333
Do you know anything
about this, Mr. Data?

238
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,333
Data?

239
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,542
(<i> groans</i> )

240
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,875
Security to the Bridge!

241
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:02,917
RIKER:
Computer, transfer command
to Engineering.

242
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,041
Full security alert.

243
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,375
(<i> groans</i> )

244
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,792
This way.
What happened?

245
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,417
He would not move
to a polar orbit.

246
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,625
You couldn't wait?

247
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:22,959
The Captain would
have done it for me.

248
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,792
Deck 36. Engineering.

249
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:28,250
Computer,
re-enable Bridge control.

250
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,667
Security protocol.

251
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,959
Authorization:
Riker Omega Three.

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,458
Report.

253
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,917
Data, O'Brien and Troi
tried to commandeer the ship.

254
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,458
They're in
Turbolift Four.

255
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,834
Engaging override
controls now.

256
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,458
They have trapped us.

257
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,542
What deck is this?

258
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,542
We are on deck ten.

259
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,834
Can you move us again?

260
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,417
I know how to override
the Bridge command.

261
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,500
Activate security fields,
decks eight through 15.

262
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,417
(<i> console beeping</i> )

263
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,041
Sir, the turbolift is
moving again.

264
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,458
They're still inside.

265
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,709
Initiate emergency bulkheads
in Turboshaft Four.

266
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,792
Aye, sir.

267
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:06,041
They have been stopped
at deck 13.

268
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,208
Mr. Worf.

269
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,500
Do you know
how to deactivate this?

270
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:43,792
The computer won't allow us
to override

271
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:45,917
an emergency
force field command.

272
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,417
My entity's artificial
substructure may be useful.

273
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,542
They've broken through
a security field.

274
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,667
Deck ten, section two.

275
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:08,625
Security to Ten-Forward!

276
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:12,583
(<i> crying loudly</i> )

277
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,625
(<i> murmuring</i> )

278
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,583
Shh.

279
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,875
Mama's here.

280
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,250
Shh.

281
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:27,417
Everyone, get down
on the floor.

282
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,083
Miles...?

283
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:31,750
Shh...

284
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:33,208
On the floor!

285
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:39,875
Everyone down!

286
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:41,000
Now!

287
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,917
Miles!

288
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:49,208
(<i> grunting</i> )

289
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,041
(<i> grunting</i> )

290
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,291
(<i> Molly crying</i> )

291
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,917
Multiple phaser shots,
Ten-Forward.

292
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,125
Picard to Worf. Report.

293
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,166
Mr. Worf, acknowledge.

294
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,041
Can you hear me, Mr. Worf?

295
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,667
Yes, Bridge.

296
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:21,875
He can hear you.

297
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,250
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

298
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,625
<i>Following an aborted attempt</i>
<i>to take control of the Bridge</i>

299
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,875
<i>Counselor Troi, Mr. Data</i>
<i>and Chief O'Brien</i>

300
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:39,250
<i>have seized Ten-Forward.</i>

301
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,166
Position security teams
at both entrances.
Yes, sir.

302
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,125
Mr. La Forge, shut
down all computer
access to Ten-Forward.

303
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,625
I can't, Captain.

304
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,542
They've already set up
a remote security lockout.

305
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,875
We'd have to shut down
all computer function

306
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,333
in the saucer section.

307
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,959
Transporter Room Three,
can you get a pattern lock

308
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,458
on Commander Data,
Counselor Troi

309
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,291
and Chief O'Brien
in Ten-Forward?

310
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,750
Attempting to lock on, sir.

311
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,625
O'BRIEN:
You are correct.

312
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,667
They're attempting to
engage their transporters

313
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,208
but I know how
to shut them down.

314
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,417
Do it.

315
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,917
Bridge, the entire transporter
array has been taken off-line

316
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,333
and placed into diagnostic mode.

317
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,959
I can't override.

318
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It'll take a couple of hours
to complete the cycle.

319
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,625
How many people
are down there?

320
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,208
Seventeen.

321
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,250
They just shut down the
internal scanners, too, Captain.

322
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,083
Dr. Crusher
to the Bridge.

323
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,875
On my way.

324
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,458
What are you doing now?

325
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,083
I can reverse the polarity
of their force fields

326
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,208
to isolate this room.
Good.

327
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,875
Their communicators.

328
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:43,792
Now they'll learn nothing,
except what we tell them.

329
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,041
They've done something
to the force fields

330
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,417
on deck ten, section one.

331
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,875
Geordi?

332
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,417
I don't recognize
the configurations

333
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,667
but they've completely
isolated Ten-Forward.

334
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:52,750
What about flooding
their air vents

335
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:54,208
with anesthezine gas?

336
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,500
That won't affect Data.

337
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:56,875
No rescue plan will work

338
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:59,000
unless we can knock out
all three of them.

339
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,125
A concussive charge would
blow out the security field

340
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,000
so we can go in
with our phasers on a wide beam.

341
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,542
Stun everybody.
Sort it out later.

342
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,959
Doctor, go back to
the biofilter readouts taken

343
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,792
of the away team's transport
from the moon's surface.

344
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,750
See if you can come up
with any clue

345
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:17,000
that might explain this.

346
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,417
Ten-Forward,
this is Captain Picard.

347
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,166
I am prepared to
discuss this situation.

348
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,709
There is no need
for further violence.

349
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,291
Please identify yourself.

350
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,166
They will now attempt
to negotiate

351
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:38,083
for the safety and
release of their people.

352
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,917
Interesting.

353
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,375
Under normal circumstances

354
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:42,667
I would be counseling
the Captain

355
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:44,125
at a time like this.

356
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,875
What would you tell him
to do?

357
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:49,208
I would help him find a way
to secure our trust.

358
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,542
What are
you looking at?

359
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,458
(<i> Molly crying</i> )

360
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,959
You, Klingon.

361
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,208
Attack me.

362
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,750
(<i> beeping</i> )

363
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,875
Are you afraid?

364
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:20,000
I have no fear of death.

365
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,959
And I have no fear
of killing you.

366
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,375
TROI:
Stop it!

367
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,917
PICARD:
Please respond, Ten-Forward.

368
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:44,458
Are there any members of my crew
who require medical assistance?

369
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,625
We can discuss
your wounded.

370
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,000
But first,
you will move the ship.

371
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,125
Move it where?

372
00:18:55,166 --> 00:19:00,583
You will change orbit to an
inclination of 80 degrees south.

373
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,208
That's the southern
polar region.

374
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,709
That's where Data tried
to move the ship.

375
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,583
And that's what Troi
asked me to do, but why?

376
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,750
Ten-Forward,
if you could be

377
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:10,542
more specific about
our intended destination

378
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,000
then perhaps we could...

379
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,959
You have 30 seconds
to change your heading

380
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,583
or additional members
of your crew

381
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,709
will require medical attention.

382
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:24,250
We need to stabilize
this situation.

383
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,041
Play for time.

384
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,291
I suggest that we move
the ship as they've asked.

385
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,583
Agreed?

386
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,000
Set a new heading.

387
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,375
But take us there
as slowly as you can.

388
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:38,500
Ten-Forward, we are moving
the ship as you requested.

389
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,083
He's telling the truth.

390
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,625
Their heading has changed.

391
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,458
Captain, I've compared
the away team's

392
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,375
last transporter trace patterns
to their earlier records.

393
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:56,917
They're exactly the same

394
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:59,458
except in Data, Troi and O'Brien
there's an unusual

395
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,667
synaptic activity--
some kind of anionic energy.

396
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:04,333
It might be
another life-form

397
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,208
superimposing its neural
patterns on our people.

398
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,083
Why wasn't<i> I</i> affected?

399
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,625
I don't know.

400
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,291
The only difference
between you and the others

401
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,041
is that you were injured.

402
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,625
My broken arm.

403
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,375
CRUSHER:
The fracture caused
pain receptors to fire

404
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:21,041
which may have made you
immune to this energy.

405
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,959
If your theory is
accurate, Doctor

406
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,041
what would happen if we were
to inflict pain on the others?

407
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,458
It might force whatever it is
out of our people.

408
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,583
A plasma shock--
it would be painful

409
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,500
but it wouldn't cause
any physical harm.

410
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,125
I could hook up
a modified laser scanner

411
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,583
to a plasma inverter.

412
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,959
What about Data?

413
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,500
Well, a plasma shock

414
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:40,583
will definitely overload
his neural net.

415
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,125
It'll work on him, too.

416
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,458
We have to find a
way to penetrate

417
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,709
the force field
around Ten-Forward.

418
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,834
I might be able to interrupt

419
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,291
the force field
for a few seconds

420
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,875
but I'll be fighting
the computer for control.

421
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:50,083
Timing will be critical.

422
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,291
RO:
We'd have to hit

423
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,542
all three with a
single discharge.

424
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,583
If they're standing
together

425
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,709
it shouldn't
be a problem.

426
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,125
How will you gain access?

427
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,625
Microoptic drill
through the ceiling

428
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,166
and they'll
never detect it.

429
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,000
If this is going to work,
we have to have some way

430
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,458
to contain or neutralize
this anionic energy

431
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,458
once it's out
of our people.

432
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,667
Yes, Doctor.

433
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:08,458
That will be
your top priority.

434
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Very well.
Proceed.

435
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:12,333
Bridge to Ten-Forward.

436
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,375
Now that we<i> are</i> moving
the ship as you requested

437
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:16,667
I would like to know the
nature of the injuries

438
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,875
to the members
of my crew.

439
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:21,542
Five of your people
have been injured.

440
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,959
How serious is their condition?

441
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,542
You, Klingon, tell him.

442
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,959
Captain, one person has

443
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,583
what looks like
a level-five phaser hit.

444
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,291
And four others
have secondary burns.

445
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,208
They require medical attention.

446
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,500
And our captors are not affected
by a phaser stun...

447
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,959
Silence, Klingon.

448
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,417
Ten-Forward, you must
release these people

449
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,709
so that they can receive
proper medical attention.

450
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,375
I will release no one.

451
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:53,000
If you will release them,
I will take their place.

452
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,875
I don't trust him.

453
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,417
It may be a deception.

454
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:04,792
The crew values Picard's
life above all others.

455
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:09,709
Captain Picard, we
agree to your proposal.

456
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,917
Expect a medical team
to accompany me.

457
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,333
TROI:
Acknowledged.

458
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,750
Sick Bay, this is Picard.

459
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,000
Have an emergency
medical team

460
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,750
meet me outside
Ten-Forward.

461
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:19,000
Sir, putting you down there

462
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,208
only strengthens
their position.

463
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,667
Number One, so long as
they're on board this ship

464
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:26,083
I'm a hostage, no matter
where I am-- we all are.

465
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,125
I must find out who
we're dealing with.

466
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,083
If La Forge and Ro
can attempt a rescue

467
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,208
in short order,
then let them proceed.

468
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,500
If they can't,
I will provide you

469
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:35,667
with another
opportunity.

470
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:36,875
Watch for it.

471
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,208
Yes, sir.

472
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,667
(<i> Molly crying</i> )

473
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:51,458
Shh.

474
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:56,166
Shh!

475
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,792
Silence that child!

476
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,417
Shh!

477
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,875
(<i> crying continues</i> )

478
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:03,500
Shh!

479
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,750
Shh!

480
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,000
I know you.

481
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:18,750
I know who you are.

482
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,959
And I know what this is.

483
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,750
She's frightened.

484
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,792
Why don't you just
let us go?

485
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:33,417
Shh!

486
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,583
No.

487
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,125
Make it stop!

488
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,083
Shh!

489
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,125
PICARD:
Ten-Forward

490
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,125
we're outside the door.

491
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,792
Lower the force field.

492
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,083
Welcome, Captain.

493
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:02,208
Allow me to
introduce myself.

494
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,959
I am Captain Bryce Shumar

495
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,959
of the Federation
Starship<i> Essex.</i>

496
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:17,500
The Starship<i> Essex</i> vanished
over 200 years ago.

497
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:21,625
Indeed. I know.
I was there.

498
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:25,375
This is my First Officer,
Commander Steven Mullen

499
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:28,208
and my Security Chief,
Lieutenant Morgan Kelly.

500
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:38,583
And you have survived
all this time as...

501
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:42,041
Spirits? Ghosts?

502
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,083
But you're a man who would never
believe in ghosts, Picard.

503
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,417
Isn't that true?

504
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,959
You see,
Troi knows you

505
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,208
and so I do, as well.

506
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,792
Then Counselor Troi
is still alive?

507
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,750
Yes, of course, she is.

508
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:58,792
I have no wish to harm her
or to harm anyone else.

509
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,375
I'm very pleased
to hear that.

510
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,417
We have been forced
to take this action, Captain

511
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,875
because we need your help.

512
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:07,667
My help?

513
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,834
Our consciousness
has been trapped on this moon

514
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,041
for two centuries.

515
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,792
We must escape this torture.

516
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,500
How did this happen to you?

517
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,458
I can't explain
how it happened.

518
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,917
I only know that it did.

519
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:30,125
The<i> Essex</i> was caught
in an electromagnetic storm

520
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,917
just as your shuttle was.

521
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,291
Moments before we crashed

522
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,917
the Bridge was struck
by lightning.

523
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:41,125
The ship was ripped apart.

524
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:45,375
Somehow, in that instant,
our consciousness was absorbed

525
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:47,792
into the magnetic currents
on the surface.

526
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,291
Why didn't you tell us this?

527
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,208
Why the deception?

528
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,750
The violence?

529
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:59,208
Because, as I said

530
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,458
I knew
you would not believe us.

531
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,375
Even now, I know you don't.

532
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:08,250
What was your
vessel's designation

533
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,709
and its complement?

534
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,250
NCC-173.

535
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:14,041
Daedalus-class starship.

536
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,250
Crew-- 229.

537
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,792
Under whose command
in this sector?

538
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:20,959
Admiral Uttan Narsu,
Starbase 12.

539
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,542
You will find all this
in Starfleet records.

540
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,500
I don't need to
see the records.

541
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:28,291
Then you know I am correct.

542
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:36,333
End this, and I will give
you whatever help you need.

543
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:41,709
No.

544
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,125
You don't trust us

545
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:46,875
and I can't risk trusting you.

546
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,250
It is taking too long.

547
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,834
We should have been there
by now.

548
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,667
He is manipulating you.

549
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:55,917
Captain Picard has every right
to be curious.

550
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:58,500
He will delay until
a rescue attempt is possible.

551
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,458
I know that.

552
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,834
I also know
that he will make every effort

553
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:08,208
to protect the lives
of his people.

554
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,709
Since our demands are
not excessive, Captain

555
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,834
I hope you will see that
it will be simpler to accede

556
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:19,750
than to risk further injuries.

557
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:21,250
What do you want?

558
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:26,625
All you need to know for now
is that we want to rest.

559
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:30,709
Simply, finally, to rest.

560
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:38,458
Section two...

561
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,041
"B."

562
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,041
"A."

563
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,041
Section one.

564
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,709
Finally.

565
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,417
I never want to see this part
of the<i> Enterprise</i> again.

566
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:51,917
I hear you-- this is

567
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:56,625
what starship designers
call "easy access."

568
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:59,375
Yeah. Yeah, this is it.

569
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:00,625
I thought we might
have a problem

570
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,583
with conduit number 227

571
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:04,917
but it looks like
we're going to be able

572
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:06,250
to get by it.

573
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,959
(<i> groans</i> )

574
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,417
Thanks.

575
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,875
We're through.

576
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:34,500
Good.

577
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:36,375
Let's hook up the scanner
and see what we've got.

578
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:47,458
Got it.

579
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,375
All three have got to be
in the circle

580
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,417
if this is going to work.

581
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,917
We're halfway home.

582
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:55,166
(<i> quietly</i> ):
La Forge to Crusher.

583
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,875
How are you doing?

584
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:58,959
I think I've come up with
an idea for a containment field.

585
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,750
This anionic energy seems
to be vulnerable

586
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:02,375
to the same magnetic
flux density

587
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:04,208
we monitored in the storms.

588
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,875
If we can duplicate it,
we can trap it

589
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,625
once it's out of our people.

590
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,166
Well, you should
be able to do that

591
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,750
by flooding Ten-Forward
with ionogenic particles.

592
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,667
Exactly what I was thinking.

593
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:16,333
RIKER:
Geordi, how long will it take
to get it all ready?

594
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:21,083
Uh, we still have to calibrate
the plasma inverter, Commander.

595
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,458
My guess is 45 minutes
to an hour.

596
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
I can have the containment field
ready by then.

597
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:26,583
Keep me advised.

598
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,959
Watch the Klingon.

599
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,375
I will.

600
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:34,375
Leave us.

601
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:36,834
He's confused.

602
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,542
Impressions,
Mr. Worf.

603
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:43,291
Spiritual possessions
of this sort have been reported

604
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,667
throughout Klingon history.

605
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:47,834
It is called<i> Jat'yIn--</i>

606
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,959
the taking of the living
by the dead.

607
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,792
Human history is full
of many similar legends.

608
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:57,083
Then<i> you</i> believe
they may be telling the truth?

609
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,250
We need
to maintain control...

610
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:00,875
Not for one moment.

611
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:03,709
Sir, they know much
about the<i> Essex.</i>

612
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,625
If it<i> is</i> the spirit
of Captain Shumar...

613
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:06,834
Then he should
be behaving

614
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,917
very much better,
don't you think?

615
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,208
A Starfleet Captain?

616
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,250
O'BRIEN:
You two, sit down.

617
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:13,500
Hey, right!

618
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:16,750
Living disembodied
for two centuries--

619
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:18,125
perhaps they've gone mad.

620
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,417
I assure you,
Mr. Worf

621
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,542
these are
not<i> Jat'yIn.</i>

622
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:25,083
Our job is to find out
exactly what they<i> are</i>

623
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,542
and then to determine
how to deal with...

624
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,250
All right, that's enough.

625
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,333
Stop, both of you.

626
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,750
You over there, you there.

627
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:32,875
Down!

628
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:34,250
O'BRIEN:
I gave you that.

629
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,834
(<i> Molly cries</i> )

630
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:45,125
In a place called
McKinley Park.

631
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,583
Green grass...

632
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,083
tall trees.

633
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,542
Please don't.

634
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,166
I hid the bracelet
in your pocket.

635
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,667
You were... surprised.

636
00:30:54,709 --> 00:30:55,917
Don't.

637
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:57,542
(<i> crying continues</i> )

638
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:01,750
You said, "Miles,
you make me feel so happy."

639
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:11,000
No! Get away!
Get away from me!

640
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,500
TROI:
Leave her alone.

641
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,458
(<i> crying continues</i> )

642
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:25,458
PICARD:
Captain Shumar?

643
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,333
We'll be approaching
the southern polar region

644
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,875
that you've requested
in a few minutes.

645
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:31,625
I need to give
additional instructions.

646
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:33,834
Very well.

647
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,542
We're taking you
to our crash site.

648
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,250
At the southern pole.

649
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:41,417
That is correct.

650
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,208
Nothing our sensors
were able to detect

651
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,083
indicated that the<i> Essex</i>
went down in that region.

652
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,333
As I told you, Captain

653
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:51,458
the ship broke up
in the atmosphere

654
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,417
and the Bridge went down here.

655
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:55,959
When we reach it

656
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
you will beam what's left
of our skeletal remains

657
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,875
on board this ship,
and then take them

658
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:03,875
back to Earth,
for a proper burial.

659
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:08,333
You see how simple a request
this is?

660
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:09,667
Captain...

661
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:15,375
If you will let
these people go

662
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:18,333
I'll order the Bridge to
follow your instructions.

663
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,709
I will release no one.

664
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,667
If you are who you say you are,
there's no need for any of this.

665
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,166
We'll gladly take you home.

666
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:30,208
I wish you were truly as
open-minded as you say, Picard.

667
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,333
If you don't release
the hostages

668
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:32,792
I won't cooperate.

669
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:35,166
Oh, you will cooperate,
Captain.

670
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:38,667
You will cooperate,
or someone will die.

671
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:40,917
Who shall
it be, huh?

672
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,542
How about the Klingon?

673
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,333
Get another one.

674
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,000
You.

675
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,750
Come on.

676
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,583
Come on. Come on.

677
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,458
Pick one to die, Captain...

678
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,250
or I kill them both.

679
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:09,000

They're all in range.

681
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,083
I have to do it now.

682
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,667
I'm only going to be able
to shut down the force field

683
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:19,083
for about seven seconds
before the computer compensates.

684
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,500
Well, if they're the
right seven seconds,
it'll be enough.

685
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:25,500
LA FORGE:
Bridge, prepare to release the
ionogenic field on my signal.

686
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,041
Standing by.

687
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,041
Ready?

688
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,125
Kill the force field.

689
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,375
Force field down.

Damn!

693
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,625
Tell them to stop,
or I kill everyone

694
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:46,917
in this room,
starting with you.

695
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,667
Picard to Bridge!

696
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:53,875
Abort immediately!

697
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,834
As you say, Captain.

698
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,291
Riker to La Forge.

699
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,083
Return to the Bridge.

701
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,333
Are you ready to cooperate?

702
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:27,583
Yes.

Intense storm activity

is making it
virtually impossible

715
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:13,000
for us to pick up
any trace of the<i> Essex.</i>

716
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,667
We are giving you
the exact coordinates

717
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:17,667
of our remains on board
the wreck of the<i> Essex.</i>

718
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:25,333
Receiving those
coordinates now.

719
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,834
Can you tell what's there?

720
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,208
Just your basic
ionic cyclone.

721
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,875
I can't read a thing.

722
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:32,333
Well, I'm sure as hell
not going to beam up

723
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:33,750
whatever<i> might</i> be
down there.

724
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:35,125
I've got a good
excuse for you.

725
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,333
The transporters
aren't going to work

726
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,000
any better than
the scanners.

727
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:40,333
Bridge to Ten-Forward.

728
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,083
Whatever's blocking
our scanners

729
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,917
will prevent
the use of the transporters.

730
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,291
They're lying!

731
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,792
On the contrary.
We've had a difficult time

732
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:48,542
with the transporters
since we arrived here.

733
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,208
That's why we had to send down
the shuttle.

734
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,667
You should all have been
aware of that fact.

735
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:54,208
We must be able
to use the transporters.

736
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,083
Mr. O'Brien was the one
who safely executed

737
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,959
the return of
the away team.

738
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,875
He's the most qualified person
on board to operate

739
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:04,000
the transporters
under these circumstances.

740
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:05,375
Can you do it
from here?

741
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:08,125
No. We'll have to use
the transporter pad.

742
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,542
I could...

743
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:13,000
I could give you
safe passage

744
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:16,500
to a transporter pad
in one of the cargo bays.

745
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,083
It is a trick.

746
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,750
He is trying to divide us.

747
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,875
We must not
be separated.

748
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:23,959
I could give you all
safe passage.

749
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,333
Why are you suddenly
being so helpful?

750
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:27,834
Because I assume
that if you choose

751
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,834
to go to the cargo bay

752
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,917
then you won't take
all of the hostages.

753
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:34,667
Their safety is
my chief priority.

754
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:37,750
What are the risks
when we leave this room?

755
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:39,125
Without the protection
of the force fields

756
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,917
we are completely vulnerable.

757
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:43,083
They could use the transporter
against us.

758
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:44,542
Once the force field is down

759
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,542
they could beam us
back to the surface.

760
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,291
But there is a way
to neutralize that threat.

761
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:53,959
Bridge...

762
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,291
transfer all transporter
functions to Ten-Forward.

763
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:58,875
RIKER:
In order to do that

764
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:02,250
you will have to release
your computer control lockouts.

765
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:03,875
That's not true.

766
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,208
Let me talk to him.

767
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:09,875
Number One, I think
we have an opportunity

768
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:11,750
to end this siege.

769
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:15,125
It will require the cooperation
of all concerned.

770
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,917
Our... guests will
be moving shortly

771
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,959
to Cargo Bay Four

772
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,625
where the transport
will occur.

773
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,583
I want you to ensure
them of safe passage

774
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:29,500
between Ten-Forward
and the Cargo Bay.

775
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:31,417
Understood, Captain.

776
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,041
Doctor...

777
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,041
Mr. La Forge...

778
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,583
Yes, sir.

779
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,000
Transporter controls
are being transferred.

780
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,500
Ten-Forward to Bridge.

781
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:46,333
I said
<i>all</i> transporter controls!

782
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,959
Including all those

783
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
aboard your shuttlecraft.

784
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,083
Almost had them, Ensign.

785
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

786
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,667
Nice try.

787
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:56,333
Riker to Ten-Forward.

788
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,667
Remaining transporter
functions are being

789
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:58,875
transferred to you.

790
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:05,333
Once we create
our own access code

791
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:07,583
we can prevent anybody using
the transporter against us

792
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:09,083
as we go to the cargo bay.

793
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,792
What about the weapons?

794
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,125
We will each
take a hostage...

795
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,625
for protection.

796
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,000
Klingon.

797
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,750
Picard, you are mine.

798
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:25,875
(<i> Molly crying</i> )

799
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,333
Please, let her stay.

800
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,583
Lower the force field.

801
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,250
Security teams, stand by.

802
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:43,917
They're heading
through section five.

803
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,250
Mr. La Forge,
Doctor, they'll be

804
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:11,583
at their destination
in less than a minute.

805
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:13,333
They've stopped
at deck 18, sir.

806
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,333
Security, allow them
access into Cargo Bay Four.

807
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:16,291
CREWMAN:
Aye, sir.

808
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:21,417
I will require
assistance.

809
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,041
Captain Shumar...

810
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:30,166
how do you intend to achieve

811
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:33,542
this "rest" that you so desire?

812
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:34,834
What do you mean?

813
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,667
Well, how do
you intend

814
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:39,625
to free yourselves
of this existence

815
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:42,166
that has so trapped
your consciousness?

816
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:44,959
It will fade as we move
further from this planet.

817
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Really? And what is
your scientific basis for that?

818
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:51,250
I don't need a scientific basis.

819
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,041
Just be quiet.

820
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,333
Captain Shumar,
when are you going

821
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:57,041
to tell me who you<i> really</i> are?

822
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:00,083
I've initialized the
transporter signal.

823
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:02,583
Proceed.

824
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:08,667
They're firing up
the transporter,
Commander.

825
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:09,959
Mr. La Forge?

826
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,417
I've isolated
Cargo Bay Four

827
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:12,959
with a neutrino
field, sir

828
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,208
but it will
only take Data

829
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,750
and O'Brien a
couple of minutes

830
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:17,667
to override it once they
discover that it's there.

831
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:18,917
I hope that'll give
the Captain

832
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,375
enough time
to play his hand.

833
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:22,333
Do you know what
he's going to do?

834
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,375
There's only
one reason

835
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:25,834
he chose
Cargo Bay Four.

836
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,375
If it becomes
necessary, Ensign

837
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:29,750
you'll blow
the cargo bay hatch

838
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:32,208
on my orders.

839
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,500
Yes, sir.

840
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:45,709
TROI:
You're right, Picard.

841
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,375
It's not rest we seek,
only escape.

842
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:50,917
Escape?

843
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:52,250
We were brought
to this moon

844
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,750
over five centuries ago

845
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:57,917
from a star system
called Ux-Mal.

846
00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,709
We were separated
from our bodies

847
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,875
and left to drift
in the storms.

848
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:06,709
Once, we almost escaped--
on board the<i> Essex.</i>

849
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,792
But that ship

850
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:09,083
was incapable
of eluding

851
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:11,375
this moon's
electromagnetic storms.

852
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:12,667
You really think
that using

853
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:14,959
their identities
would gain our sympathy?

854
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,834
It was a better approach
than asking you

855
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:21,500
to allow hundreds
of condemned prisoners on board.

856
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:24,542
Then this moon
is a penal colony.

857
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:27,792
That's correct.

858
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:30,500
But now, we have your ship
and your bodies

859
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,000
to carry us home.

860
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,166
I'm reading dozens
of them-- hundreds.

861
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,709
They have the same
anionic signature

862
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,000
we saw on the biofilter scans.

863
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,542
I think we can give
the Captain

864
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,125
a new bargaining chip.

865
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,458
Dr. Crusher,
flood the cargo bay

866
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,834
with your
containment field.

867
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:57,375
No!

868
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:59,709
Let them go,
or you will all die!

869
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,458
Your threats are
meaningless now.

870
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,458
We are still in
control of these
three bodies.

871
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,417
We will not
let them go.

872
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:07,458
Are you prepared to
sacrifice the lives
of these others?

873
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,750
They'll all die
when the cargo
bay hatch is blown.

874
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:11,875
You will die,
too, Picard.

875
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:13,083
I would die to save

876
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,875
the life of my child.

877
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:16,792
To die
defending one's ship

878
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,709
is the hope
of every Klingon.

879
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,333
If you each know the
officers you inhabit

880
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,709
then you know
they are equally ready

881
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,709
to give their lives
for this ship.

882
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,709
Free them now

883
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,667
and I will return you
to the moon's surface.

884
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,083
I advise you, Picard,
not to pass our way again.

885
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:51,875
Picard to Bridge.

886
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:53,166
RIKER:
Aye, sir.

887
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,583
Our guests will be
leaving shortly.

888
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,709
I need an emergency
medical team down here.

889
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,458
CRUSHER:
On our way, Captain.

890
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,291
Mr. Worf, prepare to
transport these prisoners

891
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:06,041
down to the
moon's surface.

892
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,375
Gladly, sir.

893
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,458
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45572.1.</i>

894
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,750
<i>Dr. Crusher has examined Troi,</i>
<i>Data and O'Brien.</i>

895
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:24,333
<i>There seem to be</i>
<i>no residual effects</i>

896
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:26,500
<i>from their experience.</i>

897
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:28,041
It was as though
my own consciousness

898
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,041
were pushed to the side.

899
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,667
I was watching
everything happen--

900
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,083
hearing my own voice--

901
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:35,375
but not being able
to control any of it.

902
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:37,250
What about the entity
that controlled you?

903
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:38,834
What were your perceptions
of him?

904
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:40,041
(<i> sighing</i> )

905
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,792
He was intelligent,
actually.

906
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:45,875
Thoughtful, in a
ruthless kind of way.

907
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:47,375
Cold.

908
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,333
Lieutenant,
I must apologize

909
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,375
for my inadvertent
misconduct toward you.

910
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:52,875
No apology necessary.

911
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:55,542
Your restraint was
most remarkable.

912
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:56,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

913
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:59,667
You have no idea.

914
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:01,375
How do you feel?

915
00:44:01,417 --> 00:44:02,709
Hungry.

916
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,125
That's a good sign.

917
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:07,333
Go home.

918
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:11,625
How do<i> you</i> feel?

919
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:14,875
I'm just glad
to have you back.

920
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:17,542
If I could have killed
that thing inside me...

921
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:18,542
I would have.

922
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,125
I know.

923
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,166
We both know.

924
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,667
(<i> chuckles</i> )

925
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:24,208
(<i> cooing</i> )
