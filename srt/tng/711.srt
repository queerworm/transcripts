00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:12,250
Personal Log,
Stardate 47391.2.

2
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:16,125
I am returning from the<i> Bat'leth</i>
competition on Forcas III.

3
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,583
The conditions were
difficult.

4
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:23,208
Several contestants were maimed,
but I was triumphant.

5
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:27,750
I won
champion standing.

6
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,625
I am looking forward
to resuming my duties

7
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:32,709
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,208
However...

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,166
I am anticipating
a troubling situation.

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,583
It looks like we're
going to have to head

11
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,291
into the Argus Array.

12
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,667
This is the third time
this year

13
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,500
it's stopped
relaying data.

14
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:48,917
Starfleet's beginning
to think that it's more

15
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:51,792
than a simple
malfunction.

16
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:54,750
I want you to start
a long-range scan once we get...

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,041
Lieutenant,
are you listening to me?

18
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,333
Hmm? Yes, sir.

19
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:05,291
You seem awfully tense
for a man who just

20
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,917
came back
from vacation.

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,875
Today is my... birthday.

22
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:29,709
What's the matter
with you?

23
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,291
Because it is
my birthday,

24
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,667
I assumed that you
or one of the others

25
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,792
would try to mount
an unexpected

26
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:39,542
social gathering.

27
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,667
A surprise party?

28
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,625
Mr. Worf,
I hate surprise parties.

29
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:45,583
I would never
do that to you.

30
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,000
I am sorry,
Commander.

31
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,417
Settle in.
I'll meet you on the bridge.

32
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,792
Aye, sir.

33
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,625
ALL:
Surprise!

34
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,458
(<i> noisemakers popping</i> )

35
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,750
I love
surprise parties.

36
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,834
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

37
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,583

It wasn't easy

00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,041
There doesn't seem to be

52
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,250
It's traditional
for the birthday boy

to cut the cake.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,959
Captain Picard sends
his birthday wishes.

He was needed

Happy Birthday, Worf.

57
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,458
Thank you.

58
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,375
Ah...

59
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,458
A painting.

60
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,083
Yes, I have entered
my expressionist phase.

61
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,375
This is my interpretation
of the Battle of<i> Haros.</i>

62
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,792
The Battle of<i> Haros.</i>

63
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:19,250
I think
it's wonderful,

64
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,583
and I know just
where to put it.

65
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,792
What are you doing?

66
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,500
I always thought
this room could use

67
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,083
a little more color.

68
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,375
Nice. The Battle
of<i> Haros,</i> right?

69
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,375
Worf,
are you all right?

70
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,792
Yes... yes,
I think

71
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,625
Data's painting is
making me dizzy.

72
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:43,959
DR. CRUSHER :
Some cake?

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,166
Oh, thank you,
Doctor.

74
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,208
I... I thought
the cake was chocolate.

75
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,959
Don't I wish.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,291
This is from Alexander.

77
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,667
He gave it to me
just before he left

78
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:55,709
to visit your parents.

79
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,375
Thank you.

80
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,166
What is it, Worf?

81
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,625
It's a cast of
Alexander's forehead--

82
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:07,166
the ridges
of a warrior.

83
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,583
TROI:
He wished he could
have been here

84
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,667
when you got back
from shore leave.

85
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:12,083
You should have
seen him, Worf.

86
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,500
He stayed up all night

87
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:16,166
talking about how proud
he was of his father.

88
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,834
Thank you for watching him
while I was away.

89
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,250
Oh, it was
my pleasure.

90
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,709
PICARD:
So, how old are you,
Mr. Worf?

91
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,959
Captain... I was told
you could not attend.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,041
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

93
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,333
How old are you?

94
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,417
I am...

95
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,875
Old enough.

96
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:38,625
(<i> laughing</i> )

97
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,917
Report.

98
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,291
The array appears to be
functioning normally, sir.

99
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,333
That can't be right.

100
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,083
We were told the array
stopped relaying data

101
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,667
six days ago.

102
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,500
The array is still
transmitting data, sir,

103
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,333
but it is no longer
sending that information

104
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,750
to the Federation.

105
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,333
It appears someone
has redirected

106
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,041
its imaging systems.

107
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,208
Where is the information
being sent now?

108
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,291
Sector 19658, sir.

109
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,125
I am unable to access
its main computer

110
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,709
so it is impossible
to determine

111
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,125
its exact location.

112
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,166
What's in that sector?

113
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,333
It is uninhabited,
but there could be

114
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,667
a ship or a subspace relay
station receiving the data.

115
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:27,083
Captain , I suggest we beam
a repair team aboard the Array.

116
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,083
We can begin downloading
their imaging logs,

117
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,667
find out what
the Array's been observing

118
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:31,875
for the past six days.

119
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,500
Make it so.

120
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:34,917
Mr. Data...

121
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,709
(<i> quiet conversation</i> )

122
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,333
Excuse me,
Counselor.

123
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,583
Do you have
a moment?

124
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,000
Of course.

125
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:00,208
I have been meaning to speak
with you about Alexander.

126
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,333
Oh?
It has never
been easy for me

127
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,542
having Alexander
on board.

128
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,333
I have tried to be
a good father,

129
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,917
to give him guidance,

130
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,875
but he seems to have
his own mind about some things.

131
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:14,417
Most children do.

132
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,417
I could not have come
this far without your help,

133
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,083
and Alexander
looks up to you.

134
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,250
At times, I have felt that
you were like a mother to him.

135
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,333
Worf, that's one
of the nicest things

136
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,166
anyone's ever said to me.

137
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,000
One time, when I thought
I was going to die,

138
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,583
I asked you
to watch over Alexander.

139
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,709
I was wondering
if you would consider

140
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,834
formalizing
that arrangement.

141
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:44,375
I want you to be
Alexander's<i> soh-chlm.</i>

142
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:48,417
His...<i> soh-chlm?</i>

143
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,625
You would become
his surrogate mother.

144
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,959
In case anything ever
happened to me,

145
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,083
you would be
responsible for him.

146
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,333
I don't know
what to say.

147
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:01,291
It's a great honor.

148
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:07,458
So, um, that would
make me your...

149
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,750
The closest analogy
is... stepsister.

150
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:18,250
That would make my mother
your stepmother.

151
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,625
I had not
considered that.

152
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,208
It is a risk
I am willing to take.

153
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,917
I accept.

154
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,375
DATA:
Lieutenant Worf,

155
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,792
please report
to Engineering.

156
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:37,458
I am on my way.

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We have analyzed
the imaging logs.

158
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,625
It appears the Array
was reprogrammed

159
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,875
to observe several
Federation sites.

160
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:54,834
This is Deep Space 5,
Starbase 47,

161
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,583
the Iadara colony,

162
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,959
and the Utopia
Planitia shipyards.

163
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,500
They're responsible for
new starship development.

164
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,041
WORF:
Someone is
using the array

165
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,208
for covert surveillance
of the Federation.

166
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,583
That is our theory.

167
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,333
We believe
unauthorized access

168
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,458
was made six days ago.

169
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,458
The imaging logs
from that day

170
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,417
show a ship
approaching the array.

171
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,083
That is a Cardassian
ship, Galor-class.

172
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,000
We're only three light-years
from Cardassian space.

173
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,583
They would have easy
access to the array.

174
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,750
Mr. Worf, start

175
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,083
a long-range scan
of the region.

176
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,166
See if there are any
Cardassian ships nearby.

177
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,375
Aye, sir.

178
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:31,000
Worf, here's a propulsion
analysis

179
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,709
of the Cardassian
vessel.

180
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,542
You might try
scanning for its
energy configuration.

181
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,959
Lieutenant,
are you all right?

182
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,959
I feel dizzy.

183
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,500
Worf, you don't look
so good.

184
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:53,291
Maybe you ought
to go to Sick Bay.

185
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,625
Yes... yes,
perhaps I will.

186
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,792
Any nausea or
blurred vision?

187
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,208
No.

188
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,875
However, I did experience

189
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:18,500
some dizziness earlier today
at my birthday celebration.

190
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,500
Sounds like you're having
some of the side effects

191
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:21,834
from the concussion.

192
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,625
I can give you
some vertazine

193
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:24,834
for the dizziness,

194
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,333
but I'd like you to rest.

195
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,458
Doctor, perhaps
you are thinking

196
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,792
of another patient.

197
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,250
I have no concussion.

198
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,542
Worf, you came in here
this morning

199
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,625
complaining
of ringing in your ears.

200
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:39,250
I scanned you.
You had a concussion.

201
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,959
You don't remember
any of this?

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,667
No.

203
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:45,458
Temporary memory loss

204
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
is common for
this kind of injury.

205
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,667
Do you remember telling me
about the<i> Bat'leth</i> tournament?

206
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,041
You said that one
of the competitors

207
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,583
hit you over the head.

208
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,959
That's why you lost
the match.

209
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,834
I won that tournament,
and I can prove it to you!

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,125
What's wrong?

211
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,625
It says "ninth place."

212
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,667
This is not
the same trophy.

213
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:30,083
Someone is playing
a trick on me.

214
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,500
Worf, try to stay calm.

215
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,583
Memory loss can be
very disorienting.

216
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,917
The log...

217
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,583
I recorded a personal log

218
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,000
on my way back
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

219
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:45,959
Computer, access personal logs
on shuttlecraft<i> Curie.</i>

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,709
Show my log entry
for Stardate 47391.2.

221
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,500
Personal log, Stardate 47391.2.

222
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:58,792
I am returning from the<i> Bat'leth</i>
competition on Forcas III.

223
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:00,625
The conditions were difficult.

224
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,875
Several contenders were maimed.

225
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,417
One of the contenders used
an illegal<i> t'gha</i> maneuver on me.

226
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,375
The judges chose to ignore it

227
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:13,041
and I was robbed
of my rightful standing.

228
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,166
I was awarded ninth place.

229
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,834
I am looking forward

230
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,250
to resuming my duties
aboard the<i> En...</i>

231
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,583
(<i> stops playback</i> )

232
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,417
I do not understand.

233
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,625
Worf, I'm sure

234
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:32,083
this is very
disturbing for you

235
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,375
but don't worry.

236
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:35,458
Your memories
will return.

237
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,041
Now, the best thing you
could do right now

238
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,458
is to settle back into
your normal routine,

239
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,250
but slowly.

240
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,542
Thank you, Doctor.

241
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,750
Let me know if you have

242
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,417
any more problems
with dizziness.

243
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,166
I'll give you
a hypospray.

244
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:09,667
Lieutenant...

245
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,250
Have you completed

246
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,583
the metallurgical scan
of the array?

247
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,625
Sir?

248
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,291
The metallurgical scan.

249
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,750
Have you completed it?

250
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,583
I do not remember
you asking me to...

251
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,417
(<i> beeping</i> )

252
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,125
Captain, there's a Cardassian
ship approaching--

253
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,458
Galor-class.

254
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,083
Open a channel.

255
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,917
On screen.

256
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,500
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

257
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,417
You are in Federation territory.

258
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,375
Please explain
your presence.

259
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,834
We were wondering

260
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,834
the same thing
about you, Captain.

261
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,917
Why would Starfleet's flagship
want to venture so close

262
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,834
to the Cardassian border?

263
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,750
We are repairing
one of our subspace telescopes.

264
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:53,709
I see.

265
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,000
May we offer our assistance?

266
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,125
No, thank you.

267
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,750
Everything is under control.

268
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:01,166
If you don't mind my asking,

269
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:05,792
what exactly is this telescope
of yours designed to do?

270
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:08,667
PICARD:
It is a long-range
subspace array.

271
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,250
We use it for gathering data
on astronomical phenomena.

272
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,166
I'm certain
it would never be used

273
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,875
to observe
a neighboring species.

274
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,750
Certainly not.

275
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:23,667
Well, then,
best of luck with your repairs.

276
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:26,000
Just try to make certain

277
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:30,792
that your studies are limited
to astronomical phenomena.

278
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,875
Charming fellow.

279
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:36,542
Captain,
that ship was responsible

280
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,667
for reprogramming
the array.

281
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,250
What are you saying?

282
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,125
It is the same class
and energy configuration

283
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,000
as the ship we saw
in the imaging logs.

284
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,875
The imaging logs?

285
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:50,834
Are you suggesting
that you have evidence

286
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,834
that the Cardassians
have tampered with the array?

287
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,583
They are using the array
as a surveillance device.

288
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,000
You saw the logs yourself.

289
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,500
I haven't heard
anything about this.

290
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:03,000
Neither have I.

291
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,750
Commander Data,
show them the logs

292
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:08,041
you downloaded from the array.

293
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,083
I know of no such logs.

294
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:14,333
Mr. Worf, are you
feeling all right?

295
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,750
Yes.

296
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:18,166
Mr. Data, perhaps you

297
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,500
had better reexamine
the array.

298
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:22,041
See if you can find
any evidence

299
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,583
to support
Mr. Worf's claims.

300
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,125
WORF:
Dr. Crusher says

301
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,709
I am experiencing
further memory loss,

302
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,458
but my instincts tell me
it is more than that.

303
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,959
I remember
those imaging logs.

304
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,834
I could tell you every
detail, every word!

305
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,834
Worf, let's assume for
a second you're right--

306
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,834
that things did happen
as you remember them.

307
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,875
Are you saying
that everyone's
memory on this ship

308
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,208
has been altered
but yours?

309
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,917
(<i> door chimes</i> )

310
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,250
Enter.

311
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,750
Counselor.

312
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:56,250
Worf, I wanted you to know

313
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,583
that we reexamined
the imaging logs.

314
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,625
They don't show
a Cardassian ship

315
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,750
or any evidence
that the array

316
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,250
was reprogrammed.

317
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,709
From what we can tell,

318
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,625
the array suffered
a simple mechanical failure.

319
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,375
That is not right!

320
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,291
I was certain that...

321
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,583
What's wrong?

322
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,917
Counselor,
the painting

323
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:33,041
that Commander Data gave me...

324
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,709
it has moved.

325
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,000
Worf, I hung
that painting there...

326
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,208
at your birthday party,
remember?

327
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,041
No...

328
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,709
The painting has changed.

329
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,750
Don't you see it?

330
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:50,041
Your hair, and
your clothing...

331
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,333
they have changed as well!

332
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,625
Worf, maybe you should come
with me to Sick Bay and...

333
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:57,959
Now, Mr. Worf.

334
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,166
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

335
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,250
Now!

336
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,583
What are you waiting for?
Raise the shields!

337
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,709
This panel configuration
has been altered.

338
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,458
I do not know how...

00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:46,375
They're returning fire.

No, sir.

They destroyed it, sir.

00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:17,750
with plasma burns.

362
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:20,875
There's serious damage
to the secondary plasma conduit,

363
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,375
but I think we've got it
under control.

364
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:23,625
Acknowledged.

365
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:26,000
Ensign, lay in a course
to Starbase 129.

366
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,250
Aye, sir.

367
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,000
What happened back there,
Mr. Worf?

368
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,750
I believe I experienced
another memory loss.

369
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:36,875
RIKER: Memory loss?

370
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:40,583
What are you
talking about?

371
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,417
I do not feel well.

372
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,834
Request permission

373
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,291
to be temporarily
relieved of duty, sir.

374
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,625
Granted.

375
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:26,291
Computer, access personal logs
on shuttlecraft<i> Curie.</i>

376
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:30,083
Play log entry
for Stardate 47391.2.

377
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,667
COMPUTER: There is no log entry

378
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:34,208
from the shuttlecraft<i> Curie</i> 
for that Stardate.

379
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:38,000
Computer,
display<i> any</i> log entries

380
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:42,625
concerning the<i> Bat'leth</i> 
tournament on Forcas III.

381
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:46,917
Personal log, Stardate 47391.2.

382
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:50,083
There has been a malfunction
in the ship's main deflector.

383
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,166
It will require
two more days of repairs.

384
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,083
As a result,
I will not be able to compete

385
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,750
in the<i> Bat'leth</i> tournament
on Forcas III.

386
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:02,125
I have asked my brother
to take my place.

387
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,417
He does not have my prowess
with the blade, but...

388
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,834
(<i> stops playback</i> )

389
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,959
(<i> door chimes</i> )

390
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,542
Why did you
lock the door?

391
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,834
Why shouldn't I?

392
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,208
I heard what happened
on the Bridge.

393
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,875
Are you all right?

394
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,542
I am not sure.

395
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,000
Do you want
to talk about it?

396
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,709
I would rather not,
Counselor.

397
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,417
Very well...<i> Lieutenant.</i>

398
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,000
Hot chocolate.

399
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,417
Is there something
I can do for you?

400
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,250
Actually, there is.

401
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,834
Come and sit down.

402
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:23,375
I just want you
to relax for a minute.

403
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

404
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,750
There.

405
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:42,041
You are so tense.

406
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,041
Now, I know you
don't want to talk

407
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,583
about what happened
on the bridge,

408
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,917
but there are times

409
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:53,041
when it's just best
to let things out.

410
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:56,917
Come on.

411
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:01,125
If you can't talk to me,
who can you talk to, hmm?

412
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,500
Agh!

413
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:06,250
I do not believe
this is appropriate behavior.

414
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,041
Even for your wife?

415
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,083
Wife?!

416
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Worf, what's wrong?

417
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:20,792
I do not know.

418
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,542
Things are changing.

419
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,000
What's changed?

420
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:32,375
I do not remember us--
you and I-- being mates.

421
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:35,417
It is as if events
and circumstances

422
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,041
continue to change

423
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,583
from moment
to moment,

424
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,542
but I am the only one

425
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,166
who seems to be
aware of it.

426
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,500
Are you saying
you don't remember

427
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,875
the last three years?

428
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:50,583
You don't remember us
falling in love

429
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,375
and getting married?

430
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:55,917
I do remember
the last three years,

431
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,917
but they were different.

432
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:02,000
We did not have
<i>this</i> relationship.

433
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,417
We were friends.

434
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,000
And the<i> Enterprise</i> 
did not have

435
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,417
a battle with
the Cardassians.

436
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:14,250
And no one believes me.

437
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,500
(<i> sighs</i> )

438
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,542
Whatever's wrong...

439
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,709
whatever happened...

440
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,250
I want you to know

441
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,625
that<i> I</i> believe you

442
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:28,000
and that I love you.

443
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:31,500
And together, we'll find out
what's happening.

444
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,750
I am initiating
a subspace scan

445
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:37,250
to search for
temporal anomalies

446
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,125
both on and off the ship.

447
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:42,250
OGAWA:
Counselor Troi,
please report to Sick Bay.

448
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,875
I'm on my way.

449
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:46,959
Let me know if
you find anything.

450
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:55,875
Commander, how long
have I been married

451
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:58,583
to Counselor Troi?

452
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,709
Two years, one
month, and 12 days.

453
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,625
And when did this
relationship begin?

454
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,583
It is my understanding

455
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:08,250
your romantic affiliation began
shortly after you recovered

456
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:11,083
from your spinal injury
on Stardate 45587.

457
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:13,458
It was six months later that
you asked commander Riker

458
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,750
for his formal permission
to court Counselor Troi.

459
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:18,417
You felt to do otherwise

460
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,000
would be
dishonorable.

461
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,458
And then we mated?

462
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,917
I am not privy

463
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:26,208
to the exact details
of when, where or how

464
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,458
your first coupling
took place.

465
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,959
I could investigate it.

466
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,625
No, that is all right.

467
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,417
I am detecting

468
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:37,667
no temporal anomalies
in this system.

469
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:41,417
Perhaps we should attempt
to pinpoint the exact moment

470
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,875
when events
became discontinuous.

471
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,917
Do you remember
the first change?

472
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,417
I was in Sick Bay.

473
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,417
Dr. Crusher told me
I had a concussion,

474
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,542
but I do not remember
that happening.

475
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:55,583
Think back-- are you certain
that was the very first change?

476
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:58,000
Before...

477
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:04,375
Yes. Yes, I was
in Engineering.

478
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:05,792
I felt a wave of dizziness,

479
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:08,166
and when I looked up,
you and Commander La Forge

480
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:10,750
were on the opposite side
of the room

481
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:12,500
and Captain Picard was gone.

482
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:14,291
I thought I had
blacked out for a moment

483
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:17,375
and had not observed
your movements.

484
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:22,709
And at my birthday party,
the cake was chocolate

485
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,375
and then it was yellow.

486
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,041
And Commander Riker told me

487
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,000
Captain Picard
was not going to attend,

488
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,959
and then suddenly
he was there.

489
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,166
Hmm... we should try to find

490
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:35,000
the commonalities
in these events.

491
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,125
Who were the people
you were with?

492
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:40,667
Everyone was
at my birthday party.

493
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:43,417
Then I was with Counselor Troi

494
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:46,375
then Commander La Forge
came in...

495
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,208
Geordi...

496
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:51,625
Geordi was present
at all three locations

497
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:53,333
and he was near me
in each case

498
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:56,083
just before
I noticed the differences.

499
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:57,959
There has to be a connection.

500
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,542
It is possible.

501
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,417
We should speak

502
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,250
to Commander
La Forge.

503
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,917
Doctor, is Geordi well enough

504
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,125
to answer a few questions?

505
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,333
Geordi's dead.

506
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,709
There do not appear to be
any unusual readings.

507
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,834
Energy residuals
from the plasma burns,

508
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:32,375
the beginnings of
cellular decomposition...

509
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,500
I see nothing that connects
these bio-readings

510
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:38,834
to your recent sense
of discontinuity.

511
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,375
What about
his visor?

512
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,709
I still see nothing unusual.

513
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,500
Perhaps we should activate it.

514
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:53,375
Hook it up
to the diagnostic array

515
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:54,583
and I'll
check it out.

516
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,750
The visor is active.

517
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,834
Worf, are you
all right?

518
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:14,792
Have you noticed
another discontinuity?

519
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,959
Dr. Crusher
was not here.

520
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,542
Dr. Ogawa was.

521
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,000
<i>Doctor</i> Ogawa?

522
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,834
And my uniform has changed.

523
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,625
What is my rank
and position?

524
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:29,917
TROI:
You're a commander

525
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,875
and first officer.

526
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:34,834
Are... we still married?

527
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:37,250
Yes.

528
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,500
DATA:
I am detecting
a quantum flux

529
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:40,709
in your cellular RNA.

530
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,583
What does that mean?

531
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,125
I do not know.

532
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:47,208
I will have to analyze
these readings.

533
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:54,959
I have found
that the quantum flux

534
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,959
in Worf's cellular RNA

535
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,166
extends
to the subatomic level.

536
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:01,583
It is asynchronous
with normal matter.

537
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,000
In essence, Captain,

538
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,083
Mr. Worf does not belong
in our universe.

539
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,083
What?

540
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,583
All matter
in the universe

541
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:12,291
resonates on a quantum level
with a unique signature.

542
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,250
That signature is constant.

543
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,500
It cannot be changed

544
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:17,041
through any
known process.

545
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:19,667
It is the basic foundation
of existence.

546
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:22,041
Are you saying that
Worf's quantum signature

547
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,834
is different from ours?

548
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,000
Yes, sir.
I cannot explain it.

549
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:29,583
It is as if he originates from
a different quantum universe.

550
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:32,917
Mr. Worf, you say the
discontinuities started

551
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:34,291
to occur after you returned

552
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,375
from a<i> Bat'leth</i> tournament
on Forcas III.

553
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:37,834
Yes, sir.

554
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,166
Now, I know for a fact
that you never attended

555
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,083
that tournament, and
that no shuttlecraft

556
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,542
has left the<i> Enterprise</i> 
for over a month.

557
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,500
I understand that,

558
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,959
but I also clearly remember
attending the tournament

559
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,959
and returning to the ship
in a shuttlecraft.

560
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,083
Do you remember the route
you took to return?

561
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,208
Yes.

562
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,041
Let's backtrack
that course.

563
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,417
See if there are any
unusual readings
or anomalies.

564
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,500
DATA: Aye, sir.

565
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:03,166
If I may inquire, sir

566
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:06,417
how long have you been Captain
of the<i> Enterprise?</i>

567
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:09,166
Four years.

568
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,667
Ever since
Captain Picard was killed

569
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,875
in the incident with the Borg.

570
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,458
You don't remember
any of this, do you?

571
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:21,625
I do remember.

572
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,125
I just remember it differently.

573
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:33,959
Captain,

574
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,625
I'm picking up a minor
subspace disturbance

575
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,792
off the port bow.

576
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,083
Full stop.
MAN: Aye, sir.

577
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,417
Analysis, Mr. Data.

578
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,208
It appears to be
a quantum fissure

579
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,291
in the space-time continuum.

580
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,583
On screen.

581
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:48,166
DATA:
The anomaly cannot be seen,

582
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:49,625
but I believe
I can enhance it

583
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:52,041
with a warp field
to make it visible.

584
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,625
RIKER:
Is it dangerous?

585
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,041
DATA:
Not from this distance, sir.

586
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:58,750
I am also detecting
an ion trail

587
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:00,709
intersecting
the phenomenon.

588
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,458
I believe it was left

589
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,583
by a Starfleet
type-6 shuttlecraft.

590
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,458
So I<i> was</i> here.

591
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,333
I have an
explanation, sir.

592
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,959
I believe the quantum
fissure we discovered

593
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,250
is a fixed point across
the space-time continuum--

594
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:21,750
a keyhole which intersects
many other quantum realities.

595
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,917
What do you mean,
"quantum realities"?

596
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:25,959
For any event,
there is an infinite number

597
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,959
of possible outcomes.

598
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,625
Our choices determine
which outcomes will follow,

599
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:33,417
but there is a theory
in quantum physics

600
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:37,041
that all possibilities
that can happen, do happen

601
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:40,208
in alternate
quantum realities.

602
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,792
And somehow I have
been shifting

603
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,667
from one reality
to another.

604
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:45,333
That is correct.

605
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:46,750
How did
this happen?

606
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:50,917
When Worf's shuttlecraft

607
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:53,417
came into contact
with the quantum fissure,

608
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:56,542
I believe its warp engines
caused a small break

609
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,041
in the barriers
between quantum realities.

610
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,917
Worf was thrown into
a state of quantum flux.

611
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:04,542
He immediately shifted
into other realities.

612
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:07,458
And Geordi's visor
somehow triggered that effect.

613
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,792
Exactly.

614
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:11,375
The visor uses
a subspace field pulse.

615
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:13,625
I believe that whenever
Geordi came near Worf

616
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:16,417
the field pulse intensified
the quantum flux

617
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:17,750
and pushed Worf

618
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,709
into another reality.

619
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,917
Well, how can we find
my original quantum state

620
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:23,542
and return me too it?

621
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,041
WES:
We could scan
the quantum fissure

622
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:27,500
using a subspace
differential pulse.

623
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:29,959
Maybe we could find
the quantum state

624
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,583
that shares
Worf's signature

625
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,709
and find a way
to get him back.

626
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,959
An excellent idea,
Lieutenant.

627
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:56,041
Worf...

628
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,250
from what I understand,

629
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:02,458
there's a good chance
<i>my</i> Worf won't return.

630
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,667
I guess it's just hard
for me to accept

631
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:12,625
that there's a reality out
there where you never loved me.

632
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:20,917
Deanna, I have always
considered you a close friend.

633
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,542
And although I have never

634
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:27,625
seriously considered
a romantic relationship,

635
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:31,750
I would not be opposed
to the possibility.

636
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,250
What about our children?

637
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:37,417
Children?

638
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,000
You didn't know?

639
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:44,083
When the last shift
occurred in Sick Bay,

640
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,375
we did not have any children.

641
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:54,375
We have a little girl,
Shannara.

642
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,000
She's two years old.

643
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,250
And a three-year-old boy,

644
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:00,250
Eric-Christopher.

645
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:07,166
What about Alexander?

646
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:09,417
Alexander?

647
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,250
He was my son
in another reality.

648
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,166
I've used
a differential pulse

649
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,917
to analyze over 10
million quantum states

650
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:38,458
within the fissure,

651
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,792
but I still haven't found
one with your signature.

652
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:42,583
This may take
some time, sir.

653
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,083
Captain, a Bajoran ship
is approaching.

654
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,166
RIKER:
Red alert.

655
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:48,583
The Bajorans?

656
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:49,917
Ever since
the Bajorans

657
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:51,625
overpowered the
Cardassian empire,

658
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,500
they've become more
and more aggressive.

659
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:55,959
Yesterday, they destroyed
one of our subspace telescopes

660
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
because they thought
we were using it to
spy against them.

661
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,417
They're charging
their weapons, sir.

662
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,875
Shields!

663
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:03,166
(<i> blast, crash</i> )

664
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,458
Return fire.

665
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,750
They've damaged
our power systems, sir.

666
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:09,333
It's caused an energy surge
within the subspace pulse.

667
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:12,000
The quantum fissure
is beginning to destabilize.

668
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,583
Can we disengage the pulse?

669
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,583
(<i> blast, crash</i> )

670
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,083
WES:
Too late, sir.

671
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,625
What the hell is happening?

672
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:28,375
The barriers between quantum
realities are breaking down.

673
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:32,333
Other realities are
emerging into our own.

674
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:48,583
The Bajoran ship
is disengaging, sir.

675
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:51,667
The rate of quantum incursions
is increasing exponentially.

676
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:53,417
At this rate, the sector
will be completely filled

677
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:56,583
with<i> Enterprises</i> 
within three days.

678
00:35:56,625 --> 00:36:00,166
Captain, we're receiving
285,000 hails.

679
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,834
I wish I knew
what to tell them.

680
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:06,125
Mr. Data, can we stop
these incursions?

681
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:09,000
Perhaps. If we
can find the ship

682
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,291
that matches Commander Worf's
quantum signature.

683
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,166
How would that help?

684
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:16,500
It was Worf's shuttlecraft
which traversed the fissure

685
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:19,125
and weakened the barriers
between quantum realities.

686
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,959
If he reenters the fissure
in his original shuttle

687
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,291
and emits
a broad-spectrum warp field,

688
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:25,917
it may be enough
to seal the fissure

689
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:27,250
and stop additional realities

690
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,709
from entering our own.

691
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,875
What then?

692
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,500
How do we get
the<i> Enterprises</i>

693
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,458
that are already here
back to where they belong?

694
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,041
In theory,
the act of sealing the fissure

695
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,041
should restore the barriers

696
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,458
between quantum states.

697
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,542
The ships would return
to their own realities.

698
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:45,041
Lieutenant Crusher,

699
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:48,500
send a general hail--
all ships.

700
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:51,583
CRUSHER: Aye, sir.

701
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:54,458
This is Captain Riker
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

702
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,875
That is, the<i> Enterprise,</i>

703
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:59,125
that is indigenous
to this universe.

704
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:02,208
We've all encountered
a quantum anomaly.

705
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,208
We think we have
found a way

706
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,583
to return us all
to our proper realities,

707
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,375
but we need to find
that ship

708
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:11,625
which exhibits
a certain quantum signature.

709
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:15,375
Our Mr. Data will transmit
that signature to you now.

710
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:22,458
(<i> multiple communication beeps</i> )

711
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,000
Anything?

712
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,875
There's too much
com traffic, sir.

713
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:28,709
It's tough to isolate
who's talking to who.

714
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,041
Wait a minute.

715
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,333
Here it is.

716
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,083
Someone's
responding.

717
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,667
On screen.

718
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:37,875
Captain, it would appear
that we have found

719
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:39,583
the quantum signature
you were looking for.

720
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,166
RIKER: Data believes

721
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:43,875
that by sending Worf back
through the fissure again,

722
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:46,959
it would return us all
to our proper realities.

723
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,083
Our Data has said
the same thing.

724
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:52,333
We need you to send us
your shuttlecraft<i> Curie.</i>

725
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:53,875
We're launching it now.

726
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:55,166
Thank you.

727
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:58,041
It's good to see you
again, Captain.

728
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,959
It's been a long time.

729
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,500
RIKER:
Did they send
the right shuttle?

730
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:11,166
Yes, sir.
It matches Commander Worf's

731
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:13,166
quantum signature precisely.

732
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,000
I have remodulated
the shuttle's engines

733
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,792
to emit an inverse warp field.

734
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:19,417
You will need to activate
that field

735
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:21,083
at the precise moment
you enter the fissure.

736
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,417
Assuming it works,

737
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:24,500
will I find myself
near my own ship?

738
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:26,959
That is one possibility.

739
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,625
However, the uncertainty
principle

740
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,542
dictates that time is
a variable in this equation.

741
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,041
You may end up

742
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:35,500
several days before the event
or several days after.

743
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:37,542
There is no way to tell.

744
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,041
I understand.

745
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,667
Good luck.

746
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,333
Setting course for the fissure.

747
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:31,333
RIKER:
Acknowledged.

748
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:32,750
(<i> crash</i> )

749
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:35,542
Captain, the shuttlecraft
is under attack.

750
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,083
The Bajorans again.

751
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,750
No, sir. It's one
of the<i> Enterprises.</i>

752
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,500
They're hailing us.

753
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,542
On screen.

754
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,000
We won't go back.

755
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:49,000
You don't know what it's like
in our universe.

756
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,792
The Federation's gone!

757
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:53,709
The Borg is everywhere!

758
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,250
We're one of
the last ships left.

759
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:57,417
Please, you've got to help us!

760
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,583
I'm sorry, there's no choice.

761
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,875
If this works,
everything
will return...

762
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:03,667
No! We won't go back!

763
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:06,458
Sir, they're firing
on the shuttlecraft.

764
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,583
Open fire.
Try to disable them.

765
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:13,041
Direct hit.

766
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,667
Their shields
have collapsed.

767
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:16,333
Their engine core's
overloading.

768
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,291
What happened?

769
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,291
It looks like the ship had
already taken heavy damage.

770
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:26,959
Their warp containment field
must have been weak.

771
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,417
Probably from fighting
with the Borg.

772
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:31,250
Captain, Worf is
entering the fissure.

773
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:37,667
Charging primary systems.

774
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:41,208
Initiating inverse warp field.

775
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,667
Worf to<i> Enterprise.</i>

776
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,583
PICARD:
<i>Enterprise</i> here.

777
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:22,542
Captain,
is everything all right?

778
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:26,208
Yes, Lieutenant.
Is there a problem?

779
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,125
No, I do not believe so,

780
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,333
but I will explain
when I arrive.

781
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:34,041
How was the<i> Bat'leth</i> tournament?

782
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:37,667
It was fine, sir.

783
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,083
I won champion standing.

784
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,250
So, you think
this quantum fissure

785
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,750
is nothing that we
need to worry about?

786
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:54,000
No, no, I believe

787
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,291
the inverse warp
field resealed it.

788
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,417
I'm looking forward
to reading your report.

789
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:08,792
Something wrong?

790
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:11,208
I know what you
are planning, sir.

791
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,000
I will not be surprised.

792
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:15,458
Surprised? I don't know
what you're talking about.

793
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,291
Of course you don't.

794
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,125
Welcome home, Worf.
Uhh!

795
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:40,917
I hope you don't mind
I let myself in.

796
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,333
I promised Alexander

797
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:43,834
I'd feed his
Dalvan hissing beetle

798
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,208
while you were both away.

799
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,083
So, you do not live here?

800
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:52,583
What's that supposed
to mean?

801
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:56,250
It is a long story.

802
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:03,709
Happy birthday, Worf.

803
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,458
Will wanted to give you
a surprise party, but I knew

804
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,750
you'd hate it, so I
talked him out of it.

805
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:11,458
Thank you.

806
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
I know Klingons
like to be alone

807
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:14,834
on their birthdays.

808
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,125
You probably want
to meditate

809
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:19,875
or hit yourself with
a painstik or something.

810
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:21,625
Deanna...

811
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,625
You do not
have to leave.

812
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:27,083
Oh?

813
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:30,166
I... have not
had dinner.

814
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:33,125
Would you care
to... join me?

815
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:35,959
I'd love to.

816
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,792
Champagne.
