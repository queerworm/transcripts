1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:05,542
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46235.7.</i>

2
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:08,542
<i>Ensign Ro, Keiko O'Brien,</i>
<i>Guinan, and I are</i>

3
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:11,333
<i>returning to the</i> Enterprise<i> </i>
<i>after a fascinating visit</i>

4
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:13,208
<i>to the planet</i>
<i>Marlonia.</i>

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,542
And these pieces
I found

6
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:16,709
on the tertiary
level of the dig.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,542
They're typical
of second-century

8
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:19,917
Marlonian cookware.

9
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:21,375
Look at
those markings.

10
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,000
They're very similar

11
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,667
to early
Taguan designs,

12
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:26,834
but the patterns are
more intricate.

13
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,792
They're much closer
to Buranian than Taguan.

14
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:32,500
You're on the most beautiful
planet in the quadrant,

15
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:35,542
and you spent your
entire shore leave in a cave?

16
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,875
It was a very
rewarding experience.

17
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:40,709
Look at these
fragments.

18
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,417
They're very nearly
in perfect condition,

19
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,542
and yet they're
700 years old.

20
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,542
So's my father.

21
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:50,959
Is that
a<i> draebidium froctus?</i>

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,709
Um... actually,
it's a<i> draebidium calimus.</i>

23
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,291
You can tell by
the shape of the leaves.

24
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,750
I didn't know you were
interested in plant biology.

25
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,291
I... took a class
at the academy.

26
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,166
I don't remember
very much, though.

27
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,041
WORF:
<i>Enterprise to</i>
<i>Shuttlecraft Fermi.</i>

28
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,417
This is the<i> Fermi.</i>
Go ahead,<i> Enterprise.</i>

29
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,291
We have just received
a distress signal

30
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,458
from the Starfleet
science team on Ligos VII.

31
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,834
Can you identify
the problem?

32
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,792
No, sir-- the call was
cut off in mid-transmission.

33
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,208
Lay in a course, and prepare
to engage at warp eight

34
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,834
as soon as we're on board.
Aye, sir.

35
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,458
We'll rendezvous with the
ship in three minutes, sir.

36
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,834
RO:
we're caught in some sort
of energy field.

37
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,583
Hard about.
Full impulse.
Aye, sir.

38
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:41,917
What's happening,
Mr. Worf?

39
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,875
The shuttle has been
enveloped by an energy field.

40
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:46,333
Its engines and life support
have failed.

41
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,792
Increase
to full impulse.

42
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:49,333
Bridge to
Transporter Room Three.

43
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,291
Prepare to beam
the shuttle crew back

44
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,667
once we're in range.

45
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:53,917
O'BRIEN:
Ready, sir.

46
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,542
I can't contact
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

47
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,291
There's too much
interference.

48
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,500
Transfer auxiliary power
to inertial dampers.

49
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:02,959
COMPUTER:
Warning, structural
failure imminent.

50
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,458
Have you got them,
O'Brien?

51
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,041
I'm trying, sir.

52
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,875
I can't get
a pattern lock.

53
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:13,667
The shuttle is
coming apart, Chief.

54
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,166
We've got to do it now.

55
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:18,333
I've got them.

56
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,208
There's a 40%
drop in mass.

57
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,375
I may have lost
one of them.

58
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,208
Thank you,
Mr. O'Brien.

59
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,208
Another moment
and...

60
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,000
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

61
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,041
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

62
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,875
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

63
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:24,875
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

64
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:29,291
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

65
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:34,083
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

66
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,709
According
to the bio-scans,

67
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,834
their DNA structure
is now consistent

68
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,625
with those of
preadolescents.

69
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:57,125
But as far as we can tell,
only their bodies were changed.

70
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,792
Their individual
intelligence

71
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,959
and their behavioral responses
are exactly the same

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,250
as they were
before the accident.

73
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,583
What happened
to the shuttlecraft, Number One?

74
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,625
The shuttle broke up
just after we beamed you out.

75
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,458
Mr. Data is coordinating
the salvage efforts

76
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,041
right now... sir.

77
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:19,125
What about the energy field
that the shuttle passed through?

78
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,917
We're trying to scan it,
but we're running into

79
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,250
a lot of interference--
it's going to take some time.

80
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,417
PICARD:
Well, we can't afford
to stay here any longer.

81
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,041
We'll leave
a class-4 probe behind

82
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,125
to study the energy field,
but the distress signal

83
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,917
from Ligos VII has
top priority.

84
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,250
Let me know
as soon as you have

85
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,792
any further
information, Doctor.

86
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,750
Number One,
you're with me.

87
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:41,500
Captain, I... need to run
some additional tests.

88
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,000
Of course,
the three of you

89
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,625
will remain as needed
to assist Dr. Crusher.

90
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

91
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,917
What?

92
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,333
You know, you make
a pretty cute kid.

93
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,500
Great, just what
I want to be-- cute.

94
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:09,458
Were you this much fun
when you were a kid?

95
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,709
I was in
a refugee camp.

96
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,709
"Fun" wasn't exactly
in my vocabulary.

97
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,083
What about now?

98
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,542
You're not in
that camp anymore.

99
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,041
Fun is being
back at work

100
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,291
in my own uniform.

101
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,875
Bridge.

102
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,291
Mr. Worf, prepare
to launch a class-4 probe

103
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,917
to study
the energy field.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,583
I realize how unusual
this must seem.

105
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,417
My appearance is
the result of an accident

106
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,834
involving myself
and three other crew members,

107
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,709
the effects of which
Dr. Crusher is

108
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,750
currently working
to remedy.

109
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,750
I assure you,
I am captain Picard.

110
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,166
The probe, aye, sir.

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,458
Mr. Data, have you secured
all of the shuttle debris?

112
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,792
Almost. It is being stored
in Shuttle Bay Two...

113
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:27,667
sir.

114
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,125
Very well.

115
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,500
Ensign, as soon as
Mr. Data is finished,

116
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:34,083
take us to Ligos
at warp eight.

117
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,750
Captain, may I see you
privately for a few moments?

118
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,959
Of course.

119
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,834
Tea, earl grey, hot.

120
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,375
Have you been able to determine
the cause of our transformation?

121
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:03,625
Not yet. I'm still waiting
for some test results.

122
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,000
I see.

123
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,625
There are 103 members
of the science team

124
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,625
on Ligos VII.

125
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,083
We should prepare
Shuttle Bay Three

126
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,709
for a triage center
in case they have

127
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,208
large numbers of casualties.

128
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,291
We'll be ready.

129
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,041
I see that
Ligos VII is prone

130
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,709
to periodic volcanic
activity.

131
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,166
Perhaps the planet has
entered an active phase.

132
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,875
Jean-Luc?

133
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:29,333
We need to talk.

134
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,166
All right,
let's talk.

135
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,959
Are you here
to relieve me of duty?

136
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:38,208
I'd rather not have
to take that step.

137
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,166
I am still
Jean-Luc Picard.

138
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,542
My judgment,
my experiences,

139
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,583
my mental capacities
are all intact.

140
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:48,458
That's true...
for now.

141
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,250
But this could be
the first stage

142
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,041
of a condition
that may begin to affect

143
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,542
your mind,
as well.

144
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,291
But you see
no evidence of that.

145
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,709
Not yet.

146
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,125
What I do know is that
the captain of this ship

147
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,291
has undergone an extreme
physical transformation,

148
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,375
the ultimate
effects of which

149
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,625
I can't even
begin to guess.

150
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,667
You<i> are</i> asking me
to step down.

151
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,792
You are still
Jean-Luc Picard.

152
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,458
What do<i> you</i> think
you should do?

153
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,250
Commander Riker, please
take command of the ship

154
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,959
until further notice.

155
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,291
Understood.

156
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,750
So, what the hell
am I supposed to do now?

157
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:05,291
You're not supposed
to do anything.

158
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,166
That's what
"relieved of duty" means.

159
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,917
Well, I should be
doing<i> something</i>

160
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,166
instead of just
standing around,

161
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,083
waiting for them
to find a cure.

162
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,333
You're right.
Let's go play.

163
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,709
What?

164
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,917
I haven't been young
for a long time,

165
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,959
and I intend to enjoy
every minute of it.

166
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,875
Fine,
enjoy yourself.

167
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,750
What are you
going to do?

168
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,250
Go back to your
room and pout?

169
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,000
I am not
12 years old.

170
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,959
If I wanna go
to my quarters

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,875
and contemplate
my situation,

172
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:41,041
that does not mean
that I am "pouting."

173
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,917
Okay, okay.

174
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:33,250
I could use a...
cup of coffee.

175
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,375
How about you?

176
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:35,750
I'll get it.

177
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,125
Two coffees,
one with cream and sugar.

178
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,583
The other one...
Black, double sweet.

179
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,792
I know.

180
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:45,417
One double sweet.

181
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,667
Careful, that's hot.

182
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:56,000
Miles...

183
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,083
Sorry.

184
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,792
What's wrong?

185
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,917
It's...
I don't know,

186
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,542
but this feels wrong
somehow.

187
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:26,125
Miles Edward O'Brien,
I am still your wife!

188
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,792
Well, technically, yes.

189
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:28,959
Technically?

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,875
No, I mean,
of course you're my wife,

191
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,375
but you're also
ten years old.

192
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:37,208
Beverly said it's
actually closer to 12.

193
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,291
Now, that's not the point.

194
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,625
So, what<i> is</i> the point?

195
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,375
Is our marriage over?

196
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,041
I didn't say that,

197
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,792
but... well,

198
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,625
until they find a way
to reverse this...

199
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,667
this effect...

200
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,917
it's hard for me
to ignore the fact

201
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,417
that you're
a little girl.

202
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,959
What if they can't
find a way?

203
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,709
What if I'm like this
for the rest of my life?

204
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,959
What does that
mean for us?

205
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,333
For our family?

206
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,166
MOLLY:
Mommy?

207
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,959
Mommy?

208
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,125
What's wrong,
sweetheart?

209
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,500
I want Mommy
to read me a story.

210
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,542
All right.

211
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,834
What story would you
like to hear?

212
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:29,834
Not you.
I want Mommy!

213
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,542
What if Daddy reads you
a story tonight?

214
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,709
Will that be okay?

215
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,333
I'll be right back.

216
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,792
Keiko.

217
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,834
It's going to be
all right.

218
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,250
I promise.

219
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,083
We'll work this out.

220
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,667
How?

221
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:03,667
I don't know.

222
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,583
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

223
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,291
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has reached</i>
<i>the Ligos system.</i>

224
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,667

<i>on a cure for the members</i>

228
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,333
(<i> door chimes</i> )

229
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,834
Come.

230
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,458
I came to see
how you're doing.

231
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,875
Well, I'll have
to speak to my tailor,

232
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:55,166
but otherwise
I'm well, thank you.

233
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,542
(<i> sighs</i> )

234
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,959
it's just so ridiculous.

235
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,417
I can't take myself
seriously like this.

236
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,125
Counselor...

237
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,667
if Dr. Crusher
can't find a cure--

238
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,250
if I have to stay
this way--

239
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,417
nobody's going to take me
seriously, are they?

240
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,709
I would say

241
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,875
the people
that know you

242
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,709
and have worked
with you

243
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,083
will be able to make
the adjustment eventually.

244
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,000
But there are some people
who would find it difficult

245
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,208
to accept
a 12-year-old captain.

246
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,166
In that case, I suppose
I'll just have to wait

247
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,125
until I grow up again
before I get another command,

248
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:34,667
which might be in
ten, maybe 15 years.

249
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:36,542
The question is,
what to do until then.

250
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,583
You're still
a Starfleet captain.

251
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,458
I'm sure there are
other assignments

252
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,875
you could be given
in the interim.

253
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,500
I've spent 30 years
of my life aboard starships.

254
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:46,500
I'm not about to sit
behind a desk now.

255
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:48,333
You could return
to the academy,

256
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,709
take another degree--
brush up on your Latin.

257
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,750
And be Wesley Crusher's
roommate.

258
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,375
I will admit that
returning to the Academy

259
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,875
does have
a certain appeal,

260
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:04,083
but I've spent my life
looking forward.

261
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,000
Going to the Academy again
feels like looking backward.

262
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,166
Then perhaps
you could spend the time

263
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,291
exploring
other interests.

264
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,125
Archaeology,
for instance.

265
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,875
Leave Starfleet?

266
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:21,083
Not permanently.
Just a sabbatical.

267
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,125
You could spend a few years
crawling through caves

268
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,458
and digging up artifacts

269
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,375
and still have
enough time to become

270
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,875
the youngest admiral
in Starfleet history.

271
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:33,750
It<i> would</i> give me a chance
to take up Dr. Langford's offer

272
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,834
and accompany her
to the ruins on Suvin IV.

273
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,875
But to leave
the<i> Enterprise...</i>

274
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,959
In a way,
you're very lucky.

275
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,834
You might have
a chance to do

276
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,834
what most people can
only dream about.

277
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:54,500
Have a second
childhood

278
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,792
without the pain
of growing up again.

279
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,959
This is captain Picard's
rybo-viroxic-nucleic structure

280
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,750
from a tissue sample
I took this morning.

281
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:11,750
It's the same as a sample
I took before the accident,

282
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:15,709
except it's missing several
of the key viroxic sequences.

283
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,458
It's been a long time since
I took genetics, Doctor.

284
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,375
RVN is one of
the key factors

285
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,542
in our development
during puberty.

286
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,750
Unlike DNA,
which never changes,

287
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,375
RVN takes on some
additional viroxic sequences

288
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:30,000
during adolescence.

289
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,583
Those sequences determine

290
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,166
how we develop
physically.

291
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,125
Without them, we wouldn't
mature into adults.

292
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,458
Exactly.

293
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,375
Now somehow,
those sequences

294
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:39,583
were eliminated
in the captain

295
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,709
and the others
during transport.

296
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,000
So, what do we do?

297
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,500
Well, we have
a couple of options.

298
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,000
These are the plants

299
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,333
Keiko was carrying
in the shuttle.

300
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,834
Whatever turned the crew
into children

301
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,333
turned these plants
into seedlings.

302
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,125
I accelerated
the growth on one of them,

303
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,083
and it developed into
a perfectly normal adult plant.

304
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,709
I don't suppose that
would work with people?

305
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,500
No, but at least we know
that if we do nothing at all,

306
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:11,375
they will probably grow up
just as they did before.

307
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,250
That's one option.

308
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:17,291
However, I do have
the adult RVN patterns

309
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,667
of all four of them.

310
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,333
I might be able
to send them back

311
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,333
through the transporter
pattern buffer

312
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,667
and replace
the missing sequences.

313
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:26,542
No, but we can't even
attempt to do that

314
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,458
until we know why this
happened in the first place.

315
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,041
If somehow they were to lose
more viroxic sequences...

316
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,125
They would get
even younger.

317
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:58,458
Chief, I got the sensor report
on the shuttle breakup.

318
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,875
Looks like the breakup began
near the starboard bulkhead.

319
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:04,375
There's some bulkhead
fragments over here.

320
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,250
Hmm.

321
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,125
Well, my visor's
picking up some...

322
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,291
torsional
stress damage,

323
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,709
some micro-fractures...

324
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,417
Hang on a second.

325
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,750
What's this?

326
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:24,000
Looks like tritanium
from the hull.

327
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,500
Yeah, but look.

328
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,000
That's not
tritanium anymore.

329
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,917
Somehow the molecular structure
of this alloy has been changed.

330
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:36,041
Broken down into its
constituent elements.

331
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,166
Ah, no wonder
the bulkhead shattered, huh?

332
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,208
Yeah, I want to get
a sample of this

333
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,083
down to engineering and run
a metallurgical analysis.

334
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

335
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,709
Well, this is exciting.

336
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,208
Would you rather be
playing with dolls?

337
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,333
I'd rather be doing
almost anything

338
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:09,250
other than sitting here
and watching you sulk.

339
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,000
This isn't
some kind of glorious

340
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,500
second childhood,
Guinan.

341
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:17,834
Our bodies have been
violated-- changed.

342
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,667
Doesn't that bother you?

343
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:22,583
Sure, it bothers me,
but at the moment

344
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,917
I can't do
anything about it,

345
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,875
so I might as well
enjoy it.

346
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:28,417
Enjoy what?

347
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,125
Where did you get the idea
that being short and awkward

348
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,250
is some kind of
wonderful gift?

349
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,834
There must have been
some part of childhood

350
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,291
that you didn't loathe.

351
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,667
Look, it was a long,

352
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,542
depressing period
of my life,

353
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,125
and I was grateful when
it was finally over.

354
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,583
I'd rather not
relive it.

355
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,000
I bet you were a jumper.

356
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,458
A jumper, you know.

357
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,542
Someone who jumps up and down
on furniture all the time.

358
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,834
What?

359
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,792
You were a jumper,
all right.

360
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:00,458
The quiet ones--

361
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,291
they always look
so innocent.

362
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,000
You think you can turn
your back on them.

363
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:09,166
Next thing you know, bam!

364
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,125
They're bouncing
on the bed.

365
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,458
That is the most
ridiculous thing

366
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,000
I've ever heard.

367
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,458
Most of the time,
I didn't even have a bed.

368
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,625
But you did have
one sometimes,

369
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,625
and I bet
you jumped on it.

370
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:25,041
I most certainly did not.

371
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,250
Yeah, I can see it
in your eyes.

372
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,667
You can barely
resist the urge

373
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:31,667
to leap up
and start jumping around

374
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,458
like a Tarkassian
razorbeast.

375
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,667
Guinan.

376
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,166
Oh, yeah--
oh, yeah.

377
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,500
This is ridiculous!

378
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:43,583
That's right,
and don't you dare

379
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,166
join me,
Ro Laren.

380
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,083
You don't like
jumping on beds.

381
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,583
Oh, yeah?

382
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,375
I can jump higher!

383
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:53,750
(<i> laughing</i> )

384
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,417
We think the shuttle was caught
in a molecular reversion field,

385
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,917
which caused the structure
of the ship to deteriorate.

386
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,375
When the field
penetrated the hull,

387
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,375
it also began to affect
the shuttle's crew.

388
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,792
When I tried
to beam them off,

389
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:05,250
I wasn't able
to get a lock

390
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,542
because the
reversion field

391
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,792
was masking part
of the patterns.

392
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:10,709
If the transporter
only registered

393
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,959
part of the RVN patterns,
that would explain why

394
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,375
the key sequences
are missing.

395
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,750
Exactly. With those
key sequences missing,

396
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:19,083
the transporter
reconstructed them
as children.

397
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,625
If they're right,
would you be able

398
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,500
to use the transporter
to reverse the effects?

399
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:23,875
I think so.

400
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:25,375
As long as there's
no reversion field

401
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:28,125
to mask their patterns,
we should be able to do it.

402
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,834
Chief,
can you adjust

403
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,875
the molecular imaging
scanners to accept...?

404
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,041
WORF:
Bridge to Commander Riker.

405
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,792
Go ahead.
We are entering orbit

406
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:36,208
around Ligos VII, sir.

407
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,834
On my way.
We'll discuss this later.

408
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

409
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,291
Standard orbit,
Ensign.

410
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,250
Any sign
of the science team?

411
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,458
We've been scanning the area
since we entered the system,

412
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,959
but our readings
are being disrupted.

413
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,417
Cause?

414
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:05,458
Extreme fluctuations
in the electromagnetic field.

415
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,125
However, there is no evidence
of stellar or seismic activity

416
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,834
which would cause
the interference.

417
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,834
Any response
to our hails, Mr. Worf?

418
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,000
No, sir. I've been
attempting to...

419
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:17,250
(<i> console beeping</i> )

420
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,667
Commander, two ships
de-cloaking, fore and aft.

421
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:23,750
Klingon Birds-of-Prey--
B'rel-class.

422
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,250
RIKER:
Maximum shields!

423
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,417
Take us out of
orbit, Ensign.

424
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,709
Mr. Worf, prepare
to return fire.

425
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,834
(<i> alarm wailing</i> )

426
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,291
Damage report.

427
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,792
We have lost
primary life support.

428
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,375
Switching to
secondary systems.

429
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:00,667
Lock phasers on target.
Bearing to port.

430
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:02,041
Phasers locked.

431
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,166
Fire.

432
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,291
Minor damage
to one ship.

433
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,667
Its shields are
holding.

434
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:11,250
Starboard power coupling
is down.

435
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,917
Warp engines are offline.

436
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,709
Shields?

437
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,333
Down to 13%.

438
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:24,041
Casualties reported
on Deck 26 and 27.

439
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:27,000
Sensors and secondary
generators are offline.

440
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,333
Life support
down to 67%.

441
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,500
Engineering,
status report.

442
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,542
Those last shots took out
auxiliary power

443
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:36,792
and emergency backup.

444
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,250
It's going to take
at least an hour

445
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,625
to get warp power
back online.

446
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,333
We have lost shields,
heavy casualties

447
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,834
on Decks 35 through 40.

448
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,959
I am detecting
transporter signatures

449
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,333
in three cargo bays.

450
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,250
We are being boarded, sir.

451
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,041
Come with me.

452
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,417
Initiate
intruder alert.

453
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:04,250
All security teams
report to...

454
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:10,083
Put down your weapons.

455
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:20,000
Computer, deactivate
all command functions.

456
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,000
Authorization:
Riker omega three.

457
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,917
All command
functions suspended.

458
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:31,083
This is Morta, we have
secured the bridge.

459
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,792
Begin transporting
all able-bodied adults

460
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:36,000
to the surface.

461
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,834
Come on!
Get up there.

462
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,583
Come on!

463
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,709
They have locked out
the command functions.

464
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,250
You said they would
not have time.

465
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:04,041
You led the assault team.

466
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,458
You were too slow.

467
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,709
You dare to blame me?

468
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:16,166
We have secured
the ship, Daimon,

469
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,208
but Morta's incompetence has
denied us access to the...

470
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,750
My incompetence?!
Daimon, you know...

471
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:22,959
Enough.

472
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,917
Where is the captain
of this ship?

473
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,959
I'm in command
of this vessel.

474
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,333
Who are you, and on
whose authority do...?

475
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,500
I am Daimon Lurin,

476
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:35,166
and I declare
this ship to be a loss

477
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,709
and open to claim

478
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,583
according to the Ferengi
salvage code.

479
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:43,125
You will cooperate with
our salvage operations,

480
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,375
or we will begin...

481
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,834
executing your crew.

482
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:11,875
Is everyone
all right?

483
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:14,375
No fatalities or injuries
among the children.

484
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:15,792
The Ferengi have
taken control

485
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,500
of Main Engineering
and Decks 23 through 37.

486
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:20,834
Well, we have to also assume
that they've taken the bridge.

487
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,667
Captain, do you know
what they've done

488
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:25,417
with the younger children--
with my little girl?

489
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,834
Well, they're taking
all the adults

490
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,709
down to the surface.

491
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,083
Looks like they're keeping
all the children

492
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,750
on board the ship--
where was your daughter?

493
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:34,125
In primary care
on Deck 14.

494
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,792
She's probably still there
with the others.

495
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:37,417
I wouldn't worry.

496
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,625
We need to regain
control of the ship.

497
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,041
Options?

498
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,792
We could flood the ship
with anesthezine gas.

499
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,250
No, that's been
locked out with

500
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,875
the rest of the
command functions.

501
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:51,166
If they're
typical Ferengi,

502
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:52,208
they're probably
very pleased

503
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,667
with themselves
by now.

504
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:55,792
Maybe even getting
a little overconfident.

505
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:58,041
Agreed, they might
think they don't need

506
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,083
as much of their crew
to hold the ship.

507
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,667
We could use
the element of surprise

508
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,458
to give us
a tactical advantage.

509
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,959
Tactical advantage?

510
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,375
Jean-Luc,

511
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:08,917
look at your team
for a minute.

512
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,709
We're children.

513
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,250
We can't just stay here while
our ship is being commandeered.

514
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,125
I'm not suggesting
that we do,

515
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,583
but we can't act
as if we were still adults.

516
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,583
Well, what do you
suggest we do?

517
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,333
We look like
children.

518
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:25,500
Maybe it's time we started
acting like children.

519
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,709
Ahh...

520
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:38,583
i hope your profit margin's

521
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,250
pretty high for
this little adventure,

522
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:43,375
because you're risking war
with the Federation.

523
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:46,625
We're not affiliated
with the Ferengi alliance.

524
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:50,417
We are in business
for ourselves.

525
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:55,500
Yes, it will be
highly profitable.

526
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:58,500
For an investment of
two surplus Klingon ships,

527
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:01,792
a few repairs,
and some weapons,

528
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:05,625
we've netted a Federation
starship and her crew,

529
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:10,125
not to mention a planet
rich in vendarite.

530
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,667
So, that's what
this is all about.

531
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,250
What did you do with
the science team

532
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,834
that was on the surface?

533
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:19,041
They've proved
most, uh... helpful

534
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,125
in extracting the mineral.

535
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,542
You used them
as slave laborers.

536
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:26,333
The addition
of your crew

537
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:29,250
will greatly
speed up the process.

538
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:34,166
As for your ship...

539
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,542
I'm sure
that it will fetch

540
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:41,625
a handsome price
on the Romulan market.

541
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,792
But before
that can happen,

542
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:47,250
we need to regain access
to your central computer.

543
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:50,291
You don't really think
I'm going to help you.

544
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:53,250
I think that
the mines on Ligos VII

545
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,166
can be very hazardous.

546
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,750
Now... how many
people on your ship?

547
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,750
1,014.

548
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:08,208
Very hazardous,
Commander.

549
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:15,208
Hello, I'm the classroom
computer system.

550
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,667
What can I do for you
today?

551
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:19,500
Computer, display
interior security grid.

552
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:21,959
I'm sorry,
but I can't do that.

553
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,208
Would you like
to play a game?

554
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,667
No, I would not.

555
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:29,792
Computer, display an
internal schematic diagram.

556
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:32,625
I'm sorry,
but I can't do that.

557
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,625
Would you like to see
some interesting plants

558
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,291
or animals?

559
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,959
It's a child's
computer, remember?

560
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,333
Computer,
can you show me a picture

561
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,208
of the inside
of the<i> Enterprise?</i>

562
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,583
Yes, I can.

563
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:49,667
The<i> Enterprise</i> is
a galaxy-class starship.

564
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:52,125
Do you know how to spell<i> </i>
<i>"Enterprise"?</i>

565
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:54,792
"E-N-T-E-R...

566
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:56,625
Delete audio.

567
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:59,458
All right,
this'll have to do.

568
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
We're here.

569
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:02,834
There's
a service conduit

570
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,750
that runs to here
and then leads

571
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,959
to a Jefferies
tube here.

572
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,667
But you and Ensign Ro
will still have to cross

573
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:11,375
this corridor before you can
get to Main Engineering.

574
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,458
Captain!

575
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,417
PICARD:
Excellent.

576
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,166
Ready?

577
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,792
Make it so.

578
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:37,583
What the devil...?

579
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,000
I was just playing.

580
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,917
I'm sorry,
Captain.

581
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,000
Alexander,
would you mind

582
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,792
if I borrowed your toy
for a little while?

583
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,000
Go ahead.
Thank you.

584
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,750
After you.

585
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,417
(<i> door opens</i> )

586
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:33,458
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

587
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:10,875
I've got the phasers,
Captain.

588
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,959
This is the first time
these Jefferies tubes

589
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,750
haven't seemed cramped.

590
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,583
How much farther
do we have to go?

591
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:41,959
Oh, about 50 meters.

592
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,834
Don't tell me
you're tired.

593
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,417
I'm not as young
as I used to be.

594
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,375
(<i> both laughing</i> )

595
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:43,959
This is it--
Main Engineering.

596
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,792
Now we wait.

597
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:50,917
Report?

598
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,500
Mission accomplished, sir.

599
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:54,333
The one in Sick Bay
never saw me.

600
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,875
Very good.

601
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,667
I'd say we're ready.

602
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:04,125
Have you figured out
how to get to the bridge?

603
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,750
I'm afraid I can only
think of one way.

604
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:16,041
What do you want?

605
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,834
I need to see
my father.

606
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:18,959
Go back inside.

607
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,875
I need to see him
right now.

608
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:22,709
Do not argue
with me.

609
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,834
Go back inside.

610
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,208
I need to see him now!

611
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,458
Now! Now! Now! Now!
Now! Now! Now! Now!

612
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,709
Stop it!
You hurt me!

613
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,083
I want my father!
I want my father!

614
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:34,417
All right.
Just stop that.

615
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,083
PICARD:
Let me go!

616
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,500
Here he is.

617
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,417
Now be quiet.

618
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:43,709
What is going on?

619
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,375
Dad!

620
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:56,417
So, son,
how are you?

621
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:57,834
I'm okay.

622
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:00,750
And how are your friends--
Keiko and Guinan and Ro?

623
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,166
They're okay, too.

624
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,917
But...

625
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,542
What's wrong?

626
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,959
Well, we don't have
anything to do.

627
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,166
None of the games
are working.

628
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:17,291
I know, the Ferengi made Daddy
turn off the main computer.

629
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,917
Well, can't you just
turn on the kid's computer

630
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,792
in Schoolroom Eight?

631
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:23,500
We just want to play
a few games.

632
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:26,458
I don't know if
they'll let me, Jean-Luc,

633
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,583
but I will ask.

634
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,834
Thanks, Number One.

635
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:36,208
He's my number-one dad.

636
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:45,625
CHILD 1:
Here they come.

637
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,625
CHILD 2:
shh!

638
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,875
(<i> door closes</i> )
How did it go?

639
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:55,458
Did Commander Riker
get the message?

640
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,083
He understood.

641
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:02,083
We should have
access very soon.

642
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:14,417
(<i> door chimes</i> )

643
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,000
Come in.

644
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:22,834
I understand your son
was here to see you.

645
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:25,208
That's right.

646
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,792
We Ferengi do not
bring our offspring

647
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:29,458
along with us
aboard ship.

648
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,542
Then I suppose
that's your loss.

649
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,250
We consider our families
one of our strengths.

650
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:38,375
I think you will find that
they can also be a weakness.

651
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:42,125
Unless you release
the computer to our control,

652
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:45,667
I will execute
every child on this ship,

653
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:48,041
beginning with yours.

654
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:52,458
Even you wouldn't be
that cruel.

655
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,625
It is cruel to put
children in danger

656
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:57,834
by bringing them aboard
a starship in the first place.

657
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,458
Ahh!

658
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:03,625
All right...

659
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:06,333
just so you don't
harm my son.

660
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,333
You will release
the computer

661
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:14,208
and show Morta
exactly how to use it.

662
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,250
Ahh...

663
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:34,166
Computer, release
command control,

664
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:35,291
this station.

665
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:37,166
Authorization:
Riker omega three.

restored.

667
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,583
Okay, Morta...

668
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:44,917
the<i> Enterprise</i> computer
system is controlled

669
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:48,125
by three primary main
processor cores,

670
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:49,959
cross-linked
with a redundant

671
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,208
melacortz ramistat

672
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,417
14-kiloquad
interface modules.

673
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,542
The core element...

674
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,583
is based on
an FTL nanoprocessor

675
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:01,083
with 25 bilateral
kelilactirals,

676
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,917
with 20 of those
being slaved

677
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:05,625
into the primary
heisenfram terminal.

678
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,917
Now, you do know what
a bilateral kelilactiral is?

679
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:11,583
Well, of course
I do, human.

680
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:14,250
I am not stupid.

681
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,083
No. Of course not.

682
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:19,125
This is the isopalavial
interface, which controls

683
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,375
the main firomactal
drive unit.

684
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,792
Don't touch that.

685
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:24,625
You'll blow up the entire
firomactal drive.

686
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:27,166
Oh, uh, wh-what...?
Wait... uh...

687
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:30,625
what is a--
a firomactal drive?

688
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:34,166
Well, just
explain it to me.

689
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,834
That is the firomactal
drive unit.

690
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,875
It controls
the ramistat core

691
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:44,333
and keeps the
Ontarian manifold

692
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,333
at 40,000 KRGs.

693
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,500
The firomactal drive
is powered by...

694
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:55,208
Command lockout

701
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:49,375
Yes?

702
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:51,166
I found this in
the schoolroom.

703
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:53,041
Is it yours?

704
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,792
Hmm...

705
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,083
That's all of them except
for the two on the bridge.

706
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:18,500
Wait here until I return.

707
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,041
Yes, sir.

708
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,375
So, one more time,
the ramistat kiloquad

709
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:25,041
capacity is a function
of the square root

710
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,834
of the intermix ratio
times the sum of

711
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,000
the plasma injector
quotient...

712
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,542
Oh!

713
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:37,959
(<i> door chimes</i> )

714
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,583
Come in.

715
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,417
I believe you're
in my chair.

716
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:54,667
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46236.3.</i>

717
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:56,959
<i>We have taken Lurin</i>
<i>and his men into custody.</i>

718
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,125
<i>The Ferengi Alliance has</i>
<i>quickly disavowed</i>

719
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,333
<i>any knowledge</i>
<i>of these renegades.</i>

720
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,917
<i>With the mining</i>
<i>operation closed,</i>

721
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:04,625
<i>and our crew back</i>
<i>on board,</i>

722
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:06,375
<i>we can now</i>
<i>turn our attention</i>

723
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:07,750
<i>to other problems.</i>

724
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,041
Phase inducers
activated.

725
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:12,458
Energy levels nominal.

726
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,125
I'm loading
the adult patterns

727
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:15,709
into the buffer.

728
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,041
Transposition
matrix locked in.

729
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,166
That should do it,
Captain.

730
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,625
Energize.

731
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,417
How do you feel?

732
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,000
I feel fine.

733
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:04,625
Everything...

734
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,583
seems a little smaller.

735
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,166
It's my mother.

736
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,917
The funny thing is,

737
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:33,125
I never really drew a picture
of her when I was young.

738
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:35,667
It's just...

739
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:38,041
for some reason,
I wanted to now.

740
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:41,500
Well, that's the wonderful
thing about crayons.

741
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:44,500
They can take you to
more places than a starship.

742
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,250
It's my turn,
isn't it?

743
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:52,208
Only if you're ready.

744
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:58,667
It's not quite as bad
as I remembered it.

745
00:43:58,709 --> 00:44:00,291
Being a child,
I mean.

746
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,792
Mmm.

747
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:06,834
Well...

748
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,792
we better get going.

749
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:10,375
Well...

750
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,083
what's the hurry?

751
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:16,625
I mean, the transporter
will still be there.

752
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,458
Why don't you pass me
the royal blue?

753
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,875
Yeah.
Thank you.

754
00:44:24,917 --> 00:44:27,000
Okay, we can use
this one...

755
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,375
Did you do
this one, too?

756
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:30,625
Uh-huh.
I did all of them.

757
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:32,875
Oh.
