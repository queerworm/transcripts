1
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:07,583
One.

2
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:10,000
Are you trying to fill
another inside straight, Worf?

3
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:11,542
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,500
Pah!

5
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:17,208
I fold.

6
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:22,709
I will raise you...
three.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,250
No cards?

8
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,083
The best poker face
I've ever seen.

9
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,083
Dealer takes two.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,125
Your three, and...
ten more.

11
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:45,041
I will see your 10,
and raise you 20.

12
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,375
Data, have you got a flush
or a full house?

13
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,709
It will cost you 20
to make that determination, sir.

14
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:59,375
Dealer folds.

15
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:02,083
TROI:
You two have
successfully divided

16
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,625
the evening
between you.

17
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:07,333
I suspect conspiracy.

18
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:09,500
But far be it from me

19
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:11,917
to accuse my
superior officers.

20
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:14,166
You're getting harder
and harder to bluff, Data.

21
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,083
You've learned
this game very well.

22
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,542
Yes, sir,
I believe I have.

23
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,041
I'll tell you what.

24
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,667
I'll bet that
I can find any card

25
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,041
that you hide
in this deck.

26
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,291
And furthermore,

27
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,083
I will make you
help me find it.

28
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,917
Careful, Data.

29
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,959
Your guidance is much
valued, counselor.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,959
However...

31
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,208
Pick a card.

32
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:38,709
Don't let me see it.

33
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,125
Now, lose it
in the deck.

34
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,875
Cut the deck into
two even piles.

35
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,291
Okay.

36
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,583
One more time.

37
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,583
And again.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,083
How many cards?

39
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,291
11.
Take five.

40
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,083
Throw them away.

41
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:19,000
Pick three more.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,250
Okay, now pick
one of those.

43
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,291
That your card?

44
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,458
Incredible.

45
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,041
DATA:
Not at all,
Counselor.

46
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,250
You surreptitiously

47
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,875
placed the edge
of your left thumb

48
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:39,125
against the card.

49
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,917
When you divided
the deck to reshuffle

50
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,500
you kept that card
on top.

51
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:45,875
You thus were able to have me
either save or discard

52
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,709
depending upon the location
of the card,

53
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,667
which you followed
at each step

54
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,792
until we were left
with just one--

55
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,500
the card
I originally chose.

56
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,041
Sir...

57
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,542
I believe,
under the circumstances...

58
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,917
Picard to Riker.

59
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,166
Captain?

60
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,458
PICARD:
We have received
a distress call.

61
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,667
We're changing course
to intercept.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,250
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44215.2.</i>

63
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,959
<i>The</i> <i> Enterprise has bypassed</i>

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,291
<i>its scheduled archaeological</i>
<i>survey of Camus II</i>

65
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,041
<i>in response to</i>
<i>a distress call</i>

66
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,000
<i>from the Federation</i>

<i>orbit around Turkana IV...</i>

68

<i>birthplace of our late comrade,</i>
<i>Tasha Yar.</i>

69
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,166
We will be entering
the Turkana system

70
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,667
in 11 minutes, Captain.

71
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,166
PICARD:
Engine status?

72
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,792
Stable, but we have
maintained warp factor nine

73
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:38,500
for longer than
is recommended, sir.

74
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:41,125
Subspace message
from the<i> Arcos.</i>

75
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,125
Their transmitter
is failing.

76
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,208
Audio only.
Let's hear it.

77
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,834
<i>Enterprise,</i>
this is Tan Tsu,

78
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,417
<i>Arcos</i> engineer.
Estimate five minutes

79
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,041
'til warp drive
containment breach.

80
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,709
(<i> explosion</i> )

81
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,959
Make that three minutes.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,208
Thanks for trying,
<i>Enterprise.</i>

83
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,500
Ensign, warp factor 9.3.

84
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,583
How much time?

85
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,041
Seven minutes,
15 seconds

86
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,083
will put us within
transporter range, Captain.

87
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,917
9.6.

88
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:14,917
PICARD:
Mr. O'Brien,
prepare to lock

89
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,250
onto the two crewmen.
Aye, Captain.

90
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,083
DATA:
We are now entering
the Turkana system, sir.

91
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,041
Slow to impulse.

92
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,333
Visual contact,
sir.

93
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,041
Get them out of there,
O'Brien.

94
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,000
Status, O'Brien?

95
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,375
There's nothing to lock onto,
Commander.

96
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:34,875
I am reading
an ion trail

97
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:37,959
characteristic of a
freighter escape pod.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,709
Unable to establish
contact.

99
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,375
It could have been damaged
by the explosion.

100
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,000
They may have been able
to maintain orbit.

101
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,375
Let's hope they stay clear
of the colony.

102
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:47,834
That is exactly
where the ion trail

103
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,375
is leading,
Commander.

104
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:51,083
Hail the colony.

105
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,917
I've been trying to, Captain.
No response.

106
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,333
They haven't been able to
maintain reliable communications

107
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,917
since their government
fell apart.

108
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,959
The last Federation
vessel to make contact

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
was the<i> Potemkin</i>
six years ago.

110
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,417
They were warned
that anyone

111
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,542
transporting down to
the colony would be killed.

112
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:10,291
Number One...
ready an away team.

113
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:48,959
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,208
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship Enterprise.</i>

115
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,792
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

116
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:58,542
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

117
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:03,083
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

118
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:07,000
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

119
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,208
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

120
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,959
<i>We are in orbit above</i>
<i>Turkana IV, an earth colony</i>

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,750
<i>that severed relations</i>
<i>with the Federation</i>

122
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,625
<i>nearly 15 years ago.</i>

123
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,542
<i>I'm concerned</i>
<i>about sending an away team,</i>

124
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,417
<i>but if we are</i>
<i>to discover the fate</i>

125
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,792
<i>of the two missing</i>
<i>Federation crewmen,</i>

126
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:23,250
<i>I see no alternative.</i>

127
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,041
The surface settlement appears
to be all but destroyed.

128
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,667
Sensors show that the colonists
now live in structures

129
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:32,000
that extend nearly three
kilometers beneath the city.

130
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,333
RIKER:
Have you located
the escape pod's

131
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,917
landing point, Chief?
Yes, sir.

132
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,125
300 meters beyond
the colony perimeter.

133
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,375
Sir, we can anticipate

134
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,959
a violent response
to our presence.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,208
Perhaps the doctor

136
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,041
should wait here
until we signal.

137
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,166
I appreciate your concern.
I think it's exaggerated.

138
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,750
Doctor, the colony
is completely lawless.

139
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,583
Lieutenant Yar
spoke of rape gangs and--

140
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:56,583
Mr. Worf,
I can handle myself.

141
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,458
She's coming.
The<i> Arcos</i> crewmen

142
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,792
may need immediate
medical attention.

143
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:03,458
Set phasers
on maximum stun.

144
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Energize.

145
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,834
DATA:
The dispersion trail
continues in this direction.

146
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,125
The concentration gradient

147
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,583
definitely increases
along this vector.

148
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,709
The escape pod
was apparently moved

149
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,625
into the tunnels
ahead of us.

150
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,208
WOMAN:
Uh, excuse me.

151
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,834
RIKER:
Hardly the response
we expected.

152
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,542
MAN:
Pardon me.

153
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,750
Maybe things
have changed here.

154
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:49,959
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,166
MAN:
Over here.
Freeze!

156
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,125
Identify yourselves!

157
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,792
We're from the Federation
starship,<i> Enterprise.</i>

158
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,625
We've tracked two of
our crewmen to this area.

159
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:01,875
Do you know anything
about them?

160
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,667
Possibly.

161
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,709
What do you mean?

162
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,000
They found us.

163
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,375
Proximity detectors.

164
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,917
I've seen them used
on Manu III.

165
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,041
Follow me!

166
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,458
The Alliance is holding
your men hostage,

167
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,542
Commander Riker,
not us.

168
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,375
You can expect
a ransom demand.

169
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:25,542
The Alliance?

170
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,041
Our good friends.
(<i> men chuckle</i> )

171
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,417
Our "good friends"
are going to be upset

172
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,667
when they realize
we took

173
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,875
their last crate
of Telluridian synthale.

174
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,041
Maybe I should take this
to the authorities.

175
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,917
We<i> are</i> the authorities.

176
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:43,667
The Coalition-- our cadre--
runs this side of the city.

177
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,959
The Alliance controls
the other side.

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,125
Take your choice.

179
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,667
Are you offering
to help us?

180
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:51,041
In return for some
consideration.

181
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,417
Phasers are in short
supply down here.

182
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,417
A starship isn't going
to miss a few.

183
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,458
That is no better
than a ransom demand.

184
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,208
No matter what
you give the Alliance,

185
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,917
they'll eventually kill
your crewmen anyway.

186
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,417
With our help,
at least there's a chance

187
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,417
you'll get your men
back alive.

188
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,542
All I'm asking for is help
in maintaining our defense.

189
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,166
We are trying
to keep the peace.

190
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,333
Everything we've seen
would indicate otherwise.

191
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,208
(<i> chuckling</i> )
A prank.

192
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,583
Our proximity implants
prevent either side

193
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,291
from doing
any serious damage.

194
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,667
They warn us when
an enemy is approaching.

195
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,375
WORF:
Then why do you need
more phasers?

196
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,291
The Alliance just discovered
a large cache of weapons.

197
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,500
I'm just trying
to make things even,

198
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,125
to preserve the peace.

199
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,458
You keep using
the word "peace."

200
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,750
We've heard
a different version

201
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:38,041
of life on Turkana IV.

202
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,333
Ancient history.

203
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,500
Where did you hear that?

204
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,458
A former crewman
was born here.

205
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,959
Where is he now?

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,125
<i>She</i> was killed
in the line of duty.

207
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,709
Well, that's as good a way
to die as any.

208
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,834
As I said,
ancient history.

209
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,375
This is now
and your men are in trouble.

210
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,834
We'll return
to the<i> Enterprise</i>

211
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,000
and consider
your proposal.

212
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,250
A gift for
your captain.

213
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:12,458
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i> 
Energize.

214
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,291
I want everything
there is to know

215
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,041
about the starship
<i>Enterprise.</i>

216
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,625
According to Hayne,
the Coalition and the Alliance

217
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:33,166
raid each other for supplies,
much of it non-essential.

218
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,500
Why?
A battle exercise.

219
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:36,875
Their defenses
apparently prevent

220
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:38,667
deep strikes into
each other's territory.

221
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:40,667
Minor skirmishes
are all that's left.

222
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,667
"Coalition," "Alliance."

223
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:45,250
It all sounds so reasonable,
but what you've described

224
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,375
is the behavior
of urban street thugs.

225
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,792
I certainly won't trade
weapons for crewmen.

226
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:52,792
How do you suggest
we deal with them?

227
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:54,250
We have to tell them
something.

228
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,083
No promises, no denials.

229
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,208
For now,
Hayne's Coalition

230
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,333
is our only safe access
to the colony.

231
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,625
We'll keep the door open.
See where it leads us.

232
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:05,166
Captain...

233
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,792
transmission coming in
from Turkana IV.

234
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,041
On a secure channel.

235
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,291
On screen.

236
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,083
HAYNE:
Hello,<i> Enterprise.</i>

237
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,583
Commander Riker, would you
introduce me to your captain?

238
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,959
I'm Captain
Jean-Luc Picard.

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,083
I have someone here

240
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,709
you might like to meet.

241
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,417
This is Ishara.
Ishara Yar.

242
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,542
Tasha was my sister.

243
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,709
HAYNE:
There's an old saying,
Captain.

244
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,375
"The enemy of my enemy
is my friend."

245
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,083
I've decided it's
in my best interest

246
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,709
to help you get
your crewmen back.

247
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,792
With nothing from us
in return?

248
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,667
You could be forced
into paying my adversary

249
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,333
a ransom in weapons.

250
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,500
I'll do anything I can
to avoid that possibility.

251
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,250
What do you propose?

252
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,458
Ishara will be
our liaison.

253
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,458
I know Alliance
territory.

254
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,667
I can help you
with a rescue plan.

255
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,458
One moment.

256
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,542
Mute.
Reactions?

257
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,792
I do not trust him.

258
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,375
RIKER:
She could be
a fake.

259
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:16,709
We told them a member of our
crew was from the colony.

260
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,000
All Hayne had to do was
to search through their database

261
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,583
on Starfleet
to find Tasha's name.

262
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,834
Counselor?

263
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,083
He's deceiving us,

264
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,375
and he's clearly hoping
to manipulate us.

265
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:30,291
As for the identity
of the young woman,

266
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,041
I can't really tell.

267
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,000
Nevertheless, this is an option
we cannot neglect.

268
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,000
We'll continue on other fronts
as they present themselves.

269
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,041
For now, let's see
what she has to say.

270
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,917
WORF:
Open.

271
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,500
I have decided
to accept your proposal.

272
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,667
Thank you.

273
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:51,333
Good luck.

274
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,750
DATA:
Welcome to the
<i>Enterprise,</i> Ishara.

275
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,709
I am Commander Data.

276
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,583
You're not human.

277
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,000
I am an android.

278
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,291
Built for fighting?

279
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:16,542
On what do you base
that assumption?

280
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,125
A cybernetic device
serving on a starship.

281
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,250
The<i> Enterprise</i>
is not a ship of war.

282
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,000
It is a ship
of exploration.

283
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:27,375
The first thing to do is
to help you map the colony.

284
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:29,458
This is a general grid
of the tunnel system.

285
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,291
I can fill in the specific
details from memory.

286
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,625
My orders are
to escort you

287
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,083
to the observation
lounge.

288
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,250
Please come
with me.

289
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,583
Your sister never
spoke of you.

290
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,291
That's not surprising.

291
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,041
It is surprising
to me.

292
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,417
Tasha and I spent
much time together.

293
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,792
We had a number
of conversations.

294
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:55,208
Did she talk at all
about the colony?

295
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,250
Only to say that she was
lucky to have escaped.

296
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,583
It wasn't luck.
It was cowardice.

297
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,583
"Cowardice"
is a term I have

298
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,083
never heard applied
to Tasha.

299
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,041
Is something wrong?

300
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,250
No.

301
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,458
It is just that,
for a moment,

302
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,291
the expression
on your face

303
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,000
reminded me
of her.

304
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,291
It's been 15 years.

305
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,709
I don't even remember
what she looked like.

306
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,875
You don't believe
I'm Tasha's sister.

307
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,166
We have considered
the possibility.

308
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,500
I'm not surprised.

309
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:48,709
You can sample my DNA,
if you'd like.

310
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,875
Yes, I will.

311
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,166
PICARD:
Please, sit down.

312
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,500
Thank you.

313
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,083
Perhaps it would help
if you gave us some idea

314
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,083
of what we're dealing
with on Turkana IV.

315
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,583
The last information

316
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,458
describes a colony in
almost complete disarray.

317
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,583
It started falling apart
almost 30 years ago.

318
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,000
There were dozens
of factions.

319
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,875
They fought until the city
above ground was in ruins.

320
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,208
The Coalition and
the Alliance

321
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,625
are all
that's left?

322
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,792
We were the two
strongest factions.

323
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,625
When the government
couldn't stop the violence,

324
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:31,750
they gave us police powers.

325
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,125
The proximity detectors

326
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,917
were originally designed
by the government

327
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,542
to keep us
under control.

328
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,041
Apparently, that part of the
plan didn't work very well.

329
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,417
No.
After a few months...

330
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,542
we didn't need
the government anymore.

331
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,875
Tasha left you in
the middle of all that?

332
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:49,166
She didn't abandon me,
if that's what you mean.

333
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,166
Tasha asked me
to go with her,

334
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,709
but I had already joined
the Coalition.

335
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,583
They were my family.

336
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,792
Captain, we don't have
a lot of time.

337
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:01,500
Maybe we should
get started.

338
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:04,166
WORF:
Incoming transmission
from the colony, Captain.

339
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,709
On screen.

340
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,959
TAN TSU:
<i>Enterprise...</i>

341
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,333
I'm being held
by Turkana IV Alliance.

342
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,792
I've been instructed
to say

343
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,750
that you have 20 hours
to make reparations

344
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:18,041
for Federation intrusions
into this colony...

345
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,208
or my pilot and I...
will be killed.

346
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,250
Ask them if we can at least
send some medical--

347
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,208
(<i> static</i> )

348
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,041
Take that threat seriously,
Captain.

349
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,250
They'll torture them
and then they'll kill them.

350
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,500
My cadre has
never recovered

351
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,959
a hostage alive from
the Alliance.

352
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,959
Your crewmen could be held
in any number of places.

353
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,583
The Alliance
has two main headquarters

354
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,750
and 13 ancillary bases
of operation.

355
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:43,250
All underground,
all heavily guarded.

356
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,709
LA FORGE:
Captain, if I could get to
the myographic scanner...

357
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,917
What's that?
A sensing device

358
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,375
from the escape pod.

359
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:51,917
It monitors the bioelectric
signatures of the crew

360
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,166
in the event they get
separated from the pod.

361
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,542
I could install a booster
on the device

362
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,709
that would relay its signals

363
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,125
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

364
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,208
Then we could track
the men from up here.

365
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,458
Unfortunately, we don't know
where the escape pod is.

366
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,875
Level 3-C, section 547.

367
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,709
We have our sources.

368
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:19,083
Access tunnels
are here and here.

369
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,333
We could transfer
the away team

370
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,917
right into
this intersection.

371
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,750
Don't underestimate them,
Commander.

372
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,333
They'll be ready
for that.

373
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,667
I've seen them use
this kind of strategy before.

374
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:31,125
I know it looks isolated
and easily accessible,

375
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,667
but my guess is
they have hundreds

376
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:34,000
on the levels above and below

377
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,125
just waiting for you
to make your move.

378
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,792
We will need
a diversion.

379
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,166
Transport a couple
of photon grenades

380
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,667
into the adjoining
chamber.

381
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,667
At minimum intensity,
it wouldn't kill anybody

382
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:44,375
but it would
shake them up a bit.

383
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:45,875
That won't give us
enough time.

384
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,166
We need to occupy them
long enough

385
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,917
for you
to install the relay.

386
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,125
Transport me into
this corridor.

387
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,000
My magnetic implant will
set off the defense alarms.

388
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,417
They'll think it's a raid
by the Coalition.

389
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,625
Too dangerous.

390
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,041
We've seen what
those tunnels look like.

391
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,208
You could be easily cut off
from the rest of us.

392
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,208
Worf...

393
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,667
Commander Riker,
I was ordered

394
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,458
to assist you
in any way possible.

395
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,166
That doesn't mean "as long
as it's safe or convenient."

396
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,959
if you had the time, we could
come up with another plan

397
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,125
but you don't.

398
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,625
Right now,
I'm your best option.

399
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,208
She would have

400
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,625
to be armed, sir.

401
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,667
I'd like to discuss this
with the captain.

402
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:23,291
Take Ishara down
to see Dr. Crusher.

403
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,959
You have Tasha's DNA on file?

404
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,542
CRUSHER:
The ship's
computer does.

405
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,500
There's always
some differentiation

406
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,834
between sonomic chromosomes

407
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,333
but not enough
to affect results.

408
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,375
It should take me a few hours
to run the sonomic comparison.

409
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,792
That wasn't too bad.

410
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,125
So all that's left
of my sister

411
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,250
is a file in a computer.

412
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:00,542
Tasha exists in our
memories as well.

413
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,625
How did she die?

414
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,583
Lieutenant Yar was
killed on Vagra II

415
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,959
by a malevolent entity.

416
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,709
In battle.

417
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,834
No, she was killed

418
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,250
as a demonstration
of the creature's power.

419
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,583
Without provocation.

420
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,834
That's not how I intend to die.

421
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,083
The captain approves.

422
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,750
You're with us.

423
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,458
<i>Enterprise,</i> we're
in position.

424
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,959
PICARD:
Mr. O'Brien, energize.

425
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,166
Aye, Captain.

426
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:05,250
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

427
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:10,709
They're in level two.

428
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,166
Tunnel 16.

429
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,667
Come on.

430
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:14,709
Yosh, you're with us.

431
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,792
Spread out.

432
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,834
(<i> groaning</i> )

433
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,375
Go check five.

434
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:31,583
Yes, sir.

435
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,375
Check out three!

436
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,792
(<i> patrols calling</i>
<i>to each other</i> )

437
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,375
(<i> proximity alarm beeping</i> )

438
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:49,917
Somebody's here.
Watch your back.

439
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,041
I'm right behind you.

440
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,125
I thought it was in here.

441
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,500
This way.
We have movement.

442
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,250
This way.
Go, go, go.

443
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:00,083
Damn!

444
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,208
Geordi, what is
taking so long?

445
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,542
There's a lot
of damage here.

446
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,875
The myographic scanner
is operational

447
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:05,458
but the power source
keeps fluctuating.

448
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,875
Can you fix it?

449
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:08,542
I can probably run a shunt
from the converter.

450
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,542
How long will it take?

451
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,542
Ten minutes?

452
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,291
Do it.

453
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,041
O'Brien, lock onto Ishara.
Get her out of here.

454
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,959
There's a transformer substation

455
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,375
directly above the chamber
she just entered.

456
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:24,000
It's masking her signal.

457
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,417
Stand by.

458
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,917
Stay here and cover La Forge.

459
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,583
Commander...
That's an order.

460
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,000
Return to the ship as
soon as you're finished.

461
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,875
I'll signal for transport
as soon as I can.

462
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:40,500
(<i> proximity alarm beeping</i> )

463
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,500
(<i> yells</i> )

464
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,125
Get us out of here.

465
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,792
Energizing.

466
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,583
(<i> door chimes</i> )

467
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,792
Come.

468
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,250
How is she?

469
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,417
Couple of cracked ribs.
She'll be all right.

470
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,125
Dr. Crusher just called me

471
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,333
with the results
of the DNA comparison.

472
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,917
Ishara is Tasha's sister.

473
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:32,750
After what she did for us
down there

474
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:34,583
that doesn't surprise me
one bit.

475
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:38,000
You took some unnecessary
personal risks, Number One.

476
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,250
We lost Tasha on an away team
under my command.

477
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:46,250
The thought of the same thing
happening to her sister...

478
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,166
That's an emotional response,
Will.

479
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,333
We can't afford it.

480
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:52,333
Understood.

481
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,542
Commander.

482
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,375
Well done.

483
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,250
I've fused the bone tissue
along both fractures.

484
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:12,542
The muscles around the area
will be weak for a day or two

485
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:13,959
but you shouldn't
feel any pain.

486
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,166
Thank you, Doctor.

487
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,792
Ishara, I wanted
to thank you personally

488
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,875
for what you did for us
down on the colony.

489
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,583
It was more than I expected.

490
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:31,166
I don't run away when things
get tough, like some people.

491
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:34,542
Like my sister did.

492
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:40,417
Let me tell you
about your sister.

493
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,667
The first time
I saw Tasha Yar

494
00:24:43,709 --> 00:24:46,500
she was making her way
through a Carnelian minefield

495
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:48,375
to reach a wounded colonist.

496
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:50,917
Her ship had responded
to their distress call,

497
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:51,875
as had mine.

498
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:54,083
When it was all over

499
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,834
I requested that she be assigned
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

500
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:59,542
Her ship's captain
owed me a favor.

501
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,583
In the months
that followed

502
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,375
she never once failed

503
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:07,166
to put the safety of the crew
before her own

504
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:09,750
and she died doing the same.

505
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,583
I'm sorry
you never knew

506
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,333
the woman Tasha became.

507
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:18,542
I think you would have
been proud of her.

508
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,250
And she of you.

509
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,959
DATA:
What is this structure?

510
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
A main fusion source.

511
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,166
There's one next to each
of the Alliance headquarters.

512
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:35,000
It powers all of their
defensive systems.

513
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:37,333
This chamber is accessed
from the level below.

514
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:40,542
Entry points are evenly
spaced along this wall

515
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,667
every 25 meters.

516
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,917
Data, where was
Tasha's post?

517
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:52,417
Tactical Station--

518
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:54,875
where Lieutenant
Worf is now.

519
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:01,083
Did Tasha have
many friends here?

520
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,375
Yes.

521
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:03,625
She was especially close

522
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,417
to Commander Riker
and Lieutenant Worf

523
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,959
and to myself.

524
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,166
Are you able to have friends?

525
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,792
Yes.

526
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:16,041
But you don't have feelings,
do you?

527
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,417
Not as such.

528
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,709
However, even among humans

529
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,709
friendship is sometimes
less an emotional response

530
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,875
and more a sense
of familiarity.

531
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,458
So, you can become
used to someone.

532
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,291
Exactly.

533
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,417
As I experience certain
sensory input patterns

534
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:36,959
my mental pathways
become accustomed to them.

535
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,917
The input is eventually
anticipated

536
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:42,333
and even missed when absent.

537
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,500
Like my sister.

538
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:50,000
Yes.
Like your sister.

539
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,875
They've been moved
so far underground

540
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:57,959
it's been difficult
to pinpoint their signatures

541
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,250
but the men are here

542
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:01,625
next to one of the Alliance
headquarters.

543
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:02,792
That's about two kilometers

544
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:04,875
of solid granite
above their heads.

545
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,208
So much for the transporters.

546
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,625
Not necessarily.

547
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,208
We could use the ship's
phasers to cut a shaft

548
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,333
through the bedrock
to this storage tunnel here.

549
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:13,083
With a clear path
through the rock

550
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:15,083
we'd be able to transport
down through the tunnel.

551
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,583
That'll put us close enough
to get to the crewmen.

552
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,250
But I'll need two hours

553
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:21,417
to refit the ship's phasers
for drilling.

554
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:25,125
It's a real maze
down there.

555
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:27,083
I spent a lot of time
in that section

556
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,083
before they took it over.

557
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,792
There are blind
tunnels and dead ends

558
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:32,667
that don't even
show up on this map.

559
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:34,375
We do not have much choice.

560
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:38,375
If it wasn't for my implant
setting off all the alarms

561
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:39,917
I could guide you to your men.

562
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,750
We could remove the implant.

563
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:44,250
No, it has
a micro-explosive inside

564
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,333
that detonates
on contact with air.

565
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:50,041
When you join a cadre,
you join for life.

566
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:53,583
A small force field

567
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:55,583
containing xenon
or another inert gas

568
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,583
could be placed
over the incision site.

569
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:58,709
The explosive could

570
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,792
possibly be disarmed

571
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:02,291
at the same time
it is removed.

572
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,208
This is something
you're going

573
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,834
to have to decide
for yourself, Ishara.

574
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,583
Think about it
while we're waiting for Geordi.

575
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,834
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

576
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:24,291
Our parents were killed
in some cross fire

577
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,875
just after I was born.

578
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:33,125
Some people took care of us
for a few months, but then...

579
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:38,583
one day we came home
and they were gone.

580
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,875
So Tasha took care of me

581
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:44,500
and when I was old enough,
I joined the Coalition.

582
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:46,542
DATA:
Tasha did not.

583
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:49,250
My sister hated the cadres.

584
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:53,250
She blamed them
for our parents' death.

585
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:55,083
For everything.

586
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,834
No, she refused to join

587
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,875
and she left as soon
as she had the chance.

588
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I always thought
she was weak for doing that.

589
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:15,917
But... maybe I was wrong.

590
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:19,542
Maybe... maybe she made
the right choice.

591
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:29,375
To work together
for something besides killing.

592
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,750
To be close to someone

593
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:35,500
without always having
to protect your back.

594
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,583
Very appealing.

595
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,875
You're the perfect example.

596
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,875
I hardly even know you, Data,

597
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:53,917
but already
I completely trust you.

598
00:29:55,417 --> 00:30:00,875
I... I even consider you
a friend.

599
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,917
Thank you.

600
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:07,542
I would like to consider you
my friend as well.

601
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:17,625
If I had known about
this place 15 years ago

602
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:20,709
things might have
been different.

603
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,667
Maybe it's not too late.

604
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,250
Ishara is willing to have
the implant removed, sir.

605
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:44,291
Good, inform
Dr. Crusher.

606
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:47,417
She has also expressed
a desire to leave the colony.

607
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:48,834
She hopes to apply
to the academy

608
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:51,750
and eventually
join Starfleet.

609
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,458
Does she understand

610
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,333
the magnitude
of these decisions?

611
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,875
She claims to, Captain.

612
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:01,417
I get a sense of ambiguity
from her.

613
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,083
Her loyalties are clearly
divided, Captain.

614
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,583
Are you suggesting

615
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:07,000
we should deny her an escape
from this environment?

616
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:10,875
No, I'm just not sure
she wants to escape.

617
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:12,667
It's the only way of life
she's ever known.

618
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:17,667
Ultimately, it is her decision
to make, not ours.

619
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:23,041
Mr. Data, proceed
with the mission as planned.

620
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,709
Data?

621
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,875
Yes, Counselor?

622
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:33,500
You seem so strong
in your support.

623
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:36,166
I'm curious.

624
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,792
We must free the crewmen.

625
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:40,709
She appears to be
our best hope of doing so.

626
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,959
In addition...

627
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:47,208
I have become used to her.

628
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,375
Ishara.

629
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:02,583
Thank you, Data.

630
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,250
You are welcome.

631
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:08,166
Dr. Crusher is expecting
you in Sick Bay.

632
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,875
It's all so different.

633
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:12,083
To what are you referring?

634
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,834
On the colony, nobody does
anything for anyone else

635
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,458
unless they have something
to gain from it.

636
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,166
But I do have something
to gain from it.

637
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:22,792
Your continued presence
on the ship.

638
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,291
Is something wrong?

639
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:30,417
I have to tell Hayne
and the others.

640
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:33,500
I owe it to them.

641
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:35,709
Guess I ought
to get it over with.

642
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,041
If you desire privacy

643
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,333
you may use
the Observation Lounge.

644
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:42,583
That would probably make things
a little easier.

645
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,083
Hmm.

646
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:57,333
Report.

647
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,208
It's working.

648
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,125
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44225.3.</i>

649
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,667
<i>Dr. Crusher has</i>

650
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:11,417
<i>Ishara's magnetic implant</i>

651
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:14,250
<i>enabling the young woman</i>

652
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,959
<i>Without my intending it</i>

653
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,458
<i>she has virtually become</i>
<i>an active member of the crew.</i>

654
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,375
CRUSHER:
Cardiovascular
functions normal.

655
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,166
Metabolism, immunity,

656
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:29,000
all other vital signs excellent.

657
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,000
How do you feel?

658
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:35,375
Better than I've ever felt.

659
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:42,083
Thanks for staying with me.

660
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,333
You might want
to keep this.

661
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:46,875
It's been with you
a long time.

662
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:54,917
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

663
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:57,917
You keep it, Data.

664
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,375
So you won't forget me.

665
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,041
Have you
reconsidered

666
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,542
your decision
to stay with us?

667
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,291
No.

668
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,041
Just in case something
goes wrong down there.

669
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,166
I understand you wish
to join Starfleet.

670
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,709
Someday...
if I'm lucky.

671
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,208
On that day, it is<i> we</i>
who will be lucky.

672
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,792
Picard to Riker.
Is your away team ready?

673
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,166
Waiting for
your signal, sir.

674
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,000
Status, Mr. La Forge.

675
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,208
Phasers in alignment
and ready to fire.

676
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,166
How far must we penetrate

677
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:35,667
to safely allow
transport function?

678
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:38,750
1.6 kilometers.

679
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:40,959
Fire phasers.
Aye, sir.

680
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,792
1.3 kilometers.

681
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:54,041
1.4...

682
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,542
1.5 kilometers.

683
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:56,917
1.6 kilometers.

684
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:58,583
Deep enough for
transport, sir.

685
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,375
Cease fire.

686
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,834
Mr. O'Brien, energize.

687
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:12,542
This way.

688
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:23,750
Caution is indicated.

689
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:25,959
We're near the heart
of the Alliance.

690
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,333
Security is minimal here.

691
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,709
They aren't expecting
anybody this far in.

692
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,375
Ishara?

693
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:32,959
Follow me.

694
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,333
Are you certain?

695
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:46,750
No, I'm not.

696
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:48,917
I'm trying to remember.

697
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:52,625
I was here,
but it was a long time ago.

698
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,500
There've been changes.

699
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:55,959
It's through here.

700
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,875
ISHARA:
There.

701
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:04,667
Your men are
behind that door.

702
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,250
(<i> screams</i> )

703
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,792
Hold out
your hands.

704
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:39,959
(<i> yells</i> )

705
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:49,041
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

706
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:54,959
Let's get moving!

707
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,333
Where is she?

708
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:58,959
Commander, look!

709
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,375
What the hell happened here?

710
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:03,500
She probably tried
to draw their fire.

711
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:05,125
It triggered the alarm.

712
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:06,834
Worf, get these men
back to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

713
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:07,917
Come on!

714
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,500
Data, you're with me.

715
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,458
DATA:
Ishara?

716
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:35,875
What are you doing?

717
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:40,792
(<i> slowly escalating hum</i> )

718
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:43,875
The fusion generator
is overloading.

719
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:47,625
You are attempting
to disable the defense system.

720
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:48,959
For what reason?

721
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,208
We have rescued
the crewmen.

722
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,542
I don't care about your crewmen.

723
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:56,750
We have 3,000 troops
waiting at the perimeter.

724
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:59,291
When the defenses go down,
they'll come in.

725
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,417
The Alliance will fall.

726
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:04,208
The Federation
will be responsible

727
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,041
for the resulting deaths.

728
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,417
I cannot allow that.

729
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,834
You don't have a choice.

730
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,542
That is not so.

731
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:15,041
I don't want to kill you, Data.

732
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,417
But I will.

733
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:28,583
We will both be destroyed
by the explosion.

734
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:32,291
The Coalition's been
all I've had for 15 years.

735
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,458
They've given me a life.

736
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,709
I don't mind dying for them.

737
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,333
But you won't have to
if you just get out of here now.

738
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,792
Was this your intention
from the beginning?

739
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,458
We never could have gotten

740
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,208
this deep into Alliance
territory without your help.

741
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,166
Our help was not deliberate.

742
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:49,625
You deceived us.

743
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:52,041
What's the difference?
You got what you came for.

744
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:54,166
Why do you care
about what we do?

745
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,959
Your friendship with me was part
of the deception, was it not?

746
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,750
You misled me
at each step

747
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:02,959
and yet,
I was completely unaware.

748
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,667
That doesn't matter now.
None of it does.

749
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:07,750
Now, get out of here, Data,
please!

750
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:09,166
Now!

751
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:11,667
My duty requires me
to intercede.

752
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:12,792
Ishara!

753
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:16,542
(<i> groans</i> )

754
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:21,000
What was she doing?

755
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,583
Disabling the
detection system

756
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,792
so her forces
could attack.

757
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:26,417
Set to kill.

758
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,625
Your strategy failed.

759
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:52,458
It was a calculated risk.

760
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,917
You gave us an opportunity
we couldn't ignore.

761
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:58,125
Ishara, are you hurt?

762
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:59,917
No.

763
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,875
I want her returned immediately.

764
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:04,166
You're in no position
to dictate to anybody.

765
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,500
She attacked
two Federation officers.

766
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,542
You have no
jurisdiction here.

767
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:09,834
Don't talk about legal rights.

768
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,583
Your jurisdiction
is based entirely

769
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,125
on the threat of violence.

770
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:15,875
You have your crewmen back.
Isn't that enough?

771
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:17,125
RIKER:
What do you know about...?

772
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:29,583
Commander Data, escort Ishara
to the transporter room.

773
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,417
Thank you, Captain.
I'm just trying to make...

774
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:33,500
Close the channel.

775
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:34,917
...to preserve the peac...

776
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:45,667
You're far more charitable
than I would have been, Captain.

777
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:48,750
I understand your
feelings, Number One.

778
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:50,959
I share them

779
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,083
but perhaps the fault
lies in ourselves.

780
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,709
We were so eager
to accept her.

781
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,917
Each of us

782
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:59,417
myself included,
wanted to see

783
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,208
something of Tasha
in this woman.

784
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,917
We saw more than was there.

785
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,500
You haven't said
one word to me.

786
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:17,250
What do you wish
to talk about?

787
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,709
I did what I had to do.

788
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,959
I'm sorry if I hurt you
in the process.

789
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,750
I am an android.

790
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,834
It is not possible
for me to be injured

791
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:38,000
in that fashion.

792
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,542
O'BRIEN:
Whenever you're ready.

793
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:52,792
You know, Data, I wasn't
always lying to you.

794
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:55,583
That time
we spent talking...

795
00:41:55,625 --> 00:42:00,625
that was the closest thing
to friendship I've ever had.

796
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:05,750
If that means anything to you.

797
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,834
Energize.

798
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

799
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:33,583
Come in.

800
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,625
Data, what's on your mind?

801
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:41,250
Recent events have
left me puzzled, sir.

802
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,792
It has been days
since Ishara left

803
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:46,208
and yet, my thoughts
seem to dwell on her

804
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,542
almost as if
I were experiencing

805
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:50,125
a feedback loop in
my mnemonic network.

806
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,625
I know what you mean.

807
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:56,041
It is curious that
I was so easily misled.

808
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:58,000
Make that "we."

809
00:42:58,041 --> 00:42:59,917
Yes, sir.

810
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:01,625
Data, sit down.

811
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,583
Thank you, sir.

812
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:10,041
In all trust

813
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:13,083
there is the possibility
of betrayal.

814
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:17,208
I'm not sure
you were prepared for that.

815
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,500
Were you
prepared, sir?

816
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:21,917
I don't think
anybody ever is.

817
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:25,041
Hmm.

818
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:26,959
Then it is better not to trust.

819
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:33,375
Without trust, there's no
friendship, no closeness.

820
00:43:33,417 --> 00:43:35,917
None of the emotional bonds
that make us who we are.

821
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:38,417
And yet you put yourself
at risk.

822
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:41,667
Every single time.

823
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:44,667
Perhaps I am fortunate, sir,

824
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:48,166
to be spared
the emotional consequences.

825
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,875
Perhaps.
