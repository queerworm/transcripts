1
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:08,291
Captain, I have
identified the signal.

2
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,333
It is from
the USS<i> Jenolan--</i>

3
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:11,875
a Federation
transport ship

4
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:14,625
reported missing in
this sector 75 years ago.

5
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:17,083
Code one alpha zero--
ship in distress.

6
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:19,208
Take us out of warp,
Ensign, all stop.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,041
Aye, sir.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,500
Report.

9
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:27,583
We have entered a massive
gravitational field, Captain.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,208
There are no stars
or other stellar bodies

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,083
listed on our
navigational charts.

12
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,000
However, sensors indicate the
presence of an extremely strong

13
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,208
gravitational source
in this vicinity.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,291
Can you localize the source
of the gravitational field?

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,834
RIKER:
Sensors?

16
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,125
DATA:
I am having difficulty
scanning the object.

17
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,542
It appears to be
approximately

18
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,959
200 million kilometers
in diameter.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,208
That's nearly as large as the
Earth's orbit around the sun.

20
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:58,500
Why didn't we detect this
before now?

21
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,083
The object's enormous mass

22
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,458
is causing a great deal
of gravimetric interference.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,583
That might have prevented
our sensors from detecting it

24
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,542
before we dropped
out of warp.

25
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,333
Mr. Data...

26
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,000
could this be
a Dyson sphere?

27
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,667
The object does fit the general
parameters of Dyson's theory.

28
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:19,291
A Dyson sphere?

29
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,917
It's a very old theory,
Number One.

30
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,750
I'm not surprised
that you haven't heard of it.

31
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,041
In the 20th century,
a physicist called Freeman Dyson

32
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,208
postulated the theory
that an enormous,

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,375
hollow sphere could be
constructed around a star.

34
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:35,125
This would have
the advantage of harnessing

35
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,125
all the radiant energy
of that star,

36
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:40,709
and any population living
on the interior surface

37
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,500
would have virtually
inexhaustible sources of power.

38
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,792
Are you saying you think there
are people living in there?

39
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:49,000
Possibly a great number
of people, Commander.

40
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,375
The interior surface area
of a sphere this size

41
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:55,959
is the equivalent of more than
250 million Class-M planets.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,208
Sir, I have located
the distress signal.

43
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,625
It is coming from a point
in the northern hemisphere.

44
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,959
Ensign Rager, put us
into synchronous orbit

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,291
above that position.
RAGER: Aye, sir.

46
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,333
I have located
the<i> Jenolan,</i> sir.

47
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,417
It has impacted on
the surface of the sphere.

48
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,083
PICARD:
Magnify.

49
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,667
DATA:
There are no life signs.

50
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,500
However, there are several
small power emanations,

51
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,291
and life support is still
functioning on minimal levels.

52
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,583
Riker to Engineering.
Geordi,

53
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,041
join us in
Transporter Room three.

54
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,542
Mr. Worf.

55
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,083
This air is pretty stale.

56
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,542
Life support is
barely operating.

57
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,125
See if you can increase
the oxygen level.

58
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,583
Aye, sir.

59
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,792
Commander.

60
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:16,792
The transporter is
still online.

61
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,542
It's being fed power from
the auxiliary systems.

62
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,208
The rematerialization
subroutine has been disabled.

63
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,125
Yeah, and that's not all.

64
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,333
The phase inducers are connected
to the emitter array.

65
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,500
The override is
completely gone,

66
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:32,834
and the pattern
buffer's been locked

67
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,750
into a continuous
diagnostic cycle.

68
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,542
This doesn't
make any sense.

69
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,291
Locking the unit
into a diagnostic mode

70
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,625
just sends the matter array
through a pattern buffer.

71
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:45,417
Why would anyone...
There's a pattern
in the buffer still.

72
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,333
It's completely intact.

73
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:53,667
There's less than .003%
signal degradation.

74
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,041
How is that possible?
I don't know.

75
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,333
I've never seen
a transporter

76
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,625
jury-rigged
like this before.

77
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,417
Could someone survive
inside a transporter buffer

78
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,250
for 75 years?

79
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,917
I know a way
to find out.

80
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:10,875
(<i> transporter energizing</i> )

81
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:55,125

Well, thank you, lads.

88
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,834
Oh, well, we got to get
Franklin out of there.

89
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,792
Someone else's pattern
is still in the buffer?

90
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:20,375
Aye, Matt Franklin.

91
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:21,583
We went in together.

92
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,667
(<i> console beeping</i> )

93
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,667
Something's wrong.

94
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:28,417
One of the inducers
has failed.

95
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,625
Boost the gain
on the matter stream.

96
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:33,542
Come on, Franklin.

97
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,458
I know you're still
in there.

98
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

99
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,375
It's no use.

100
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:45,458
His pattern has
degraded 53%.

101
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,041
He's gone.

102
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,792
I'm sorry.
So am I.

103
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,834
He was a good lad.

104
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,959
I'm Commander William Riker,

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,291
starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

106
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,291
Lieutenant Commander
Geordi La Forge.

107
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,583
The<i> Enterprise?</i>

108
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,667
I should have known.

109
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,500
I bet Jim Kirk himself

110
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,166
hauled the old gal
out of mothballs

111
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,333
to come looking for me.

112
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,166
Captain Montgomery Scott.

113
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,208
Tell me, how long
have I been missing?

114
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,875
Well...
WORF: Sir.

115
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,250
I have restored
life support.

116
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,834
The oxygen levels will
return to normal shortly.

117
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,291
Captain Scott,
Lieutenant Worf.

118
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:31,000
Lieutenant?
Yes.

119
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,250
Captain, perhaps there are a
few things we should talk about.

120
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,208
We should probably
get you to Sick Bay.

121
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,500
Dr. Crusher will
want to have...

122
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:54,041
You've changed
the resonator array.

123
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,834
Geordi, I think our guest
is going to have

124
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,375
a lot of
engineering questions.

125
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:59,709
Not to worry, Commander,
I'll take care of him.

126
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,750
What have you done with
the duotronic enhancers?

127
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:10,917
Well, those were replaced
with isolinear chips

128
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,208
about 40 years ago.

129
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,834
It's a lot more
efficient now.

130
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,583
Oh! That's an EPS
power tap there.

131
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,417
Ah.

132
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,041
So you were saying
a little earlier

133
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,750
that you were on your way
to the Norpin colony

134
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,875
when you experienced
warp engine failure?

135
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:26,000
Aye, that's right.

136
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,333
See, we had an overload

137
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,458
in one of the plasma
transfer conduits,

138
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,458
and the captain
brought us out of warp,

139
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,125
and we hit some
gravimetric interference,

140
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,000
and there it was,
as big as life.

141
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,583
Oh, is that
a conduit interface?

142
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,875
Yeah, it is.

143
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:44,041
You were saying,
it's "as big as life."

144
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,417
You mean
the Dyson sphere.

145
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,500
Aye, an actual
Dyson sphere.

146
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:51,083
Can you imagine
the engineering skills

147
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,583
needed to even design
such a structure?

148
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,458
Yeah, I know.
It's pretty amazing.

149
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,166
So, what happened when
you first approached it?

150
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,375
Well, we began our standard
survey of the surface,

151
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:04,125
and we were just completing
the initial orbital scan

152
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,417
when our aft power coil
suddenly exploded.

153
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,500
The ship got caught
in the sphere's gravity well,

154
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,500
and down we went.

155
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,542
Franklin and I were
the only ones

156
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,291
to survive the crash.

157
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,500
Can I ask you
a question?

158
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,125
What in the world
made you think

159
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,917
of using the transporter
pattern buffer to survive?

160
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,792
Well, we...

161
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:28,709
didn't have enough supplies
to wait for the rescue,

162
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,291
so we had to think
of something.

163
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,667
Yeah, but locking it
into a diagnostic cycle

164
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:35,834
so that the pattern
wouldn't degrade

165
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,750
and then cross-connecting it
with the phase inducers

166
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:40,041
to provide a regenerative
power source...

167
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,208
that's absolutely
brilliant.

168
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,000
Well, I think it was
only 50% brilliant

169
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,625
'cause Franklin
deserves better.

170
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,417
You know, I think
you're going to enjoy
the 24th century, Mr. Scott.

171
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,625
We've made some pretty
incredible advances
these last 80 years.

172
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,208
Well, from what
I've seen,

173
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,166
you've got a fine ship,
Mr. La Forge.

174
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,333
A real beauty here.

175
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,667
I must admit to being
a bit overwhelmed.

176
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:08,000
Hmm. Wait till you
see the Holodeck.

177
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,125
You have a hairline
fracture of the humerus.

178
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,250
It will ache for
a couple of days,

179
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,834
but it should be fine.

180
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,458
Oh, thank you.

181
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,041
Well, I'll say this
about your<i> Enterprise--</i>

182
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,875
the doctors are
a fair sight prettier.

183
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,667
I'm Jean-Luc Picard.

184
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:29,917
Welcome aboard
the<i> Enterprise,</i> Captain Scott.

185
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,542
Thank you, sir,
and call me Scotty.

186
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,917
How are you feeling?
I don't know.

187
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,083
How<i> am</i> I feeling?

188
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,959
Other than a few
bumps and bruises,

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,500
I'd say you feel fine
for a man of 147.

190
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:44,917
And I don't feel
a day over 120.

191
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,667
I must say,
I was a little surprised

192
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:49,083
when Commander Riker
told me that you were

193
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,792
on board the<i> Jenolan.</i>

194
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:53,333
Our records didn't show you
listed as a member of the crew.

195
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,834
Well, I was never actually
a member of the crew.

196
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,792
I was...
just a passenger.

197
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:01,542
I was heading
for Norpin V

198
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,250
to settle down
and enjoy my retirement.

199
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,458
I see. Well, I would
very much enjoy

200
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,959
the opportunity of hearing
you talk about your career.

201
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,917
I'm sure you would have
some fascinating insights

202
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,625
into the events
of your time.

203
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,500
I'd be happy to.
Good.

204
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, I look forward to it.
Excuse me.

205
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,458
Commander,
we need to begin

206
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,875
a full spectrograph analysis
of the Dyson sphere.

207
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,625
I'll get right on it, sir.
Good.

208
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,834
Once again,
welcome on board, Captain.
Sir.

209
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,000
I need to get down
to Engineering and
begin that analysis.

210
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,917
Engineering?
I thought you'd never ask.

211
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,458
(<i> groans</i> )

212
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,208
Captain, the first thing
you need to get

213
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,542
is some rest.

214
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,166
Now, this has been
a shock to your system

215
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,041
and I want you
to not push yourself.

216
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,875
We're pretty busy down there
anyway, Captain Scott.

217
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:41,542
I promise I'd be happy
to give you a tour

218
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,375
just as soon as
the doctor says it's okay.

219
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:46,333
I'll find someone to show you
your quarters.

220
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,834
Aye.

221
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,709
This is the food replicator
and your computer terminal.

222
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,208
Good Lord, man.
Where have you put me?

223
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,667
These are standard
guest quarters, sir.

224
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,792
I can try and find something
bigger if you want.

225
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,417
Bigger?

226
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,041
In my day,
even an admiral

227
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,125
wouldn't've had
such quarters on a starship.

228
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,625
You know,
I remember a time

229
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:22,417
we had to transport
the Dohlman of Elas.

230
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,000
You never heard anyone
whine and complain so much

231
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,709
about quarters
as she did.

232
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,375
The Holodecks,
Ten Forward,

233
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:30,083
and the gymnasium are
all at your disposal.

234
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,625
The computer can tell you
how to find them.

235
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,291
Until we issue you
a combadge,

236
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,750
just use one of these panels
if you need anything.

237
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,625
You know,
these quarters remind me

238
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:40,125
of a hotel room
in Argelius.

239
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,750
Oh, now there is a planet--

240
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,500
everything a man wants
right at his fingertips.

241
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:48,083
'Course on the first visit, I
got into a wee bit of trouble...

242
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,959
Excuse me, sir, but I have
to return to duty.

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,750
Oh.

244
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:57,750
Well, then...
thank you.

245
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,125
I want you to shut down
the warp engines

246
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,667
and recalibrate
the aft sensors

247
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,500
while I work on
the lateral array.
Aye, sir.

248
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,875
BARTEL:
Can I help you, sir?

249
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,375
SCOTTY: Oh, I don't
think so, lassie,

250
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,083
but I'll let you know
if you can.

251
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,458
BARTEL: Sir, this area is
restricted to authorized...

252
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,250
Bartel, it's okay.
I'll handle it.

253
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,333
Captain Scott,
this really isn't...
We're in Engineering.

254
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,917
Call me Scotty.

255
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,625
Scotty, this really isn't
a good time for a tour.

256
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:54,542
We're running a phase seven
survey of the Dyson sphere.

257
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,750
I'm not here
for a tour, laddie.

258
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,500
I'm here to help.

259
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,667
That's very kind,

260
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,333
but I'm sure
we can handle it.

261
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,917
I was a Starfleet engineer

262
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,250
for 52 years,
Mr. La Forge.

263
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,500
I think I'm still useful.

264
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,083
You're right,
we'd be grateful

265
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,166
for any help
you could give us.

266
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,208
Good.
Let's get to work.

267
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,709
Sensors indicate the presence
of a G-type star

268
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,500
at the center of the sphere.

269
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,959
There also appears to be
a Class-M atmosphere

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,875
clinging to
the interior surface.

271
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:34,166
Is there any indication
that the sphere is inhabited?

272
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,500
Not as yet, sir.

273
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,000
Our preliminary data suggests

274
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,750
it is still capable
of supporting life,

275
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,542
but we have been unable
to find any definite

276
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,333
signs of current
habitation.

277
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,917
Mr. Data, send out
a series of Class-4 probes

278
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,166
to survey the far side
of the sphere.

279
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,417
Perhaps we'll have
more luck with them.

280
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,291
Aye, sir.

281
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,709
Adjust the frequency
stabilization

282
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,208
of the main deflector dish...

283
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,542
Laddie, you need
to phase-lock

284
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,208
the warp fields
within three percent,

285
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,000
or they'll
become unstable.
What?

286
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:05,291
Well, look.
Here's the warp...
(<i> loud beeping</i> )

287
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,291
We use a multiphase

288
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,709
auto-containment
field now.

289
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,625
It's meant to operate
above three percent.

290
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,792
Oh, well...

291
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:16,000
that would
make the difference.

292
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,166
BARTEL:
We can restart the engines
in ten minutes, Commander.

293
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,542
Thank you, Lieutenant.

294
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,917
I remember a time

295
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,417
when the old<i> Enterprise</i> was
spiraling toward Psi 2000.

296
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,750
Yeah. Thank you.

297
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:31,000
And the captain wanted
to try a cold start

298
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,750
of the warp engines,

299
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,834
and I told him that without
a proper phase-lock,

300
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,125
it would take
at least 30 minutes.

301
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,917
"You cannot change the laws
of physics," I told him,

302
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,417
but he wouldn't believe me,
so I had to come up

303
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,875
with a whole new engine
start-up routine.

304
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:51,125
Do you know that your dilithium
crystals are going to fracture?

305
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,709
We re-composite
the crystals

306
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,333
while they're still<i> inside</i> 
the articulation frame.

307
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,500
Look, Mr. Scott, I'd love
to explain everything to you,

308
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,750
but the captain wants
this spectrographic analysis

309
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,917
done by 1300 hours.

310
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:34,083
Do you mind
a little advice?

311
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,208
Starfleet captains
are like children.

312
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,375
They want everything right now,
and they want it their way,

313
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,208
but the secret is
to give them

314
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,333
only what they need,
not what they want.

315
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,792
Yeah, well,
I told the captain I'd have

316
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,875
this analysis done
in an hour.

317
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:50,125
How long would it really take?

318
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,375
An hour.

319
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:53,709
Oh, you didn't
tell him how long

320
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,250
it would<i> really</i> take,
did you?

321
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,959
Well, of course I did.

322
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,750
Oh, laddie,
you've got a lot to learn

323
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:02,750
if you want people to think
of you as a miracle worker.

324
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,667
Now, listen...
Captain Scott...

325
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:07,542
I've tried to be patient,
I've tried to be polite,

326
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,458
but I've got a job
to do here,

327
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,166
and, quite frankly,
you're in the way.

328
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,208
I was driving starships

329
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,667
while your great-grandfather

330
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,083
was still in diapers!

331
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,500
I'd think you'd be a little
grateful for some help.

332
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:25,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

333
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,959
I'll leave you to work,
Mr. La Forge.

334
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,208
May I help you, sir?

335
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,458
Aye, lad.

336
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,208
Scotch. Neat.

337
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,417
Here you go, sir.

338
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,959
Thank you.

339
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,458
What in blazes is this?!

340
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,125
Didn't you order scotch?

341
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,583
Laddie,
I was drinking scotch

342
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,625
a hundred years
before you were born,

343
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:28,208
and I can tell you
that whatever this is,

344
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,333
it is definitely
not scotch.

345
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,834
I believe I may be
of some assistance.

346
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:36,000
Captain Scott is unaware
of the existence of synthehol.

347
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,875
Sy-synthehol?

348
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,041
Yes, sir.

349
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,417
It is an alcohol substitute

350
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,834
now being served
aboard starships.

351
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:46,208
It simulates the appearance,
taste, and smell of alcohol,

352
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,458
but the intoxicating effects
can be easily dismissed.

353
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,917
You're not quite, uh...
human, are you?

354
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,417
No, sir.
I am an android.

355
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,125
Lieutenant Commander Data.

356
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,250
(<i> sighs</i> )

357
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:03,083
Synthetic scotch,
synthetic commanders.

358
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,917
I believe Guinan does
keep a limited supply

359
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,667
of non-syntheholic products.

360
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:10,917
Perhaps one of them
would be to your liking.

361
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,417
What is it?

362
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,917
It is...

363
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,917
it is...

364
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,125
it is green.

365
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,792
Ahh!

366
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,875
COMPUTER:
Please enter program.

367
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:09,208
The android at the bar

368
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,291
said you could show me
my old ship.

369
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,875
Let me see it.

370
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,417
COMPUTER:
Insufficient data.

371
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,250
Please specify parameters.

372
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,917
The<i> Enterprise.</i>

373
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,834
Show me the Bridge
of the<i> Enterprise,</i>

374
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,333
you chattering piece of...

375
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,959
COMPUTER: There have been five
Federation ships with that name.

376
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,709
Please specify
by registry number.

377
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:37,583
NCC-1701.

378
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,875
No bloody "A," "B,"

379
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:44,750
"C," or "D."

380
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:48,333
COMPUTER: Program complete.
Enter when ready.

381
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:45,917
Here's to you, lads.

382
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,333
(<i> doors open</i> )

383
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,208
(<i> sighs</i> )

384
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,375
PICARD:
I hope I'm not interrupting.

385
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,667
I was just coming off duty,

386
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:10,792
and I wanted to see
how you were doing.

387
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:14,959
Oh, not at all,
not at all.

388
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,875
Would you have a drink
with me, Captain?

389
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,417
Thank you.

390
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,792
I don't know
what it is, exactly,

391
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,667
but I would be
real careful.

392
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:27,917
It's real...

393
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,875
Aldebaran whiskey.

394
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,083
Who do you think
gave it to Guinan?

395
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,542
Ah.

396
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,125
Constitution-class.

397
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,375
Aye.

398
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:49,458
You're familiar with them?

399
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,417
There's one in
the Fleet Museum, but...

400
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:56,792
but then, of course,
this is your<i> Enterprise.</i>

401
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,083
I actually served on two.

402
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,291
This was the first.

403
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:05,458
She was also the first ship
I ever served on

404
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,417
as Chief Engineer.

405
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:11,625
You know, I served
aboard 11 ships--

406
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:15,834
freighters, cruisers,
starships...

407
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,542
but this is the only one
I think of,

408
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,000
the only one I miss.

409
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:24,250
The first vessel
that I served on as captain

410
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,834
was called the<i> Stargazer.</i>

411
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:30,542
It was an overworked,
underpowered vessel,

412
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,583
always on the verge
of flying apart at the seams.

413
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,417
In every
measurable sense,

414
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,291
my<i> Enterprise</i> is
far superior,

415
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,250
but there are times,

416
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,959
when I would give
almost anything

417
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,417
to command
the<i> Stargazer</i> again.

418
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:50,208
It's like the first time
you fall in love.

419
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,458
You don't ever love a woman

420
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,417
quite like that again.

421
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,041
(<i> sighing</i> )
Well...

422
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,792
to the<i> Enterprise</i>

423
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:02,291
and the<i> Stargazer--</i>

424
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,959
old girlfriends
we'll never meet again.

425
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,041
What do you think
of the<i> Enterprise-D?</i>

426
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:18,083
She's a beauty,
with a good crew.

427
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,458
But?

428
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,125
But...

429
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,291
when I was here,

430
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:27,250
I could tell you the speed
that we were traveling

431
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,959
by the feel
of the deck plates.

432
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,083
But on your ship...

433
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,542
I feel like
I'm just in the way.

434
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,208
Well, 75 years is
a long time.

435
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:40,875
If you would care
to study some

436
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:42,291
technical
schematics or...

437
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,583
I'm not 18.

438
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:46,959
I can't start out
like a raw cadet.

439
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,750
No...

440
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:50,834
There comes a time
when a man finds

441
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,709
that he can't
fall in love again.

442
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:57,041
He knows
that it's time to stop.

443
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,333
I don't belong on your ship.

444
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,333
I belong on this one.

445
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,792
This was my home.

446
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:08,417
This is where
I had a purpose.

447
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,166
But it's not real.

448
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:16,417
It's just
a computer-generated fantasy.

449
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

450
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,500
And I'm just an old man
who's trying to hide in it.

451
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:23,709
Computer,

452
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,250
shut this
bloody thing off.

453
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,417
It's time I acted my age.

454
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,250
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come.

455
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,583
Mr. La Forge,
I understand

456
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,875
that before
the<i> Jenolan</i> crashed,

457
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:56,000
it had conducted an extensive
survey of the Dyson sphere.

458
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:58,458
Have we been able to access
any of those records?

459
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
We did try to download
their memory core,

460
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,417
but it was pretty heavily
damaged in the crash.

461
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,667
We actually haven't been able
to get much out of it.

462
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:08,125
Perhaps Captain Scott
could be of use

463
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,333
in accessing
that material.

464
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,917
It's possible.

465
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:16,500
He does know those systems
better than any of us.

466
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,500
I'll have Lieutenant Bartel
beam down with him.

467
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,208
Mr. La Forge...

468
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,333
I would like<i> you</i> to
accompany Captain Scott.

469
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,792
Me, sir?
Yes.

470
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:32,709
Look, this is not an order.

471
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,041
It's a request,
and it's one that

472
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,917
you must feel
perfectly free to decline.

473
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:41,458
You see, one of
the most important things

474
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,291
in a person's life
is to feel useful.

475
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:47,250
Now, Mr. Scott is
a Starfleet Officer,

476
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:51,417
and I would like him
to feel useful again.

477
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,208
I'll go with him, sir.

478
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,083
Thank you.

479
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:04,875
Commander, I believe I have
found something on the sphere

480
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,583
which could be
a communications device.

481
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,875
There is an antenna array

482
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:11,333
approximately 400,000
kilometers south

483
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:13,458
of our present position.

484
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,291
It is emitting low-intensity
subspace signals.

485
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,291
Can you open a channel?

486
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,500
No, sir, not from
our present orbit.

487
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:23,208
The array is currently
directed away from us.

488
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,208
Ensign, prepare to put us in
orbit above those coordinates.

489
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,417
Captain Picard
to the Bridge, please.

490
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,792
Are you feeling
all right?

491
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:37,709
Well, never get drunk
unless you're willing

492
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,500
to pay for it
the next day.

493
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,792
I'll manage.

494
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:44,458
Okay.

495
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,208
Energize.

496
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,917
DATA: Sensors indicate
that the large circle

497
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,709
is a portal or airlock

498
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,166
possibly leading to
the interior of the sphere.

499
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,959
This looks like
the front door.

500
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,375
Should we ring the bell?

501
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:19,959
Mr. Worf,

502
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,458
open a channel
to that communications array.

503
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,250
Aye, sir.

504
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,834
(<i> alarm wailing</i> )

505
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,125
Some kind of tractor beam
has locked onto us.

506
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,750
Helm, get us out of here.

507
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,667
We've lost main power.

508
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:35,917
Auxiliary power
down to 20%.

509
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:42,709
We are being pulled inside.

510
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:01,125
RAGER:
Auxiliary power failing.

511
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,041
The resonance frequency
of the tractor beams

512
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,875
is incompatible
with our power systems.

513
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:08,542
Warp and impulse engine relays
have been overloaded.

514
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,667
I am attempting
to compensate.

515
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,750
RAGER: The tractor beams
have released us, sir.

516
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:26,917
Hold position here
until we can get our bearing.

517
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:29,834
Full sensor sweep, Mr. Data.
Where are we?

518
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:32,000
Approximately
90 million kilometers

519
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,875
from the star's photosphere.

520
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,458
I am reading a great deal
of surface instability.

521
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,250
It may be...
RAGER: Sir!

522
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,291
The inertial motion
from the tractor beams

523
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,375
is still
carrying us forward.

524
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:44,250
Impulse engines are off-line

525
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:46,625
and I can't stop our momentum.

526
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:49,709
We're falling directly
into the star.

527
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:03,709
The primary computer database
should be online now.

528
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,041
Give it a try.
Okay.

529
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:12,417
I've got three access lines
to the central core.

530
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,458
Still nothing.

531
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,250
Bunch of old,
useless garbage.
Huh?

532
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:20,250
I say it's old,
Mr. La Forge.

533
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:23,250
It can't handle the interface
of your power converter.

534
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:27,542
This equipment was designed
for a different era.

535
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,000
(<i> sighs</i> )

536
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:31,333
Now it's just
a piece of junk.

537
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:32,750
Well, I don't know,
it seems like

538
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:34,583
some of it's
held together pretty well.

539
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,208
Century out of date.

540
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,959
It's just... obsolete.

541
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,625
Well, you know,
that's interesting because...

542
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:44,667
I was just thinking
that a lot of these systems

543
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:48,750
haven't changed much
in the last 75 years.

544
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:51,792
This transporter is
basically the same system

545
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:53,583
we use on
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

546
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,792
Subspace radio
and sensors

547
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,333
still operate under
the same basic principle.

548
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,500
Impulse engine design
hasn't changed much in
the last 200 years.

549
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,125
If it wasn't for all
the structural damage,

550
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:05,250
this ship still might be
in service today.

551
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:09,125
Maybe so...

552
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:12,792
But when they can build ships
like your<i> Enterprise,</i>

553
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:15,625
who'd want to pilot
an old bucket like this?

554
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,291
I don't know.

555
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,500
If this ship were operational,
I'd bet she'd run circles

556
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:21,625
around the<i> Enterprise</i> 
at impulse speeds.

557
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:25,000
Just because something's old,
doesn't mean you throw it away.

558
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:30,750
You know, we used to have
something called a dynamic
mode converter.

559
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:33,792
You wouldn't have something
like that on your<i> Enterprise,</i> 
would you?

560
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:38,291
I haven't seen anything
like that in a long time,

561
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:41,041
but I bet I might be able to
come up with something similar.

562
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,041
La Forge to<i> Enterprise.</i>

563
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,667
La Forge to<i> Enterprise.</i> 
Come in, please.

564
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,041
Interference?

565
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,000
No, they're gone.

566
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:00,542
DATA:
We will enter the sun's
photosphere in three minutes.

567
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,208
PICARD:
Maneuvering thrusters.

568
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,291
I've got 30% power.
It won't be enough to stop us.

569
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,291
No, but it may be enough
to turn us into orbit

570
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:10,208
and hold our distance
from the photosphere.

571
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,166
Ensign, port thrusters
ahead full.

572
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:14,375
Starboard thrusters,
back full.

573
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,083
DATA:
Our flight path is changing.

574
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,375
Right 10.7 degrees, sir--

575
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:21,208
insufficient to clear
the photosphere.

576
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,959
RIKER:
Lieutenant Bartel,

577
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,333
divert all power from
the auxiliary relay systems

578
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,834
to the maneuvering thrusters.
BARTEL: Aye, sir.

579
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,709
RAGER:
We're in orbit, Captain.

580
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,125
Our altitude
is 150,000 kilometers.

581
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,208
I'll see about getting
main power back online.

582
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,208
Very well.

583
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,291
Mr. Data, begin a scan

584
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:49,000
of the interior surface
for life-forms.

585
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:51,792
I want to know
who brought us in here...

586
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:52,792
and why.

587
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:54,125
Aye, sir.

588
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,583
Can't find them
anywhere in orbit.

589
00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:00,542
Well, they could have
crashed into the sphere
like the<i> Jenolan.</i>

590
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,750
No, we'd be picking up
background radiation

591
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:03,917
if they'd gone down.

592
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:06,208
There's another
possibility.

593
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,291
They could be
inside the sphere.

594
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,709
Maybe.

595
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,208
Whatever happened,
we've got to find them.

596
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,375
You know, if we could get
these engines back online,

597
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:17,875
we could track them with
their impulse ion trail.

598
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:19,458
Are you daft?!

599
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,792
The main drive
assembly is shot,

600
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,375
the inducers
have melted,

601
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,583
the power couplings
are wrecked.

602
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,834
We'd need a week
just to get started,

603
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,542
but we don't
have a week,

604
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:32,000
so we've no sense
in crying about it.

605
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:35,125
Come on, we'll see what we can
do with your power converter.

606
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:39,542
The sphere appears
to be abandoned, Captain.

607
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,667
Sensors show that the star
is extremely unstable.

608
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:44,333
It is experiencing
severe bursts

609
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:46,834
of radiation
and matter expulsions.

610
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:49,542
Then that would explain
why they abandoned it,

611
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,834
but if there's no one
still living there,

612
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,542
how were
we brought inside?

613
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,250
I believe we have
triggered a series

614
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,750
of automatic piloting beams

615
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:59,250
designed to guide ships
into the sphere.

616
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:01,208
Sir, sensors show a large

617
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,542
magnetic disturbance
on the star's surface.

618
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,333
It is a solar flare,
Captain.

619
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:08,542
Magnitude: 12.
Class: B.

620
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,250
Shields?

621
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:15,667
Shields are up,
but only at 23%.

622
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:18,709
The star has entered
a period of increased activity.

623
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,125
Sensors indicate that the solar
flares will continue to grow.

624
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:24,709
In three hours,
our shields will no longer

625
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,750
be sufficient
to protect us, sir.

626
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,709
SCOTTY: Shunt the deuterium
from the main cryo-pump

627
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,542
to the auxiliary tank.

628
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,166
LA FORGE: The tank can't
withstand that kind of pressure.

629
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,125
(<i> Scotty laughs</i> )

630
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,750
Where'd you...
where'd you get that idea?

631
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:52,333
What do you mean,
where did I get that idea?

632
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:55,875
It's in the impulse engine
specifications.

633
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:58,583
Regulation 42/15--

634
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:02,291
"pressure variances
on the IRC tank storage"?
Yeah.

635
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,959
Forget it.
I wrote it.

636
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,166
A good engineer

637
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:10,166
is always a wee bit
conservative, at least on paper.

638
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,583
Just bypass the secondary
cutoff valve and boost the flow.

639
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:14,792
It'll work.

640
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:16,959
Okay.

641
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,667
If we've done
our jobs properly,

642
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:24,959
the engines should be
coming back online

643
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,333
about... now.

644
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,500
(<i> engines powering up</i> )

645
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,583
Hey, you were right.

646
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:36,917
The auxiliary tank
is holding.

647
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:39,125
Take the Bridge,
Commander.

648
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,458
Oh, no.

649
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,458
You're the senior
officer here.

650
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,709
Oh, I may be captain by rank,

651
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,667
but I never wanted to be

652
00:35:47,709 --> 00:35:50,625
anything else
but an engineer.

653
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,041
All right.

654
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,333
WORF:
Shields still holding, sir,

655
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:07,750
but they are down
another 15%.

656
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:10,542
Mr. Worf, can we use the phasers
to open a hole in the sphere?

657
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:14,041
No, sir, the exterior shell is
composed of carbon-neutronium.

658
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,041
Our weapons would
be ineffective.

659
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:19,291
Mr. Data, we have to find
some way out of here.

660
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:22,291
Begin scanning for
another hatch or portal

661
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,542
that might
still be open.

662
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,000
The interior surface area

663
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,709
is over ten to
the 16th square kilometers.

664
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,583
It will take seven hours
to completely scan
the surface, sir.

665
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:34,041
(<i> thunderous rumbling</i> )

666
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:37,166
I will endeavor
to speed up the process, sir.

667
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:47,250
The<i> Enterprise's</i> ion trail
leads right to this point.

668
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:50,000
LA FORGE: It looks like
some kind of doorway.

669
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,166
I bet you two
bottles of scotch

670
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:55,208
that they're
inside the sphere,

671
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,709
and that they went in

672
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,208
right through that hatch.

673
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,792
No bet here.

674
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:04,500
The question... is how?

675
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:07,750
Look at the momentum
distribution of the ions.

676
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,166
It would take
an impulse engine

677
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:14,041
full reverse to put out
a signature like that.

678
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,166
So they didn't
go in willingly.

679
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:22,625
This looks like some kind
of communications array.
Aye.

680
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:26,166
We found hundreds of them
when we did our initial
survey 75 years ago.

681
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:29,291
Did you try hailing them?
Aye, that was standard
procedure at the time.

682
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:33,417
And we did it
right before we crashed.
Yeah.

683
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:36,083
Hailing is standard
procedure today, too.

684
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:39,583
Scotty...

685
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,583
what if...

686
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,959
those aren't
communications arrays?

687
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,417
What if they're
access terminals

688
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:49,792
which are triggered by

689
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,583
subspace signals
on certain frequencies?

690
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:55,333
Frequencies like our
standard ship's hail.

691
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:56,792
Exactly.

692
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:58,583
The<i> Enterprise,</i> when
they saw that terminal,

693
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,500
they probably did
the same thing you did

694
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:02,667
75 years ago--
open a channel--

695
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:04,375
only this time,
they triggered something

696
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,917
that activated
that hatch

697
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:08,083
and pulled the ship
inside the sphere.

698
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:10,667
A very nice piece
of reasoning, laddie.

699
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,250
Nice, indeed.
Yeah.

700
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,166
Well, we could probably
trigger the hatch ourselves,

701
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,250
only we'd get pulled in
just like they were.

702
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:20,834
Maybe all we need to do is
to get our foot in the door.

703
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,667
Now, we might not
be pulled inside

704
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:28,375
when the hatch opens...

705
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:32,417
if we keep our distance
from the sphere,

706
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,208
say, uh...

707
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,583
half-a-million kilometers.

708
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,166
Then, when the hatch
starts to close,

709
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:41,792
we move in,
and we use the<i> Jenolan</i>

710
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,542
to jam the hatch open,

711
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:45,750
hoping that the<i> Enterprise</i> 
will escape.

712
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:48,000
You can't be serious.

713
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,083
That hatch is huge.

714
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,959
It'll crush this ship
like an egg.

715
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,250
Geordi, the shields will hold,
don't worry about that.

716
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,125
And I can get a few extra
gigawatts out of these babies.

717
00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,917
Oh, Scotty, it's crazy.

718
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:03,875
Geordi, I have spent
my whole life

719
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:08,291
trying to figure out
crazy ways of doing things.

720
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:12,583
I'm telling you,
as one engineer to another,

721
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,667
I can do this.

722
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:17,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

723
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,709
All right.
Let's do it.
Aye.

724
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:28,500
We're at
500,000 kilometers.

725
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,375
Engines are ready.

726
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:32,041
Okay.

727
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,125
Here we go.

728
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:42,417
Come on.

729
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,583
There's nothing out here.

730
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,166
Give it up.

731
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:53,625
That's it.
Let's go.

732
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:55,417
Full impulse.

733
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:06,709
(<i> console beeping</i> )

734
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,250
Sir, there is an audio message
from Commander La Forge.

735
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:12,375
La Forge to<i> Enterprise.</i> 
Do you read me?

736
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:14,166
Go ahead, Commander,
we read you.

737
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:16,291
We're using the<i> Jenolan</i> 
to hold open the hatch

738
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,208
that you came through,
but our shields

739
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,750
aren't going to
hold out much longer.

740
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,500
Understood.
Ensign, set a course.

741
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,834
The plasma
intercooler is gone.

742
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,875
The engines
are overheating.

743
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,208
I've lost helm control.

744
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,166
La Forge to<i> Enterprise.</i>

745
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,125
Captain, we're not going
to be able to move this ship

746
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,792
out of the way
when you get here.

747
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:51,750
You're going to have to destroy
it in order to escape.

748
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:53,458
How much longer
before we reach them?

749
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,625
With impulse engines
operating at 60% power,

750
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:59,208
it will take one minute,
forty seconds.

751
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,625
Bridge to
Transporter Room three.

752
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,583
Prepare to beam two

753

754

It's coming apart, lad.

755
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:16,458
I can't do
anything else.

756
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:21,458
Photon torpedoes
armed and ready, sir.

757
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,917
We are within
transporter range.

758
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:28,291
Bridge to Transporter Room.
Energize.

00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:29,542
CREWMAN:
Aye, sir.

760
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,750
Fire torpedoes.

761

<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46125.3:</i>

764
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:07,667
<i>Starfleet has dispatched</i>

<i>while we proceed</i>
<i>to Starbase 55.</i>

767
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:15,000
So this alien space baby--

768
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:16,917
which was about the size
of a four-story building--

769
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,750
really thought the<i> Enterprise</i> 
was its mother.

770
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:21,959
Oh, you're pulling
an old man's leg.
No, really.

771
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,709
It was suckling power directly
from the ship's fusion reactors,

772
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,458
so Dr. Brahms and I
changed the power frequency

773
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,417
from 21 centimeters
to .02 centimeters.

774
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:36,625
So you soured
the milk!
That's right.

775
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:40,041
Oh, enjoy these
times, Geordi.

776
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:43,792
You're the Chief
Engineer of a starship

777
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:47,291
and it's a time of your life
that'll never come again.

778
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:49,291
When it's gone,

779
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,166
it's gone.

780
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:54,542
Now, lad, I thought
you were going to buy me
a drink in Ten Forward.

781
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:56,834
Actually,
I had a better idea.

782
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:10,250
You're giving me
one of your shuttles?

783
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,959
Well, call it
an extended loan.

784
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,667
Since you lost your ship saving
ours, it seemed only fair.

785
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:18,250
She's not much
to look at.

786
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:21,875
Laddie, every woman
has her own charm.

787
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:24,000
You just have to know
where to look for it.

788
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:27,208
Well, she's a little slow,
but she'll certainly get you
to the Norpin colony,

789
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,333
if that's<i> really</i> 
where you want to go.

790
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:34,125
The Norpin colony is
for old men to retire.

791
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:37,000
Maybe someday
I'll end up there,

792
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,291

And a fine ship,
a credit to her name,

801
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:04,792
but I've always found
that a ship is only as good

802
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:07,000
as the engineer
who takes care of her.
