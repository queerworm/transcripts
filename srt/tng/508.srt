00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:19,291
Three weeks ago, one of our
most celebrated ambassadors,

3
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:23,458
an advisor to Federation leaders
for generations, disappeared.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,375
I gave Spock the benefit

5
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:29,375
of experience, of logic.

6
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,375
He never listened.

7
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:35,208
It's been suggested
that he might have defected.

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,125
Why would anyone want
a Vulcan shield array?

9
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,709
Beats me, Commander.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,125
Every question we answer here
seems to brings up two more.

11
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,208
Be careful, android.

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,667
Some Romulan beauty
might take a liking to you--

13
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,709
lick that paint
right off your ears.

14
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,792
You, do you know what
the Romulans will do to you

15
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:00,792
if they discover
who you are?

16
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:02,667
I have a good idea.

17
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,000
Sir, the ship
is locking phasers.

18
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,458
Shields up.
Red alert.

19
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:20,875
What do you know of this human--

20
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:23,709
Jean-Luc Picard,
a Starfleet Captain?

21
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,834
You've made a mistake.

22
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,417
Quiet. Come with us.

23
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:31,667
I have come on an urgent mission
from the Federation.

24
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,709
I'm looking
for Ambassador Spock.

25
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,458
You have found him,
Captain Picard.

26
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,834
WOMAN:
<i>And now the conclusion.</i>

27
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,750
SPOCK:
What are you
doing on Romulus?

28
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,083
That was to have been
my question of you, sir.

29
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,500
It is no concern
of Starfleet.

30
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:56,375
On the contrary, it is very much
Starfleet's concern.

31
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,834
You are in a position

32
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,750
to compromise
the security of the Federation.

33
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,750
You may assure your
superiors, Captain,

34
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:04,333
that I am here on a
personal mission of peace.

35
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,875
And I will advise Starfleet
when it is appropriate.

36
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,875
That is not satisfactory.

37
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,125
You cannot remain here,
Captain Picard.

38
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,083
And I will not return

39
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,166
without a full explanation.

40
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,458
Ambassador,
with great respect

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,750
for all that you've achieved

42
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:24,083
on behalf of
the Federation,

43
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,166
this sort of cowboy diplomacy

44
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,333
will not easily
be tolerated anymore.

45
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,083
"Cowboy diplomacy"?

46
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,875
If you wish
to undertake a mission

47
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:37,208
with obvious repercussions
for the Federation

48
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,417
then you should discuss it
with the Federation.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,417
I'm here
as their representative.

50
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,166
You'll have to discuss
it with me.

51
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,083
That is precisely what
I had hoped to avoid.

52
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,250
I also have
the responsibility

53
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,709
of being the bearer
of unhappy news.

54
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,542
Sarek?

55
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,542
Sarek is dead.

56
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,333
Walk with me, Picard.

57
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:42,083
I know of your mind meld
with my father

58
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,875
which enabled him
to complete his last mission.

59
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:46,291
It was an honor.

60
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,750
He's a great man.

61
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,583
He was a great representative
of the Vulcan people

62
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,041
and of the Federation.

63
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,000
I was with him
before coming here.

64
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,667
He expressed
his pride in you--

65
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,208
his love.

66
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,709
Emotional disarray
was a symptom

67
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,875
of the illness
from which he suffered.

68
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:08,291
No, those feelings
came from his heart.

69
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,291
He shared them with me.

70
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,041
I know.

71
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,250
Sarek would no more approve
my coming here

72
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:19,041
than you do, Picard.

73
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,750
For some time now

74
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,458
I've been aware of a growing
movement here of people

75
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,417
who seek to learn the ideals
of the Vulcan philosophy.

76
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,250
They have been declared
enemies of the state

77
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,834
but there are a few
in the Romulan hierarchy

78
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,709
like Pardek,
who are sympathetic.

79
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,333
He asked me to come now

80
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,667
because he believes it may be
time to take the first step

81
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,125
toward reunification.

82
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,291
Reunification?

83
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,792
After so many centuries?

84
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:46,166
After so many
fundamental differences

85
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,709
have evolved
between your peoples?

86
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,667
It would seem
unlikely to succeed

87
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:52,083
but I cannot ignore
the potential rewards

88
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,542
that a union between
our two worlds would bring.

89
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,041
What is this first step
that Pardek suggests?

90
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,709
There is a new proconsul
in the Romulan senate.

91
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,125
He is young and idealistic.

92
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,500
He has promised many reforms.

93
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:08,709
Pardek believes
that he may be receptive

94
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,333
to discussing reunification.

95
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,959
Why would you not bring
something so important

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,875
to the attention
of your own people

97
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,834
or the Federation?

98
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,583
A personal decision, Captain.

99
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,208
Perhaps you're aware
of the small role I played

100
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,000
in the overture to peace
with the Klingons.

101
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,208
History is aware

102
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,542
of the role you
played, Ambassador.

103
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,959
Not entirely.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It was I
who committed Captain Kirk

105
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,333
to that peace mission

106
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,542
and I who had
to bear the responsibility

107
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,875
for the consequences
to him and to his crew.

108
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:43,333
Quite simply, I am unwilling to
risk anyone's life but my own

109
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,542
on this occasion

110
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,750
so I ask that you
respect my wishes

111
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:48,750
and leave.

112
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,875

your logic escapes me.

182
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:50,041
It has become a serious concern
for the Romulan leadership.

183
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,875
Serious enough for the leaders

184
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:55,208
to suddenly embrace
a Vulcan peace initiative?

185
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,125
I...

186
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,917
I have...

187
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,291
I have some difficulty
in accepting that.

188
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,500
I sense you have
a closed mind, Captain.

189
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,583
Closed minds have kept these
two worlds apart for centuries.

190
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,333
In the Federation

191
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,959
we have learned from experience
to view the Romulans

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,333
with distrust.

193
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,083
We can either choose to live
with that enmity

194
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,083
or seek a way to change it.

195
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,875
I choose the latter.

196
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,583
I will be the first to cheer

197
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,625
when the Neutral Zone
is abolished

198
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,709
but I wonder if this movement
is strong enough

199
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,542
to reshape the entire Romulan
political landscape.

200
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,875
One can begin
to reshape the landscape

201
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:41,208
with a single flower, Captain.

202
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,750
<i>Jolan true,</i> Mr. Spock.

203
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,917
Here.

204
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,000
Look what I've brought you.

205
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,333
This is my friend D'tan.

206
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,500
He's very curious
about Vulcan.

207
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,834
Hello, D'tan.

208
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:53,834
Where did you get this?

209
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,250
This is very old.

210
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,083
They read to us from it
at the meetings.

211
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,667
It tells the story
of the Vulcan separation.

212
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:04,041
D'tan.

213
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,041
You should not bring
that out here.

214
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,417
You've been told
many times.

215
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,458
I just wanted
to show it to Mr. Spock.

216
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,834
Off with you.

217
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,208
We'll see you
later tonight.

218
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,458
Will you tell us
more stories about Vulcan?

219
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Yes, I will.

220
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,041
<i>Jolan true.</i>

221
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:30,709
Perhaps this is not
such a good place to talk.

222
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:44,083
So, what do you think
of your enemy, Captain Picard?

223
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,792
PICARD:
These people are
no one's enemy, Senator.

224
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,458
PARDEK:
Many of my colleagues

225
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,250
fear what they have to say,

226
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:55,208
but I have learned
to listen carefully.

227
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,834
Children like D'tan
are our future.

228
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,458
Old men like me
will not be able

229
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,875
to hold on to ancient
prejudice and hostility.

230
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,667
Young people won't allow it

231
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:09,166
but now,

232
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:13,125
now that they've
met their first real Vulcan

233
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,291
it has only inspired
them more.

234
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,667
I am sure that is evident
to you, Spock.

235
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:20,542
I did not anticipate
such a passionate response

236
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,625
to my arrival.

237
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,208
Romulans are
passionate people.

238
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,041
The Vulcans will learn
to appreciate

239
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,750
that quality in us.

240
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,458
If we are successful.

241
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
We will know soon.

242
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,542
The proconsul has agreed
to meet with you.

243
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,417
RIKER:
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>

244
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,291
<i>Stardate 45245.8.</i>

245
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,125
<i>The Enterprise remains</i>
<i>at Qualor Two</i>

246
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,750
<i>as we continue</i>
<i>to investigate the theft</i>

247
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,792
<i>of a surplus Vulcan ship.</i>

248
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,250
<i>The trail has led us</i>

249
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,834
<i>to the former wife</i>
<i>of a deceased smuggler.</i>

250
00:13:57,417 --> 00:14:01,333
(<i> chime music playing</i> )

251
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,208
A new face.

252
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,333
Same one I've always had.

253
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,250
And what would
you like to hear?

254
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,417
Know some blues?

255
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,417
Look at me, mister.

256
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,792
What do you think?

257
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:18,750
Seven different
shades of them.

258
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,583
How about some Andorian blues?

259
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,333
Suck salt?

260
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,125
Never cared for it.

261
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,333
Mmm...

262
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,959
Good for you.

263
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,291
Nasty habit.

264
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,834
So who are you looking for?

265
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,333
Who says I'm looking
for anybody?

266
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,458
Your face, your uniform,
in a place like this.

267
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,333
Okay.
I'm looking for you.

268
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,750
Oh, you just made my day.

269
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:46,750
I have to ask
about your husband.

270
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,750
Well, it was nice
while it lasted.

271
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,417
Which husband?

272
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,959
The dead one, I'm afraid.

273
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh, you must be
from the<i> Enterprise.</i>

274
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,625
You destroyed his ship.

275
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,125
He was into
some bad business.

276
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,375
He took the evidence with him.

277
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,625
His one endearing quality--

278
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:08,500
he always cleaned up
after himself.

279
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,041
And what do you want from me?

280
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,500
I was hoping you might know his
business partners.

281
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:14,417
And why should I help you?

282
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,709
To be honest,
I can't think of a good reason.

283
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,125
Well...

284
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,500
you did kill
my ex-husband.

285
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,959
And that's not a bad start.

286
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,208
So why don't you drop
a few coins in the jar

287
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,417
and I'll see
what I remember.

288
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,750
I don't carry money.

289
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,792
Well you don't offer much,
do you?

290
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,333
Move over.

291
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,375
Oh, just what I need--
another set of hands.

292
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:43,333
Know this one?

293
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,417
(<i> playing blues</i> )

294
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,959
20th century Earth.

295
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,250
Maybe I could teach you
a lick or two.

296
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,750
You already have.

297
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,792
So what do you say?

298
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,000
Going to be around
for a couple of days?

299
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,667
I can be.

300
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:09,625
Sooner or later, a man named
Omag will come by for a song.

301
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,500
Always wants to hear
the same thing--

302
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,875
<i>"Melor Famagal."</i>

303
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,417
He's an arms trader.

304
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,792
A fat Ferengi.

305
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,250
(<i> door chimes</i> )

306
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,625
Enter.

307
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,500
Proconsul.

308
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:32,750
Yes.

309
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,291
Pardek, come in.

310
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,875
Ambassador Spock of Vulcan.

311
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:50,917
Proconsul.

312
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh, please.

313
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,583
I've never liked titles

314
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,417
ever since I was a lowly
uhlan in the Romulan guard.

315
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,000
I am Neral.

316
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,583
How is it again?

317
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,166
Pardek's tried
to show me.

318
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,542
I am honored.

319
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,166
Good.

320
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,625
Permit me to withdraw.

321
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,125
Will we see you and
your wife tomorrow

322
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,083
at the state dinner?

323
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,959
We're looking forward to it.

324
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,583
It's been years
since old Pardek's

325
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,542
been invited
to an official function.

326
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,375
He's far too attached
to the common man

327
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,792
for most people's comfort.

328
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,250
That is their loss.

329
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,375
I've found Pardek
to have

330
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:28,667
a unique insight
into many issues.

331
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,375
Let me tell
you something, Spock.

332
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,208
We are going to start
something here, you and I,

333
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,667
that will redraw the face
of the quadrant.

334
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:41,125
Are you prepared
to support reunification?

335
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,542
I believe
it must eventually come.

336
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,875
Our two worlds need each other.

337
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,792
Forgive me, I...

338
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:54,000
did not expect to hear
a Romulan proconsul

339
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,166
speak like a member
of your underground.

340
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,709
Well, I want you to know
exactly where I stand.

341
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,583
And do you believe

342
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,792
that you can gain the support

343
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,834
of your full senate?

344
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,667
Well, things are not what
they once were in the senate.

345
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:12,750
The old leaders have lost
the respect of the people.

346
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,208
Involvement
in the Klingon war...

347
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,083
endless confrontations
with the Federation...

348
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,875
they're tired of it.

349
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:21,333
Times are changing

350
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,667
and leaders who refuse
to change with them

351
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:26,834
will no longer
be leaders.

352
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,458
Spock, I am prepared
to publicly endorse

353
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,041
the opening of talks
between our peoples.

354
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,291
What do you think
the Vulcan people

355
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,291
will think of that?

356
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,834
They will be cautious.

357
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,291
There are generations
of distrust to overcome.

358
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,458
But surely with a man of your
influence leading the way...

359
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,250
Proconsul, the senate
has been recalled into session.

360
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,000
Very well.

361
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,333
Can we meet
again tomorrow?

362
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,583
As you wish.

363
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,542
Good.

364
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,083
<i>Jolan true,</i> Spock.

365
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh...

366
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,333
Live long and prosper.

367
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,834
It's everything
we could have hoped for.

368
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,041
SPOCK:
It is<i> more</i> than
we could have hoped for.

369
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,500
But if Neral is ready to

370
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,875
publically endorse
reunification...

371
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:38,333
It is hard to believe

372
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,625
that he can rise to the rank
of senate proconsul

373
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:42,667
without the support of the
Romulan traditionalists.

374
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:44,166
That may be true, but...

375
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,208
Then how can he turn
his back on them so easily?

376
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,792
How can he endorse reunification
when it's considered subversive?

377
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,500
Because he's
not afraid of them.

378
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:51,959
He knows that we'll
support it.

379
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,542
Captain Picard is correct.

380
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,959
It is not logical
for the proconsul

381
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,417
to support reunification
at this time.

382
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,583
Why would Neral lie?

383
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,750
Perhaps because he's
hoping to expose

384
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,000
members of your movement.

385
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,333
No, this is our chance
for acceptance--

386
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,709
finally to be heard.

387
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,417
I believe
it's the Federation

388
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,500
that fears an alliance

389
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,500
between Romulus and Vulcan.

390
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,083
That is not true!

391
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,250
I came here to determine
the potential for reunification.

392
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,709
In spite of what has occurred,

393
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,834
I intend to continue
with my efforts.

394
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,750
I intend to meet
with the proconsul as planned.

395
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,083
You let
their emotions sway you.

396
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,709
On the contrary, I am pursuing
the most logical course.

397
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,291
You're as skeptical
as I am.

398
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,917
Is it logical to ignore
your own good sense?

399
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,834
I fear the influence of Sarek

400
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,750
has colored
your attitudes, Captain,

401
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:47,458
toward reunification
and perhaps toward me.

402
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,083
That is the second time

403
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,250
you have accused me of speaking
with another man's voice.

404
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,375
It's true he will
always be a part of me--

405
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:58,041
his experience

406
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,208
his spirit.

407
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,542
But I speak
with my own voice, not his.

408
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,625
Curious...

409
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,417
that I should hear him
so clearly

410
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,208
now that he is dead.

411
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:13,291
It is possible
that I have brought

412
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,959
my argument with Sarek
to you, Captain.

413
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
If so, I apologize.

414
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,333
Is it so important

415
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,333
that you win one last
argument with him?

416
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,667
No, it is not,

417
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,792
but it is true that
I will miss the arguments.

418
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:26,291
They were, finally,
all that we had.

419
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,291
But your fight with Sarek
is over, Spock.

420
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,417
You have none with me.

421
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,208
I always had
a different vision

422
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,667
than my father--

423
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:38,458
the ability to see
beyond pure logic.

424
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,250
He considered it weak.

425
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,875
But I have discovered it

426
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:45,041
to be a source
of extraordinary strength.

427
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,834
Sarek would have seen

428
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,208
this mission of reunification

429
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,000
as a fool's errand.

430
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,083
Somehow, I think it is not.

431
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,709
Logic cannot explain why.

432
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,125
I only know that
I must pursue this.

433
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,291
Even if it leads you
into a Romulan trap?

434
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,583
If the Romulans
do have an ulterior motive

435
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,792
it is in the best interests
of all concerned

436
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:07,542
that we determine what it is

437
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:11,250
so I will play the role
that they would have me play.

438
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,583
Have you had
any success, Mr. Data?

439
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:29,583
Negative, Captain.

440
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,500
The Romulan information net

441
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,500
employs a progressive
encryption lock.

442
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:36,583
I've been unable to penetrate
their security measures.

443
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,333
May I assist you,
Commander?

444
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,625
I have had some experience
in these matters.

445
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,291
By all means, Ambassador.

446
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,375
The Romulans have incorporated
a 43-part cipher key

447
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:49,500
into their
entry sequence.

448
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:50,709
Yes, sir.

449
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,458
The 29th is the only one
I cannot bypass.

450
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,625
I think I'll take this
opportunity to remove my ears.

451
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,166
He intrigues me--

452
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,625
this Picard.

453
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:10,917
In what manner, sir?

454
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:14,959
He's remarkably analytical
and dispassionate

455
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,458
for a human.

456
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,583
I understand why my father
chose to mind meld with him.

457
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:24,625
There's an almost
Vulcan quality to the man.

458
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,000
Interesting.

459
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,166
I had not considered that

460
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,041
and Captain Picard
has been a role model

461
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,750
in my quest to be more human.

462
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:34,291
More human?

463
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,917
Yes, Ambassador.

464
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,375
Fascinating.

465
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,917
You have an efficient intellect,
superior physical skills

466
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:45,166
no emotional impediments.

467
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,125
There are Vulcans
who aspire all their lives

468
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:50,041
to achieve what you've been
given by design.

469
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,542
You are half-human.

470
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,917
Yes.

471
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:00,500
Yet you've chosen
a Vulcan way of life.

472
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,000
I have.

473
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:06,750
In effect, you've abandoned

474
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:09,166
what I have sought
all my life.

475
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,083
I believe I have isolated

476
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:17,709
the 29th cipher access code.

477
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,750
I shall attempt to access
the proconsul's files.

478
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,250
Ambassador Spock,
may I ask a personal question?

479
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,250
Please.

480
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,083
As you examine your life

481
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:40,375
do you find you have
missed your humanity?

482
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:41,709
I have no regrets.

483
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,917
"No regrets."

484
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,333
That is a human expression.

485
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,542
Yes.

486
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,166
Fascinating.

487
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,625
Do you know any Klingon opera?

488
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:09,375
I don't get a lot
of requests for it.

489
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,041
Surely you must know
at least one theme

490
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:17,041
from<i> Aktuh and Maylota.</i>

491
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,417

It sounds like
a Bardakian pronghorn moose!

502
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,750
You know
what I want to hear.

503
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:00,000
AMARIE:
Yes, yes, I know.

504
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:02,542
( playing music )

505
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:08,333
(<i> Amari singing</i>
<i>soprano trills</i> )

506

Worf to Enterprise.

RIKER:
Go ahead.

508
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,458
A fat Ferengi has just entered

509
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,875
the establishment.

510
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:19,250
Is that<i> "Melor Famagal"</i>
<i>I hear?</i>

511
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,250
It is.

512
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,625
I'm on my way.

513
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,083
Where's the waiter?!

514
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,875
Is there no waiter
in this sorry place?

515
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,542
Is there a problem?

516
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,583
Yes. I need more napkins.

517
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,625
Use your sleeve.

518
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:35,250
What did you say?

519
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,166
Use one of their sleeves.
I don't care.

520
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,792
Who are you?

521
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:41,125
Commander William Riker,
USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

522
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,875
Oh. Am I supposed to
stand up and salute?

523
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:48,959
We're investigating

524
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,959
the disappearance
of a Vulcan ship.

525
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,542
Well, you've got
the wrong Ferengi.

526
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,000
I never traded Vulcan ships.

527
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:57,667
We know that you're involved.

528
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,750
Who would want a Vulcan ship?

529
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,125
Vulcans are pacifists.

530
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,041
I deal in warships.

531
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,333
Can somebody get me a napkin?!

532
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,542
Who<i> would</i> want a Vulcan ship?

533
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,083
Hypothetically speaking?

534
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:11,792
Hypothetically speaking.

535
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:15,375
I never learned
to speak hypothetical.

536
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,959
Ah!

537
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,792
Are you crazy?

538
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,917
Let me explain
what will happen to you

539
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,750
if you don't tell me
about the Vulcan ship.

540
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:30,625
Your right of passage
through this sector

541
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:34,250
will be revoked, and more than
that I will be very unhappy.

542
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,709
I delivered it
to a Barolian freighter.

543
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,875
At what coordinates?

544
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:38,875
I don't remember.

545
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:40,250
Ow! Watch it!

546
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,625
You're stretching my neck!

547
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:42,834
Coordinates?

548
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,750
At Galorndon Core,
near the Neutral Zone.

549
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,875
That's all I know.

550
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,375
I swear it.

551
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,125
Enjoy your dinner.

552
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,583
As soon as I heard
this Barolian ship

553
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,917
was at the Galorndon Core,
I started to think Romulans.

554
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,250
And the Romulans
are suddenly interested

555
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:18,125
in bonding with the Vulcans.

556
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:21,000
Spock has been meeting
with the new senate proconsul

557
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:23,667
about reunification.

558
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:25,417
Reunification?

559
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,333
The proconsul says
that he is prepared

560
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:28,959
to endorse peace talks.

561
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,250
And Spock?

562
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:32,834
The Ambassador
is skeptical

563
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,959
but he cares a great deal
about reunification.

564
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,041
As long as there's
a chance of success,

565
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,041
he's prepared
to pursue it.

566
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,166
I'm afraid I don't see how
a stolen Vulcan ship

567
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:42,500
fits into all of this.

568
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:44,041
Neither do I, counselor.

569
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,583
How soon can you be at
Galorndon Core, Number One?

570
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:47,875
A little over eight hours.

571
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:49,750
Well, this may prove
to be a wild goose chase

572
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,583
but I don't see that we
have any choice, do you?

573
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,959
Agreed.

574
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,417
(<i> console beeping</i> )

575
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:58,458
We are losing our Romulan
carrier wave, sir.

576
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,959
We'll advise you further

577
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,417
as soon as you reach your
destination, Number One.

578
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:02,583
Picard out.

579
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,834
Ensign, set a course
for Galorndon Core.

580
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:06,834
Take us to warp eight.

581
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,166
Aye, sir.

582
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,291
Captain,
the Romulan subspace logs

583
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,458
identify a transmission
from the Romulan surface

584
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,208
to a Barolian ship near
Galorndon Core 12 hours ago.

585
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,125
Galorndon Core<i> is</i> along
the Barolian trade route.

586
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:30,333
They trade a great deal
with the Romulans.

587
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,917
It's probably just routine.

588
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:35,041
This does not appear
to be routine.

589
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,291
I was able to trace
the source of the transmission.

590
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:42,125
It incorporates the code prefix
of Romulan intelligence.

591
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,792
Can you access it?

592
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:48,875
It is a short
sequence of numbers.

593
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,875
One-four-zero-zero.

594
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:52,208
Nothing more?

595
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,542
No, sir.

596
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,750
Spock, I've been
looking for you.

597
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:03,083
I've been meeting
with the proconsul.

598
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:05,375
Does he still speak
of reunification?

599
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:07,250
He speaks of nothing else.

600
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,834
Have you ever seen these?

601
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:20,041
The syllabic nucleus
of the Vulcan language.

602
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,417
They were my toys
when I was small.

603
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,667
Your parents wanted you
to learn to understand Vulcan?

604
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:25,834
Yes.

605
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:28,208
As did their parents
before them.

606
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,875
To prepare us for the day
when we would live again

607
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:31,500
with our Vulcan cousins.

608
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,375
Your friends from the Federation
have returned.

609
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,041
They need
to see you immediately.

610
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,000
I've told Pardek.

611
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,709
He'll meet you in the cave.

612
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:48,792
The only communication
that was sent

613
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:51,709
were the numbers
one-four-zero-zero.

614
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,333
What does
it mean?

615
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,583
It means
that the proconsul

616
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:58,166
has apparently been
attempting to deceive me.

617
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:59,917
For what purpose,
I cannot say yet

618
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,333
but his conversations with me
have obviously been part

619
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:05,500
of a greater plan which involves
the stolen Vulcan ship.

620
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:07,250
How do you know that,
Ambassador?

621
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:10,709
The time the proconsul set
for the subspace announcement

622
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,166
of our peace initiative
is 1400 hours tomorrow.

623
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,792
One-four-zero-zero.

624
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:18,542
Why would they
need a Vulcan ship?

625
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:22,625
SELA:
That will become clear
very shortly.

626
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:28,083
Captain Picard,
welcome to Romulus.

627
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:31,417
I trust
you've enjoyed your visit

628
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:35,041
and this is the android
I've come to respect in battle.

629
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,583
Lieutenant Commander Data.

630
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:37,917
How could they know

631
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:38,917
of this location?

632
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:40,041
Someone has betrayed us.

633
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,458
Yes, you did.

634
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,917
Spock...

635
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:49,000
we've been friends for 80 years.

636
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,041
It is the only
logical conclusion.

637
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,959
You asked me to come to Romulus

638
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,375
you arranged the meetings
with the proconsul

639
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:57,125
and you knew that
Picard and Data

640
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:00,709
had returned to the surface
with new information.

641
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,834
The great Spock.

642
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,667
Very well.

643
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:09,041
Senator Pardek, your service to
the Romulan people

644
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,625
is noted and appreciated.

645
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:16,375
<i>Jolan true,</i> Spock.

646
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:23,291
Do not be distressed.

647
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:26,291
Your dream of reunification
is not dead.

648
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,375
It will simply take
a different form--

649
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:32,083
the Romulan conquest of Vulcan.

650
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,500
Bring them.

651
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:51,166
<i>First officer's log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

652
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,709
<i>The</i> Enterprise
<i>has reached Galorndon Core</i>

653
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,834
<i>near the border</i>
<i>of the Neutral Zone.</i>

654
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,458
Any signs of life,
Mr. La Forge?

655
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,291
Negative, Commander.

656
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,750
The Romulans could have
a cloaked base on the surface.

657
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:03,458
Or anywhere else
along the Neutral Zone.

658
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,041
Sir, a coded subspace
signal from Romulus.

659
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,542
It's the Captain.

660
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,458
What?

661
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,250
"Maintain position
at Galorndon Core.

662
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:17,875
"Diplomatic initiative
appears to be succeeding.

663
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:19,458
Will advise."

664
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,333
The message did employ
the proper coded sequence.

665
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,291
Yeah, I'm sure
it did.

666
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,542
SELA:
Come in, gentlemen.

667
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,083
Take a seat, please.

668
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:45,917
Excuse me, I'm just
finishing up a speech...

669
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,834
for you, Mr. Spock.

670
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,208
I rather enjoy writing.

671
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,083
I don't get to do it
very often in this job.

672
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,792
Perhaps you would be
happier in another job.

673
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,750
Please feel free to change
any words that you wish.

674
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:01,750
I've tried to make it
sound Vulcan--

675
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:04,625
a lot of unnecessarily
long words.

676
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,041
In a few hours,
you will deliver

677
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,166
this statement alongside
our senate proconsul.

678
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,542
It will announce to the Vulcans
that a peace envoy

679
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,625
is on its way from Romulus.

680
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:14,250
We will transmit it
on all Federation

681
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,291
subspace frequencies.

682
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,041
A peace envoy
in a stolen Vulcan ship?

683
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,417
Actually, three Vulcan ships,
Captain.

684
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:22,709
The<i> Enterprise</i> is only aware

685
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,709
of the one we stole
from Qualor Two.

686
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,750
We have been following
their investigation.

687
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:29,125
It has forced us
to make some minor changes--

688
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,709
one of them, a message
sent in your name

689
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,875
ordering them
to stay where they are.

690
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:36,208
The moment those Vulcan ships
enter the Neutral Zone

691
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,083
the<i> Enterprise</i>
will move to intercept.

692
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:39,667
In that event, the<i> Enterprise</i>

693
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:41,458
will be given more important
matters to attend to.

694
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,792
In the meantime,

695
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:44,458
Ambassador Spock
will be telling his people

696
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,250
to welcome the peace envoy.

697
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:49,041
And when they do,
our forces will seize control

698
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,333
before anyone realizes
what has happened.

699
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,792
Do you seriously believe

700
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:55,583
that the Federation
will not immediately intervene?

701
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:58,375
Of course it will, and we're
fully prepared for it.

702
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:00,709
But we will be there--
entrenched.

703
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,500
And it will be very difficult
to get us out once we are.

704
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:07,792
Reunification will become
a fact of life.

705
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:11,125
I will not read this
or any other statement.

706
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:13,417
If you do not,
you will die.

707
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:14,792
All of you will die.

708
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,792
Since it is logical
to conclude

709
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:19,834
that you will kill us
in any event

710
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:21,834
I choose not to cooperate.

711
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,500
I hate Vulcans.

712
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:26,625
I hate the logic.

713
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:27,709
I hate the arrogance.

714
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,083
Very well.

715
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:36,041
Computer, holographic
program Spock one.

716
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,041
By taking advantage
of holographic sampling

717
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,291
during the last few days

718
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:42,750
we have created
a programmable Spock.

719
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:44,083
Run program.

720
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,500
This is Ambassador
Spock of Vulcan.

721
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:51,375
By now,
Federation sensors

722
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:53,917
are tracking
three Vulcan ships

723
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:56,083
crossing the Neutral Zone.

724
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,250
These ships
carry the future

725
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:01,375
of the Romulan
and the Vulcan people.

726
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:04,000
Our long conflict
is finally over.

727
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:05,333
SELA:
Freeze.

728
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,250
We would have preferred
an interactive Spock

729
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,291
who could have
responded to questions

730
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:12,834
but this will have to suffice.

731
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,375
You can hardly believe
this will convince anyone.

732
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:18,333
I don't need to convince them--
just confuse them long enough

733
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,583
to reach Vulcan.

734
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,959
End program.

735
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,375
If you'll excuse me,

736
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,417
it's time to send our ships
on their journey.

737
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:35,125
Suggestions.

738
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:38,083
Commander Data,
are they still unaware

739
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,875
that we have access
to their computers?

740
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:41,166
I believe so, Ambassador.

741
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:42,792
Then perhaps
you and I can find a way

742
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,333
to create a diversion.

743
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,750
Sir, sensors are picking up

744
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:54,959
three vessels
crossing the Neutral Zone.

745
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,291
Vulcan ships.

746
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,792
Vulcan?

747
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,583
What's the heading,
Mr. Worf?

748
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:06,500
143.012.

749
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:09,917
That would put them
on a course to Vulcan.

750
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,208
They don't seem to be
in any hurry.

751
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,500
They're only moving at
warp one, Commander.

752
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,792
Worf, signal them
on subspace.

753
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,375
Request their status.

754
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:18,542
Geordi, see if you can tell if
it's one of the ships

755
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:19,917
that we've
been looking for.

756
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,166
They say they
are escorting

757
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,667
a peace envoy
from Romulus to Vulcan.

758
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:28,583
They request we monitor
Federation subspace channels.

759
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:31,375
Ambassador Spock will be making
an announcement shortly.

760
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,375
Perhaps his reunification talks
were successful.

761
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,917
Geordi?

762
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:36,208
None of
the transponder signatures

763
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,041
matches that
of the missing ship.

764
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,166
They could
have been altered.

765
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,125
I'll keep checking.

766
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,583
Set a course to intercept.

767
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:46,208
Sir, the Captain's orders
were to maintain...

768
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,834
I know the Captain's
orders, Lieutenant.

769
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:51,208
Engage.

770
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,834
Impossible.

771
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,750
There's no way they could have
gotten out of this room.

772
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:09,458
RIKER:
That's far enough.

773
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,083
Stay right where you are.

774
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,125
Drop your weapons.

775
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,250
How did you get in here?

776
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,583
Drop your weapons.

777
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:19,208
Drop your weapons.

778
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,583
Cease fire.

779
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,125
Holograms.

780
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,083
I'm afraid
I don't know too much

781
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:36,041
about Romulan
disrupter settings.

782
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:43,250
Cowboy diplomacy?

783
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,250
Well done, Mr. Data.

784
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:53,375
Though...

785
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:54,792
I don't think you got
Commander Riker's hair

786
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:55,917
quite right.

787
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,542
I will be more observant
in the future, sir.

788
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,208
It doesn't matter
what you do now

789
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,709
Spock's announcement
will be made in minutes.

790
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,041
Our forces will be on Vulcan
before you can alert anyone.

791
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,458
We've just received
a priority one distress call

792
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,291
from the colony
on Dulisian Four.

793
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:21,458
A massive failure

794
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,875
of the environmental
support systems.

795
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,500
They're going
to require evacuation.

796
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:28,917
Mr. Worf,
any other ships

797
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,750
in the vicinity
of Dulisian Four?

798
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,083
One, sir, a Rutian
archaeological vessel.

799
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,417
I'm sure
it's not equipped

800
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,125
to handle something
of this scale, Will.

801
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,625
Geordi, any update
on the Vulcan ships?

802
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:41,792
I've checked every sensor
display backwards and forwards.

803
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,000
If the Romulans
altered them

804
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,458
they didn't
leave fingerprints.

805
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,291
I can't tie any of them
to the surplus yard.

806
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,375
The Vulcan ships
have entered Federation space,

807
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:49,667
maintaining low warp.

808
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:52,542
Lay in a new course
to Dulisian Four.

809
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:53,959
WORF:
Incoming message
from Romulus

810
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,709
on all subspace channels.

811
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,291
On screen.

812
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:03,125
This is Ambassador Spock
of Vulcan.

813
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,375
By now, Federation sensors

814
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:07,000
are tracking
three Vulcan ships

815
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,709
crossing the Neutral Zone.

816
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,792
These ships carry a Romulan
invasion force

817
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:14,000
and must be stopped.

818
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:15,417
I repeat,

819
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:18,667
these ships carry
a Romulan inva...

820
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,625
Doctor, contact Dulisian Four
and confirm this distress call.

821
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:24,250
I have a feeling it
may prove to be a false alarm.

822
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:27,625
Mr. Worf, how long before
we intercept the Vulcan ships?

823
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:29,333
14 minutes, sir.

824
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:35,208
Communication lines
have been terminated

825
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,750
at the transmitter,
but I am quite certain

826
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:38,959
the message was sent
prior to the interruption.

827
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,375
Well done, Mr. Data.

828
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:41,834
You'll never get out
of this building.

829
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,375
I disagree, Commander.

830
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,750
After studying the design
of this structure

831
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:48,208
I have determined that
our best route of escape

832
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,792
would be the underground
exit to the east of this wing.

833
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:53,333
I've disconnected certain
security scanners to assist us.

834
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:59,875
I'm afraid we cannot allow you
to warn your guards.

835
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:06,792
Not bad.

836
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,709
The Vulcan defense vessels
are also responding.

837
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,625
The Romulan force is retreating
towards the Neutral Zone.

838
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:30,542
They're not taking those
Vulcan ships home with them.

839
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:31,834
Visual range, Commander.

840
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:33,667
On screen.

841
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:36,417
GEORDI:
Romulan warbird decloaking
alongside the Vulcan ships.

842
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:37,792
Red alert.

843
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,500
Advise the warbird to withdraw
from Federation space

844
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,500
and tell them to leave the
Vulcan ships where they are.

845
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,834
The warbird is powering up its
forward disrupter array.

846
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,208
Ready phasers.

847
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:59,250
There were over
2000 Romulan troops

848
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:01,125
on board those ships.

849
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:03,750
They destroyed
their own invasion force.

850
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:07,792
Rather than
let them be taken prisoner.

851
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:10,875
Stand down red alert.

852
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,792
Mr. Worf,

853
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:15,166
advise the Klingon ship to
signal us

854
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:18,041
as soon as Captain Picard
and Data are safely on board.

855
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,000
Aye, sir.

856
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,709
D'TAN:
This way.

857
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,375
Pardek never
saw these caves.

858
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,875
It's safe.
They won't find us here.

859
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,917
What will you do now?

860
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:27,375
What we have always done--

861
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:29,250
continue to teach

862
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:32,250
pass on the ideals
to a new generation

863
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:34,667
work for the day when new
thoughts may be spoken aloud.

864
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:39,667
The Federation will
welcome that day.

865
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:40,834
Captain, we will
need to reach

866
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:43,000
our transport site
in 14 minutes.

867
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,458
I wish you well.

868
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,792
Thank you.

869
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:56,500
Captain.

870
00:42:57,959 --> 00:42:59,583
I will not be
coming with you.

871
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:00,583
Ambassador...

872
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:02,291
The reason
for my coming here

873
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,583
has never been more clear.

874
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,583
The union of the Vulcan
and the Romulan people

875
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:10,875
will not be achieved
by politics or by diplomacy

876
00:43:10,917 --> 00:43:13,500
but it will be achieved.

877
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:17,208
The answer has been here
before us all along.

878
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,917
An inexorable evolution
toward a Vulcan philosophy

879
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,583
has already begun.

880
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,208
Like the first Vulcans

881
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,542
these people are struggling

882
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:29,000
to a new enlightenment

883
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,333
and it may take decades
or even centuries

884
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,166
for them to reach it

885
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,500
but they will reach it,

886
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:36,834
and I must help.

887
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:42,000
I have learned that it is
useless to argue with you

888
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:43,500
once your mind is set.

889
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:45,041
Not at all, Captain.

890
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:48,417
I have found our arguments
quite useful--

891
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:51,709
almost as useful as those
I had with my father.

892
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,208
Would it surprise you
to learn

893
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,750
that he found them
equally valuable?

894
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:02,291
Ironically...

895
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:05,500
you may know Sarek better
than his own son does.

896
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:09,834
My father and I
never chose to meld.

897
00:44:11,834 --> 00:44:13,208
I offer you the chance

898
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:17,250
to touch what
