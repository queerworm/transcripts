1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,750
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43917.4.</i>

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,709
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has been given</i>
<i>the singular honor of hosting</i>

3
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,834
<i>the first meeting</i>
<i>between the Federation</i>

4
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:14,417
<i>and a mysterious race</i>
<i>known as the Legarans.</i>

5
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:16,709
<i>We are in orbit around Vulcan</i>
<i>preparing to welcome aboard</i>

6
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:19,750
<i>Federation Ambassador Sarek</i>
<i>and his wife, Perrin</i>

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,625
<i>who, like his first wife,</i>
<i>is from Earth.</i>

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,125
I remember studying
his career in school.

9
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,041
The treaty of
Alpha Cygnus IX,

10
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,834
the Coridan admission
to the Federation,

11
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:29,917
the Klingon alliance...

12
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:31,917
I met him once,
many years ago

13
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:34,000
very briefly,
at his son's wedding.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,375
I can tell you

15
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,667
that was quite a moment
for a young lieutenant.

16
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,375
Standing in the presence
of such history.

17
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,750
I remember he spoke to me

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,041
and I just stood there,
grinning like an idiot.

19
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,709
Captain...<i> </i>
<i>You</i> tongue-tied?

20
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,583
Indeed. How do you make
small talk

21
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,166
with someone
who shaped the Federation?

22
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,583
Is it true he'll
be retiring after
this mission?

23
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,542
Unofficially,
that's what I hear.

24
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:52,500
What a crowning
achievement for his career.

25
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,166
The benefits of relations

26
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,875
with the Legarans
are incalculable.

27
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,583
Ah, Captain Picard.

28
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,250
I am Ki Mendrossen,

29
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,041
the Ambassador's
chief of staff.

30
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,291
This is Sakkath,

31
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,125
his personal
assistant.

32
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,667
Has the Ambassador
been delayed?

33
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:20,375
He will be joining
us momentarily,

34
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,000
but first, we must
discuss some matters

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
of the utmost delicacy.

36
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:30,875
Please go ahead.

37
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,208
To be frank, Captain,

38
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,583
the Ambassador is
not a young man.

39
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:35,959
He tires easily.

40
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,000
He's going to need

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,291
a lot of rest,
to prepare himself

42
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,959
for the difficult job
that awaits him.

43
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,083
Which is why it
is imperative
that he be allowed

44
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,875
to conserve
his strength.

45
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,000
I must request
that you dispense

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,959
with any formal
activities

47
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,000
normally associated with
a visitor of his rank.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,375
We had planned
a ship's concert
this evening.

49
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,875
I believe
that the Ambassador

50
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,083
is extremely fond
of Mozart.

51
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,709
I'm afraid it would be
impossible for him to attend.

52
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:03,709
Upon his arrival, he will be
taken directly to his quarters

53
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:05,458
where he will remain
in seclusion

54
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,291
until we reach Legara IV.

55
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,667
You have my assurance

56
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,375
that the Ambassador will not be
disturbed during the voyage.

57
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,083
That's all we ask.

58
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:18,166
Well, now that's settled.

59
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,917
The Ambassador is waiting.

60
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,875
PICARD:
Welcome aboard the<i> Enterprise,</i> 
Ambassador Sarek.

61
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,208
We come to serve.

62
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,166
Your service
honors us.

63
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,959
Allow me to present
she who is my wife.

64
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,166
Mrs. Sarek.

65
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,375
Please call me
Perrin, Captain.

66
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,417
This is my first officer,
Commander William Riker.

67
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,375
Captain, would
you be so kind

68
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,875
as to show us
to our quarters?

69
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,333
SAREK:
I prefer

70
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,291
to view
the conference room first.

71
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,000
MENDROSSEN:
Ambassador, I'm sure

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,333
Sakkath and I can
handle all the
necessary details.

73
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,875
I will examine it for myself.

74
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,750
Perhaps it would be best
if we settled in first.

75
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,542
They worry about my health,
Captain, too much.

76
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,291
You will take me
to the conference room, please.

77
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,875
If you'll follow me, sir.

78
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:03,625
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

79
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:08,041
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

80
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,333
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

81
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,375
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

82
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:17,667
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

83
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:21,917
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

84
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,417
WESLEY:
Are the Legarans

85
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:23,917
really going to sit
in this stuff?

86
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,709
LA FORGE:
Well,<i> I'm</i> sure not.

87
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,291
Can you believe
this smell?

88
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,834
What smell?

89
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:31,583
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
What can I say?

90
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,166
To us, it's a slime pit,
but, to them, it's home.

91
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,750
Okay, the environmental
controls are ready.

92
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,333
What's next?

93
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,667
What, are you in some kind
of a hurry or something?

94
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,542
Yeah, I have a date.

95
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,125
A date?
With who?

96
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,375
Ensign Dumont.

97
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,834
Really?

98
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:49,875
She's very attractive.

99
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,834
I got to admit, Wes,
though, I'm a bit surprised.

100
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:54,834
What? That she'd
go out with me?

101
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:57,083
No, that you'd actually have
the nerve to ask her.

102
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,166
Way to go.

103
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,792
The room is not ready.

104
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:10,291
No, Ambassador.
Commander La Forge

105
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,959
and Ensign Crusher
are still preparing...

106
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,917
The Legarans are
very sensitive

107
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,333
in matters of protocol.

108
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,792
You will remove
all the furniture from the room.

109
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,000
The walls must be bare.

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,417
I'm sure everything
will be set up

111
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:21,834
according to our
specifications

112
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:23,750
before the
Legarans arrive.

113
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,709
Isn't that
right, Captain?

114
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:28,291
I assure you, Ambassador,
everything will be ready

115
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,375
before the conference
begins.

116
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,917
My husband and I

117
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:34,834
have every confidence
in you, Captain.

118
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:36,125
SAREK:
I have worked
for 93 years

119
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,625
in preparation for this meeting.

120
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,250
It is<i> vital</i>

121
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,375
that no detail be overlooked.

122
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,375
Perhaps we should
allow these gentlemen

123
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,792
to return to their
work, Ambassador.

124
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,291
That will be acceptable.

125
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,208
These walls are too bright.

126
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:14,875
The way Mendrossen
described him,

127
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,750
I expected to see
a frail old man.

128
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,000
I hope<i> I'm</i> that frail
when I'm 202 years old.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,333
But his aides did seem
to be a little...

130
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,875
overprotective,
didn't they?

131
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,500
From what I could see,

132
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,750
the Ambassador doesn't need
protection from anything.

133
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,542
Well, we'll respect
Mr. Mendrossen's request

134
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:34,417
and allow Ambassador
Sarek his privacy.

135
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:36,709
I suppose they were
foolish and vain--

136
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,834
my expectations of this voyage.

137
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:42,417
Sharing his thoughts,
memories,

138
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:46,792
his unique understanding
of the history he's made.

139
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:49,750
Does this mean you're going to
cancel the concert this evening?

140
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,583
No, the concert
will go ahead
as scheduled.

141
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,375
But it's a pity our guest
of honor will be absent.

142
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,875
For all we know,
the Ambassador might enjoy

143
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,291
an evening's
entertainment.

144
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,959
Why not ask his wife
if she'd like to attend?

145
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,792
That's an excellent
idea, Counselor.

146
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,333
You have the Bridge,
Number One.

147
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,041
(<i> door chimes</i> )

148
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,000
Come in.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,208
PICARD:
I hope I'm not intruding.

150
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,834
Not at all, Captain.

151
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:23,500
But Sarek is
in meditation
at the moment.

152
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,166
Actually, I came
to see you.

153
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,000
Well, how nice.

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,875
I so rarely get
visitors of my own.

155
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,250
Usually everyone wants
to see the Ambassador.

156
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,959
I find that
hard to believe.

157
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,542
Thank you.

158
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:45,000
These quarters are
quite comfortable.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,583
The Ambassador and I
were very pleased
when we heard

160
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,291
that the negotiations
were going to take place

161
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,917
aboard the flagship
of the Federation.

162
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,458
The honor is ours.

163
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:58,000
My husband has taken
an interest in your career.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,959
He finds it to be...
satisfactory.

165
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,333
My word.

166
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,417
High praise from a Vulcan.

167
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:09,333
Some people who expect
an emotional response

168
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,125
often find Vulcans
to be quite cold

169
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,667
when they're merely being...

170
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,166
Logical.

171
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,250
Exactly.

172
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,333
I came to invite you--

173
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,500
and your husband,
if he's available--

174
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,500
to a Mozart recital
this evening.

175
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,250
What a tempting offer.

176
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:33,208
I... doubt that the
Ambassador will be
able to attend,

177
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,709
but I will make it
a point to ask him.

178
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,417
Well then,
I hope to see you this evening.

179
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:40,667
As do I.

180
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,000
You are still
unable to meditate?

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It is of no importance.

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,166
It has eluded you
for many weeks.

183
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,083
I said it is of
no importance.

184
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,166
You know I am right.

185
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,625
My wife, you will
leave me now.

186
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,125
I require solitude.

187
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,041
The temperature
in the tank

188
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,041
is now 150
degrees Celsius.

189
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,166
Okay, lock it off.

190
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:31,750
Is that it?

191
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,166
Can I get out
of here now?

192
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,750
What's your hurry?

193
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,625
You don't really think
anything's going to happen

194
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,166
with Suzanne Dumont,
do you?

195
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,625
At least I'm not
spending the night

196
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,250
with a good book,
like some people.

197
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,583
What's that
supposed to mean?

198
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,959
Just what it sounds like.

199
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,500
Let me tell
you something.

200
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,291
You'd get more action
out of a good book

201
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,166
than you'll ever
see on this date,
I'll guarantee it.

202
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,417
She's not going to waste her
time on someone like you.

203
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,542
Someone like me?

204
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,000
She's way out
of your league.

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,333
Since when did you become
an expert on women?

206
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,667
Compared to you, every
male on this ship

207
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,166
is an expert on women.

208
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,375
Well, at least
I don't have to find

209
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,500
my women in a holodeck.

210
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,959
What did you say?
You heard me.

211
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,542
Yeah, I heard you.
Just what do you think...

212
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:05,667
Something wrong?

213
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:14,041
I asked a question.

214
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,250
No, sir.

215
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,375
Nothing wrong here.

216
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,625
May I be excused,
Commander?

217
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,208
Anything you'd like
to talk about, Geordi?

218
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,208
No, sir.

219
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,500
I noticed that
Lieutenant Worf

220
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,625
has put Ensign
D'Amato on report

221
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,625
for insubordination.

222
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,166
D'Amato's been
an exemplary officer.

223
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,625
Indeed he has.

224
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,083
Could you look into it,
Number One?
Of course.

225
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,166
Good evening.

226
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,166
Good evening.

227
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,458
I assume that the work

228
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,166
is progressing
on the conference room.

229
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,500
Yes, I checked in

230
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,667
with Wesley and Geordi
a few hours ago.

231
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,542
There was a moment when
I actually thought

232
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,792
the two of them
were going to
hit each other.

233
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,917
Ambassador Sarek, Perrin--

234
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:12,417
on behalf of the
entire crew, welcome.

235
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,208
It was my wife's suggestion
that we attend.

236
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,834
It seemed
an ideal diversion.

237
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:20,041
Perrin can be
quite logical

238
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,041
when she chooses.

239
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,458
It seems that the Ambassador
had more free time

240
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,083
than I anticipated.

241
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,875
Commander Data will be

242
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,959
our featured soloist
this evening.

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,083
Data:
I have been programmed

244
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,583
to reproduce the individual
musical styles

245
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,375
of over 300 concert violinists

246
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,625
including Heifetz, Menuhin,
Grak-Tay, and Tataglia.

247
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,667
Do you have a preference?

248
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,709
Tataglia would be lovely.

249
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:50,709
I hope you find
the performance pleasing.

250
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,959
I look forward to it.

251
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,000
At your convenience, Mr. Data.

252
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,166
Please.

253
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,083
(<i> playing lively chamber music</i> )

254
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,166
(<i> tempo slows</i> )

255
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,667
(<i> inaudible</i> )

256
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,333
(<i> music crescendos</i> )

257
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,250
(<i> music decrescendos</i> )

258
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,667
(<i> door closes</i> )

259
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,583
Hi, Mom.

260
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,875
I got a message
you wanted to see me.

261
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,834
I thought you were
going to be at the
concert last night.

262
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:45,625
I said I<i> may</i> be going.

263
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,917
Suzanne wanted to go
to the arboretum.

264
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,458
Captain Picard asked me
where you were.

265
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,333
I don't like
making excuses for you.

266
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,792
Excuses?

267
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,709
Come on, Mom, it wasn't
an official function.

268
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,166
Listen, young man,
you have responsibilities

269
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,834
and I want you
to live up to them.

270
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,083
Don't you think you're
overreacting a little?

271
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't talk back to me!

272
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,166
Okay, I won't.

273
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,041
Where do you think
you're going?

274
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,333
Away from you.

275
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:21,417
And then I just slapped him.

276
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,291
Really hard.

277
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,959
I slapped Wesley.

278
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,542
Do you know why
you did it?

279
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:30,834
I've never hit my son
in his life.

280
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:33,166
Beverly, this
is important.

281
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,458
What were you thinking
when you hit Wes?

282
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,500
I wasn't thinking
about anything.

283
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,875
I was just angry.

284
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,792
And Wes didn't provoke
you in any way?

285
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,834
It wasn't anything he
said or anything he did?

286
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,500
No, that's just it.

287
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,166
It was a sudden
burst of anger.

288
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,875
I still can't believe
I did it.

289
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,166
I don't know why
you did it either,

290
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,083
but I can tell you

291
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,500
that I've heard
the same kind of story

292
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,333
from ten different people
over the last two days.

293
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,000
This is your
command center?

294
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,291
Yes.

295
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,625
It is normally occupied

296
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,291
by Captain Picard,
Commander Riker,

297
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,375
and Counselor Troi.

298
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,250
Counselor Troi
is a Betazoid?

299
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,667
Half-Betazoid.

300
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,250
Her father was human.

301
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,375
Then she is not
a true telepath.

302
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,667
Her skills
are empathic in nature.

303
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,417
She is able to sense
the emotions of other beings.

304
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:23,709
What is Captain Picard's
background in diplomacy?

305
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,959
Extensive--
the Captain's first

306
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,667
diplomatic contact
dates back to...

307
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,458
And what of his knowledge
of the Legarans?

308
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,917
Would he be able to
conduct negotiations

309
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,417
with them, should
the need arise?

310
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,625
Do you foresee
such a circumstance occurring?

311
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,792
Is Ambassador Sarek unable...?

312
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:40,417
Forgive me.
I was merely exploring

313
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:43,625
various possible permutations
of our mission.

314
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,083
Your tour of the Bridge
has been most informative.

315
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,458
Excuse me.
We were sitting here.

316
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,000
Well, we're
sitting here now.

317
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,041
Come on, fella,
this is our table.

318
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,333
Really?

319
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,917
Funny, I don't see
your name on it.

320
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,083
Didn't your mother
teach you manners?

321
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:14,041
LA FORGE:
Hey, hey, guys...

322
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,875
is there some kind
of problem here?

323
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,792
Well, there seems
to be some question

324
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,458
as to whose table
this is.

325
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:23,667
Well, there are plenty
of other tables, right?

326
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,917
I suppose you're right.

327
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,333
LA FORGE:
Why don't I get everybody

328
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,500
another round of drinks,
all right?

329
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,208
I don't have to tell you

330
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,083
that insubordination
is a serious charge

331
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,625
to be filed
against any officer.

332
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,291
I am aware of
that, Commander.

333
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,500
However, Ensign D'Amato

334
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,291
directly challenged
my authority.

335
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,458
Is it my imagination

336
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,667
or have tempers become

337
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:46,333
a little frayed on
the ship lately?

338
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,291
I hadn't noticed.

339
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,166
(<i> grunting and groaning</i> )

340
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,000
I see what you mean.

341
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,333
Security to ten-forward.

342
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,041
Geordi, what the hell
is going on here?

343
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,333
I wish I knew.

344
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,709
All right, that's enough!

345
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,542
LA FORGE:
The next thing I know,

346
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:30,250
somebody's left hook
is on its way to my chin.

347
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

348
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,375
Captain, this is not
an isolated incident.

349
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,959
There have
been reports

350
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,500
of random violence
all over the ship.

351
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,917
Are you suggesting
this is somehow contagious?

352
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:43,917
There's no indication
of any bacteria or virus.

353
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,625
I've run every test I know.

354
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,917
I've checked the water,
food replicator,

355
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:49,291
airborne samples...

356
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,250
This is a hell of a time.

357
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,667
Well, whatever it is,

358
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,417
I don't want it
to affect the Ambassador.

359
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:58,166
I want his quarters isolated
from the rest of the crew

360
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,875
until we've
identified the cause.

361
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,500
It's not that
simple, Captain.

362
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,333
CRUSHER:
We have determined that
the outbreak of violence

363
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,125
started at virtually
the same time

364
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,750
that Sarek and his party
beamed onto the ship.

365
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:17,959
We do have a working theory.

366
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,417
We believe
that it's possible

367
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,083
that Ambassador Sarek,
himself

368
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,875
is responsible
for these incidents.

369
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,250
Sarek?

370
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,792
I felt something
during the concert.

371
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:32,166
Vague and undefined,
but very disturbing.

372
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,625
He cried.
I saw that.

373
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,083
I couldn't
believe it.

374
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,875
A Vulcan moved to
tears by music? It's...

375
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,875
Well, Vulcans do have
the same basic emotions we do.

376
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,000
They've just learned
to repress them.

377
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,041
What I sensed
during the concert

378
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,166
was that he'd lost control.

379
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,417
What would cause such
a loss of control?

380
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,417
CRUSHER:
There's a very rare condition

381
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:56,792
that sometimes affects Vulcans
over the age of 200.

382
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:58,500
Bendii Syndrome.

383
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,792
Its early symptoms
include

384
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,500
sudden bursts
of emotion

385
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,583
mostly irrational anger.

386
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:07,041
Eventually,
all emotional control is lost.

387
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,625
I can imagine nothing

388
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,000
that would be more offensive
to a Vulcan.

389
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,709
Their emotional detachment
is the very core of their being.

390
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:18,250
Why would this
affect others
onboard the ship?

391
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,291
Vulcans possess
telepathic abilities.

392
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,917
Sarek may unintentionally
be projecting intense emotions

393
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,166
onto other people, at random.

394
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,458
And when the Legarans
beam aboard?

395
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:33,250
They could very well
be affected, too.

396
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,125
Is there a treatment?

397
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,750
Can't someone else
take his place?

398
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,959
Sarek has built a personal
relationship with them.

399
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,959
They will accept no one else.

400
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

401
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,458
Well, how can we confirm
your... diagnosis?

402
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,125
We can grow a culture

403
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,625
from the tissue
of the metathalamus,

404
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,417
but the results
will take several days.

405
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:59,959
I have 12 hours.

406
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,625
That's impossible,
Captain Picard.

407
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,834
I cannot delay
the conference--

408
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:07,125
not for a day,
not for an hour.

409
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,500
The schedule itself

410
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,917
required three months
of negotiations.

411
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:12,959
Nevertheless, we appear to
be facing a potentially...

412
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:14,667
I give you
my word of honor

413
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,917
that the Ambassador
is in perfect health.

414
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,083
Is that enough?

415
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,208
Mr. Mendrossen...

416
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,625
You are dealing

417
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,500
with a theory
full of holes, Captain.

418
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,083
Why am I not affected
by Sarek's supposed condition?

419
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,458
And Perrin, how could
his wife function normally

420
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:32,125
if this theory
of yours is correct?

421
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,792
I cannot explain that.

422
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:36,083
Hundreds of others onboard
have not been affected either.

423
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,709
I have not.

424
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:39,625
It appears to be random.

425
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,709
Proximity, apparently, has no
bearing on this phenomenon.

426
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:45,750
You are accusing
the greatest man of his time

427
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,583
of losing his mind

428
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,125
on the eve
of his greatest triumph

429
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:53,250
and you cannot explain why.

430
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:01,291
I won't report this
to the Ambassador.

431
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:02,875
For the moment.

432
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:06,375
I don't want to divert
his attention from the mission.

433
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:10,750
But if I were you,
in the interests of your career,

434
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,709
I'd be very concerned

435
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:15,792
about finding the real cause
of these outbursts

436
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:18,667
before the Legarans arrive.

437
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:28,875
Mr. Data, will you please
report to my ready room?

438
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,458
Aye, sir.

439
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,667
Captain Picard
is not satisfied

440
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,291
with Ki Mendrossen's
assurances

441
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,709
that the Ambassador
is in good health.

442
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:45,500
Do you consider Sarek

443
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,667
capable of carrying out
his mission?

444
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,542
Have I given you cause
to think otherwise?

445
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,625
You have voiced certain
reservations to me

446
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,583
about his abilities.

447
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:01,500
I do not recall
making such a statement.

448
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Not directly, no,
but you did question me

449
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
about the diplomatic
capabilities

450
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,750
of both Captain Picard
and Counselor Troi.

451
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,709
I am honor-bound

452
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:14,417
to help Sarek carry
out this mission.

453
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:17,792
That is the only
answer I can give.

454
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:21,291
Then you must decide which
is your greater obligation--

455
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:23,125
your loyalty to Sarek

456
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:26,000
or your duty
to the Federation.

457
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,083
Can you accept the logic
of continuing this mission?

458
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,917
Tell your captain...

459
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:40,375
the mission is in jeopardy.

460
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,583
Sakkath has been able,
until recently,

461
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,041
to use his telepathic skills
to reinforce

462
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:49,917
Sarek's emotional control,
thus protecting others

463
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:52,125
from the effects
of his deterioration.

464
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,208
He hasn't been doing
a very good job.

465
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,083
The strain
of this mission on Sarek

466
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,709
has made it impossible.

467
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,542
It's ironic,
isn't it?

468
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:03,000
All this magnificent
technology, we still
find ourselves

469
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,792
susceptible to the
ravages of old age.

470
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,208
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Loss of dignity.

471
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:14,125
The slow betrayal of our bodies
by forces we cannot master.

472
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,166
Do you still want to
be one of us, Data?

473
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,667
Sir, it is conceivable,
even for me,

474
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,583
that time
will eventually lead

475
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,291
to irreparable
circuit failure.

476
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:28,291
But there is one thing
I do not understand.

477
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:31,792
Sarek is a logical,
intelligent being.

478
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:34,417
The effects of Bendii Syndrome
are apparent.

479
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:37,208
Why would such a man
choose to ignore them?

480
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:40,417
Logic fails us sometimes, Data.

481
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:42,458
I think this is
one of those times.

482
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,166
I can only guess
that he does not see--

483
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:48,000
or he does not<i> wish</i> to see--
the truth,

484
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,375
and he is being insulated
against that truth

485
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,583
by those who love him most.

486
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,333
Someone has to confront him.

487
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,875
(<i> sighs, clears throat</i> )

488
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:04,417
Not a task that I'm
looking forward to.

489
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:05,458
I don't understand this.

490
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:06,583
Everyone is protecting Sarek--

491
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,041
his wife, Mendrossen,
even you.

492
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:13,250
What would you have me
do-- march down there
and destroy the man?

493
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,625
The mission with the Legarans
cannot be carried out

494
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,041
with Sarek
in this condition!

495
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:18,208
I know that!

496
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,291
Then tell him
that there is no way!

497
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,583
Don't you tell me what to do!

498
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:21,792
Captain, Commander...

499
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,000
Of course.

500
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,917
You're right,
Number One.

501
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:35,000
(<i> sighs</i> )

502
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,917
It's a task that
I will attend to.

503
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,583
Captain, I don't think
I understand

504
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,166
what you're telling me.

505
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,959
My husband is responsible

506
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:52,375
for your crew
assaulting one another?

507
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,959
He is very ill, Perrin.

508
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:01,458
Bendii Syndrome is

509
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:02,875
more a folk tale
than a disease.

510
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,709
There hasn't been
a true case of it

511
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:06,000
in my husband's lifetime.

512
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,291
There's one now.

513
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,625
Sakkath knows.

514
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:11,125
Sakkath?

515
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:14,709
Sakkath knows nothing my
husband didn't teach him.

516
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:16,083
He knows.

517
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,917
And more than that,
on this mission,

518
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:21,709
he has been consciously
holding Sarek's mind together

519
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,083
as well as he could.

520
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:26,375
That is not true.

521
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,417
I must see Sarek.

522
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:32,709
Captain, I know a good deal
about the Vulcan mind,

523
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:35,166
and I know a good deal
about the heart

524
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,750
of one particular Vulcan.

525
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,875
I am his wife
and he is fine.

526
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,458
He does not have
Bendii Syndrome,

527
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,000
and that shall
be the end of it.

528
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm sorry.
Please.

529
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,583
You mustn't do
this to him.

530
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,083
Must not do what, my wife?

531
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:59,000
If Captain Picard
wishes to see me,

532
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,750
he may do so.

533
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:12,375
I regret that we have seen
so little of each other

534
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,000
during this voyage, Captain.

535
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,500
The loss is mine,
Ambassador.

536
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,667
Captain, may I talk
with you in private?

537
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:21,041
You were speaking
of your belief

538
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:23,542
that I suffer from
Bendii Syndrome.

539
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:27,333
I have been accused
of many things in my life.

540
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,542
Never an excess of emotion.

541
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,375
PERRIN:
Sarek...

542
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:34,208
I see no reason to
continue this discussion.

543
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:35,667
On the contrary.

544
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,667
I wish to assuage any fears

545
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:41,583
the Captain may have
regarding my capabilities.

546
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:45,250
I believe there is a test
for Bendii Syndrome.

547
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,750
I will take it immediately.

548
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,250
Unfortunately, the results
would not be available

549
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,583
for several days,
which is why I must ask

550
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:57,709
for a postponement
of the conference.

551
00:28:57,709 --> 00:28:59,333
That would be a mistake.

552
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:04,750
Captain, I give you my word.

553
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,583
I am in perfect health.

554
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,583
Then...

555
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:12,917
why must Sakkath help

556
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,375
to contain your emotions?

557
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,959
Is what the Captain
says true?

558
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:24,417
No, Ambassador.
Absolutely not.

559
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,333
Perrin?

560
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,709
Were you aware
of this?

561
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:37,166
Sakkath, I await an answer.

562
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:40,208
I have been using
my limited abilities

563
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,375
to strengthen your
mental discipline.

564
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:46,458
Your efforts will
no longer be required.

565
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:49,333
That would not be wise.

566
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:54,166
It may not be wise,

567
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:57,041
but it is necessary.

568
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:03,542
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

569
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,959
Leave me.

570
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:09,208
I wish to speak
with Captain Picard.

571
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,333
Sarek, I asked you
to reconsider.

572
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,166
Obey my wishes.

573
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:16,125
There is nothing to fear.

574
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,709
(<i> door opens</i> )

575
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:26,500
(<i> door closes</i> )

576
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:33,583
I hope I've not
embarrassed you,
Ambassador.

577
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:36,792
You seem to forget, Captain,
that I'm a Vulcan.

578
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:39,792
I'm not affected
by emotional considerations.

579
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:42,208
I think you are
affected, sir.

580
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,500
Far more than
you realize.

581
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,333
I am a logical being.

582
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,291
Present your arguments.

583
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:50,667
I will listen.

584
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:53,417
There is an epidemic
of violent incidents

585
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,250
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

586
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,500
As we speak,

587
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,250
the situation
is worsening.

588
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,333
And it is your hypothesis
that I am the cause

589
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,959
of these incidents?

590
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,625
Yes.

591
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,834
My chief medical officer
has explored

592
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:09,583
all other probable causes.

593
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:11,917
I share your concern
for your crew.

594
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:13,834
However, you must agree

595
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:16,458
that it is not unusual
for a starship

596
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,000
to encounter
unexplained phenomena.

597
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,333
That is correct.

598
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,375
Therefore,
since I can assure you

599
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,625
that I am not the cause
of your difficulties,

600
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,083
the logical course would be

601
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,875
to have your doctor
continue the search.

602
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,083
She is.

603
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,959
It is also a fact
that these incidents began

604
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,583
shortly after your arrival.

605
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,208
Is your entire argument

606
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,750
to be based upon
mere coincidence?

607
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,875
Is it also coincidence
that your wife

608
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,917
and your chief of staff
are carefully isolating you?

609
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:49,125
Ah, I believe I see
the flaw in your logic.

610
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,709
You are reacting

611
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,875
to their overprotective
attitudes toward me.

612
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:57,542
They are somewhat emotional
concerning my age.

613
00:31:57,542 --> 00:32:00,500
Surely, Sakkath cannot be
influenced by emotion.

614
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,750
Am I to be blamed for
the judgment of a child?

615
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,166
Sakkath is young
and inexperienced.

616
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:08,333
He erred in his assumption
that I needed help.

617
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,166
But you needed his help
at the concert,

618
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:13,291
or is there possibly some
other logical explanation

619
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,583
for what happened
that night?

620
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,083
What happened?

621
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:18,750
I saw you crying.

622
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,208
I do not cry.

623
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:22,125
I was there.
I saw the tears.

624
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,208
You exaggerate, Captain.

625
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,750
I recall only one tear.

626
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,250
So you were emotionally
affected by the music.

627
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,291
That is not possible!

628
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:33,458
You still haven't answered
my question, Sarek.

629
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:37,125
Is it logical for
a Vulcan to cry?

630
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,291
It was late.

631
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,125
I was fatigued,
nothing more.

632
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,125
The Legarans trust only me.

633
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:46,333
They will not meet with any
other member of the Federation.

634
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:49,709
I must be allowed
to complete my mission.

635
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:51,709
There are no other
logical solutions!

636
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:53,792
No other logical
solutions?

637
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:55,458
But, Ambassador,
there are always
other solutions.

638
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,333
You have said
so yourself,
many times.

639
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,583
What I meant was that...

640
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,458
Sarek of Vulcan
would never be afraid

641
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,709
of looking straight
at something he did
not want to see.

642
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:04,291
I warn you.

643
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,792
Your efforts to discredit me
will not succeed!

644
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,291
Sarek of Vulcan

645
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:09,583
never confused
what he wanted
with the truth.

646
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,834
I will not be spoken to
in this manner!

647
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:13,750
Do I hear anger
in your voice?

648
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,667
It would be illogical
for a Vulcan to show anger!

649
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,917
It would be illogical!
Illogical!

650
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,208
Illogical!

651
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,041
Illogical!

I must speak with you,

I'll be on

676
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,500
How is the Ambassador?

00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,417

678
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:23,834
I've come to ask you

679
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:25,917
to reconsider
your position.

680
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:28,583
You know
that is impossible.

681
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,625
Sarek is a good man.

682
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:33,792
He's given the Federation
a lifetime of service.

683
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:38,250
I beg you to let him keep
the respect he has earned.

684
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,583
He'll never lose that respect.

685
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:43,750
Mendrossen and I never wanted
to deceive you.

686
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,750
My husband's condition
came on him so gradually,

687
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,166
it was easy for us
to delude ourselves

688
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,542
and pretend
that nothing was wrong.

689
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,500
We convinced ourselves

690
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,500
that he could complete
this one last task

691
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,041
and end his career
with dignity.

692
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,583
Help him, Captain.

693
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:07,166
Help him regain his pride,
his honor.

694
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:10,875
Believe me, it would
give me great pleasure,

695
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,750
but there is nothing I can do.

696
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,709
The mission can be saved...

697
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,583
but he needs your help to do it.

698
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:26,458
A mind-meld...

699
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,792
between the two of us?

700
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:33,834
Do you realize
the dangers involved

701
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:36,375
in what you are proposing,
Captain?

702
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,000
Yes, I do,
Ambassador,

703
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,458
but I also realize
the potential benefits.

704
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:47,458
We would be linked
telepathically--

705
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:48,834
sharing our thoughts

706
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:51,625
becoming, in essence,
one mind.

707
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,208
Which, for a few
hours, should provide

708
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,917
the emotional control
you need.

709
00:35:56,917 --> 00:36:00,041
In that time, you can
meet with the Legarans

710
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,959
and conclude the treaty.

711
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:08,250
It is a generous offer,
but I must warn you

712
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:12,083
that while I would gain
your stability,

713
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:15,291
you would experience
the fierce onslaught of emotions

714
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:18,166
unleashed by my condition.

715
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:21,291
Vulcan emotions
are extremely intense.

716
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,875
We have learned
to suppress them.

717
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:27,083
No human could control them.
They will overwhelm you.

718
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:30,542
The mind-meld can be
a terrible intimacy.

719
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:32,875
I cannot allow it.

720
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:35,875
I'm aware of the risks,

721
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,166
but it is the only...

722
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:40,750
logical solution.

723
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:47,583
Your courage
honors me, Captain.

724
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,792
I can't say I approve of this,
Jean-Luc.

725
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:55,625
I didn't expect that
you would, Beverly.

726
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:57,583
I don't suppose
I could talk you out of it?

727
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,125
I'm afraid not.

728
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:03,709
Though I do admit to a
certain... trepidation.

729
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:08,417
Your... your company
is much appreciated.

730
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:09,875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

731
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,125
Come.

732
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,000
I see that you
are ready, Captain.

733
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,291
Doctor Crusher will
monitor our responses.

734
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:21,333
A sensible precaution.

735
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:41,125
My mind to your mind.

736
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,834
Your thoughts

737
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:47,041
to my thoughts.

738
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:02,083
Commander, the Legarans
are ready to beam aboard.

739
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,166
Very well.

740
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,542
SAREK:
Number One?

741
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:08,417
Please inform
the Legaran delegation

742
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:13,959
that Sarek of Vulcan
is on his way to welcome them.

743
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,667
Yes, Ambassador.

744
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:21,417
I take it the mind-meld
was a success.

745
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:23,500
Yes, all went
as planned.

746
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,917
Is Captain Picard
all right?

747
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,917
Don't worry, Number One.

748
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:31,542
And... the Ambassador?

749
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:35,709
I am myself again.

750
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:38,625
It has been a long time.

751
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:44,417
No!

752
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,250
It is...

753
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,792
it is... wrong!

754
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:50,375
It is wrong!

755
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:53,208
A lifetime of discipline
washed away

756
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,291
and in its place...

757
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,625
(<i> chuckles</i> )

758
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:02,208
(<i> grunting</i> )

759
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,917
bedlam.

760
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:05,000
Bedlam!

761
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,500
(<i> panting</i> )

762
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,875
I'm so old.

763
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,083
There is nothing left

764
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,959
but dry bones...

765
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:16,875
(<i> voice breaking</i> ):
Dead friends.

766
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:20,291
Oh... tired.

767
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,208
Oh, so tired.

768
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:25,000
It will pass,
all of it.

769
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,500
Just another hour or so.

770
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,125
You're doing fine,
just hold on.

771
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:31,125
No! This weakness disgusts me!

772
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,500
I hate it!

773
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,333
Where is my logic?

774
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,834
I am betrayed by...

775
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:43,458
desires.

776
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:46,875
I... oh...

777
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,875
I want to feel...

778
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:52,959
I want to feel

779
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:56,458
everything.

780
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:59,875
But I am a Vulcan.

781
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:03,375
I must feel nothing.

782
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:06,917
(<i> sobbing</i> ):
Give me back my control.

783
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,041
(<i> slapping table</i> ):
Jean-Luc!

784
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,625
Per...

785
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,542
Perrin.

786
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,959
Amanda...

787
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:31,166
I wanted... to give you
so much more.

788
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:35,250
I wanted to show you such...

789
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,792
(<i> gasping</i> )

790
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:43,417
tenderness.

791
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:47,834
But that is not our way.

792
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:49,834
Spock...

793
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,208
Amanda...

794
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,917
did you know...?

795
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:03,875
Perrin, can you know...

796
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:06,125
how...

797
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:09,041
(<i> sputtering</i> ):
much I...

798
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,583
love you?

799
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:15,208
I... do...

800
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:18,000
love you!

801
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,250
(<i> sobbing</i> )

802
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,291
Beverly...

803
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:37,792
I'm here, Jean-Luc.

804
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,834
I'm not going anywhere.

805
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:43,583
It's... quite difficult.

806
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:50,208
The anguish of the man.

807
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:53,208
Despair...

808
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,625
pouring out of him.

809
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:57,333
All those feelings.

810
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,834
(<i> sobbing</i> ):
The regrets...

811
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:03,625
I can't... stop them.

812
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:07,083
I can't stop them.

813
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:10,500
I can't. I can't.

814
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,041
Don't even try.

815
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:16,917
(<i> sobbing</i> )

816
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:29,834
RIKER:
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43920.7.</i>

817
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:32,125
<i>Ambassador Sarek has</i>
<i>successfully concluded</i>

818
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,542
<i>the negotiations</i>
<i>with the Legarans.</i>

819
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,458
<i>The USS</i> Merrimack
<i>has arrived</i>

820
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:37,667
<i>and will transport</i>
<i>the Ambassador</i>

821
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,667
<i>and his party back to Vulcan.</i>

822
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:42,333
I hope your journey
aboard the<i> Merrimack</i> 
will be uneventful.

823
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:44,750
With the pressures
of the conference behind him,

824
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,083
I believe I can help him
maintain his control

825
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,417
until we return to Vulcan.

826
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:50,166
What will happen
to him then?

827
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:53,750
The effects
of Bendii Syndrome
are irreversible.

828
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,083
Medical research is always
continuing, of course.

829
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,583
RIKER:
Mr. O'Brien, stand by
for transport.

830
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,500
Aye, sir.

831
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,667
Thank you, Captain.

832
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:14,375
He loves you...

833
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:17,125
very much.

834
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:19,291
I know.

835
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,834
I've always known.

836
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:29,458
I will take my leave
of you now, Captain.

837
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:32,917
I do not think
we shall meet again.

838
00:43:32,917 --> 00:43:35,875
I hope you are
wrong, Ambassador.

839
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:38,208
We shall always retain

840
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:42,291
the best part
of the other inside us.

841
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:45,208
I believe<i> I</i> have
the better part

842
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,625
of that bargain,
Ambassador.

843
00:43:50,834 --> 00:43:53,375
Peace and long life.

844
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:58,083
Live long and prosper.
