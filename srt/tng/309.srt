1
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:32,959
Someone sure stripped
this place.

2
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,834
(<i> clattering</i> )

3
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,917
The reactor's gone.

4
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:49,709
No wonder they didn't answer
our hail for two days.

5
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,959
Nothing here
to answer with.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,458
Commander, I am
detecting life signs

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,041
from behind that door.

8
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,417
Worf?

9
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,792
Commander, take a look at this.

10
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,542
Blood.

11
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,125
Yes, but not human.

12
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,834
I'm going to have to
do some analysis on it.

13
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,834
(<i> grunting</i> )

14
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,208
It's jammed.

15
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,458
(<i> metallic scraping</i> )

16
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:08,417
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

17
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:12,417
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

18
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

19
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:18,291
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

20
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:22,625
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

21
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:27,291
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

22
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:29,834
(<i> tricorder pulsing</i> )

23
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,125
The two scientists
are suffering

24
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,875
from phaser stuns.

25
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:45,041
I'd guess
several hits each.

26
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,375
Several?

27
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,458
It'll take us a while
to bring them around,

28
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,208
but they will recover.

29
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,208
We found a sample
of blood.

30
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,917
It's a rare
iron-copper composite

31
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,333
unique to one
humanoid species--

32
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,417
the Acamarians.

33
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,834
Acamarians?

34
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:09,250
Then that would suggest
the Gatherers.

35
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,917
It is a
likely hypothesis.

36
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,291
The nomadic marauders

37
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,583
who refer to themselves
as Gatherers

38
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,834
have raided other outposts
in neighboring sectors.

39
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,500
But they've never come out
this far before.

40
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:24,750
Mr. Crusher, set course
for the Acamar system.

41
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,375
Aye, sir.

42
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,333
PICARD:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43421.9:</i>

43
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,417
<i>In an effort to put an end</i>
<i>to the Gatherer raids,</i>

44
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,750
<i>we have come</i>
<i>to the Acamar system</i>

45
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:42,291
<i>to enlist the aid of Marouk,</i>
<i>the Sovereign of Acamar III.</i>

46
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,417
PICARD:
Their raids have made
this sector unsafe.

47
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,291
They've ransacked
our research facilities,

48
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,208
our trade routes
have been disrupted.

49
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,166
The Gatherers
are elusive.

50
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:54,208
We've only managed to capture
a handful of them.

51
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,625
But with
the Starfleet's help...

52
00:04:56,667 --> 00:05:00,750
Hunting them down
is not what I am proposing.

53
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:03,208
Reconciliation
with the Gatherers

54
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,458
is impossible.

55
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,959
It's been tried.

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,583
Every time
we've offered amnesty,

57
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,959
they've rejected it.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When was
the last attempt made?

59
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,709
Eighteen years ago.

60
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,458
Eighteen years?

61
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
For almost a century now,
they've been parasites

62
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:21,291
moving from star system
to star system,

63
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,291
living on what they could find

64
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,500
or steal.

65
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,667
They're still your people.

66
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,625
No. Captain...

67
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:32,125
you have to understand
our history.

68
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,667
A hundred years ago,

69
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,792
before the Gatherers split off
from our culture,

70
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:40,375
we were a savage, violent race.

71
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,834
Clans battled clans,

72
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,250
bloody, vengeful feuds
that lasted for generations,

73
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,208
but we overcame
those ways

74
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,250
all except
for the Gatherers.

75
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,792
After a century of wandering,
they may be ready to come home.

76
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,750
PICARD:
Despite your progress,

77
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:00,625
you are a divided society,
and so it will remain

78
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,959
until the Gatherers
return to Acamar.

79
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,125
The attempt may be futile.

80
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,375
But there is so much to gain

81
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:13,208
and there is so little to lose
by the effort.

82
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,208
This problem affects us all.

83
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,709
It cannot be ignored.

84
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,375
Sovereign Marouk,
welcome to the Bridge.

85
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:26,792
Thank you, Captain.

86
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:30,166
How soon will you be ready
to leave Acamar?

87
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,458
I'm ready now, Captain.

88
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,792
I need only bring aboard
two more servants.

89
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:36,375
I'll see to that,
and to your accommodations.

90
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,500
I have reason to believe

91
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:43,333
there is a Gatherer encampment
somewhere in the Hromi Cluster.

92
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,709
Mr. Data?

93
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,208
The Federation
has charted,
but not explored

94
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,208
several Class-M
planets in that area.

95
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,250
Any one of these
planets might serve
well as a base.

96
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,250
Mr. Crusher, set course
for the Hromi Cluster.

97
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,375
Aye, sir.

98
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:03,834
(<i> beeping</i> )

99
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,125
A fine ship, Commander.

100
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:24,542
RIKER:
We're all very
proud of her.

101
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,625
Yuta...

102
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,625
a light meal
in 20 minutes.

103
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:32,375
May I be shown
the kitchen, Commander?

104
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,750
You're the chef?

105
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,166
Yes, I'll prepare all meals

106
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,709
for the Sovereign
and her servants.

107
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,709
Well, we can provide
you with a kitchen,

108
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,125
but it won't really
be necessary.

109
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,458
These food dispensers

110
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,125
can synthesize anything
that you may need.

111
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,291
I'll show you.

112
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,375
Sovereign, may I offer you
a drink?

113
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:49,792
Yes, thank you.

114
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,166
Cold water.

115
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,875
Computer, a glass of water,

116
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:55,417
five degrees.

117
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,125
(<i> beeping</i> )

118
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,625
Please.

119
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:11,375
You're also the food taster?

120
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:14,542
That's part of
the cook's duties.

121
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:24,458
I'm sure the Sovereign
will wish to sample

122
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,667
many of the cuisines
your ship has to offer,

123
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:29,500
but there are some
Acamarian dishes

124
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,000
that she will
insist upon.

125
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,709
I will arrange
for a technician

126
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,458
to help program your recipes
into the computer.

127
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,875
Of course, I'll have
to try some of them.

128
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,667
What's your specialty?

129
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:39,875
I have none.

130
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:41,208
Don't be modest.

131
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,792
You can't tell me

132
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:46,125
you haven't come up
with a few culinary delights.

133
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:50,542
There is a spiced<i> Parthasdish.</i>

134
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,208
<i>Parthas...</i>

135
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,875
A green vegetable
with fleshy roots.

136
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,500
<i>Parthas a la Yuta.</i>

137
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:59,333
I look forward
to tasting it.

138
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,500
Sovereign.

139
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,375
Chef.

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,041
Now entering standard orbit
of Gamma Hromi II, sir.

141
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:23,208
Captain, I am detecting life
readings from the planet surface

142
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,583
as well as several
small areas of
thermal radiation

143
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,750
and carbon dioxide emissions
indicative of combustion.

144
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,875
Campfires, Data.

145
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,125
Is that not what I said?

146
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,250
It's worth a look.

147
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,709
Make it so.

148
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,000
Data.

149
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,375
Worf.

150
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,625
Artonian lasers.

151
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,959
Tonkian homing beacons.

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,458
Quite a collection.

153
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,834
DATA:
Noranium
alloy, sir.

154
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,583
Its salvage value
is quite low.

155
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,333
Looks like these Gatherers
weren't too discriminating

156
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,583
about what they steal.

157
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,917
WORF:
Commander.

158
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,375
(<i> clanging</i> )

159
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:20,083
Ambush!

160
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,333
Regalian phaser rifles, sir.

161
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,875
Not particularly powerful.

162
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,208
Powerful enough.

163
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,208
We came to talk!

164
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,792
Your words are wasted,
Commander.

165
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,583
They understand only this.

166
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,083
We're here to establish
a dialogue, Worf.

167
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,792
RIKER:
Data, tell me about noranium.

168
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:05,500
It vaporizes at...?

169
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,125
2,314 degrees, sir.

170
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,875
Of course,
noranium car...

171
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,166
Thank you, Data.

172
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,542
Setting seven
ought to do it.

173
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,875
(<i> beeping</i> )

174
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,834
Three, two, one...

175
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,667
now!

176
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:28,208
<i>Enterprise,</i>
four to beam up!

177
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,875
Cowards!

178
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,750
Your ambushes would be
more successful

179
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,208
if you bathed more often.

180
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,125
We've brought
the Sovereign of Acamar.

181
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,333
Marouk? Here?

182
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,166
With an offer of amnesty.

183
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:12,125
SOVEREIGN:
Full dispensation
will be extended

184
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,667
to all Gatherers who are willing
to return to Acamar III.

185
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:18,291
You don't trust me,
Marouk.

186
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,667
Should I?

187
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:22,125
But you expect me
to trust you.

188
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,875
Maybe you just
poisoned it yourself.

189
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,667
Taste this, Temarek.

190
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,625
(<i> laughter</i> )

191
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,125
(<i> laughter continues</i> )

192
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,500
Barbarians.

193
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,834
This is futile.

194
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,375
PICARD:
Sovereign...

195
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,375
Brull!

196
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:53,917
Go home, old woman.

197
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,041
You people haven't changed
in a hundred years!

198
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,750
You should know.

199
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,166
You were there.

200
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,625
Sit down!

201
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,709
Please.

202
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,959
Please.

203
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,041
Now, we're here to talk.

204
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,125
It's a waste
of time, Captain.

205
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,750
They don't care
about how they live.

206
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:24,709
Am I supposed to believe
that<i> you</i> care how we live?

207
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,458
Yes.

208
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,000
Brull, she's here, isn't she?

209
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,750
Maybe you forced her to come,
Picard.

210
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:37,333
Nobody forces me anywhere,
Brull.

211
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,750
What is there for us
on Acamar III?

212
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:43,291
A life, a home.

213
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:48,750
You can end your wanderings,
your miserable existence.

214
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,792
Do I look miserable to you?

215
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,458
(<i> laughing</i> )

216
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,709
The clan wars are over, Brull.

217
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,625
It is a past we're ashamed of.

218
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:05,917
It is why you had to leave.

219
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:10,792
Now... it is time to come home.

220
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,250
I want to speak privately

221
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,166
with Sovereign Marouk
and Picard.

222
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,959
Everyone else,
get out.

223
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,917
Any insights?

224
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,917
Brull's ready
to negotiate.

225
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,667
He just wants
privacy so that
he won't appear weak

226
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,542
in front of the
other Gatherers.

227
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,417
(<i> mumbling</i> )

228
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,500
(<i> mumbling continues</i> )

229
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:20,959
You are of the
clan Lornak.

230
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,750
What of it?

231
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,959
I-I've seen...
I've seen you before.

232
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,417
Yes.

233
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:35,125
But... but it's...
it's impossible.

234
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,458
No. Look closer.

235
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,291
I am Yuta, of the clan Tralesta.

236
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,417
(<i> gasping in pain</i> )

237
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,792
(<i> raspy breathing</i> )

238
00:16:54,834 --> 00:17:01,667
I am the last of my line,
but my clan will outlive yours.

239
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,917
(<i> raspy breathing</i> )

240
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,458
(<i> breathing stops</i> )

241
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,917
Marouk's offer has value.

242
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,750
Commander!

243
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:22,542
But still,
I don't know.

244
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,291
But you'll agree

245
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,834
it is enough
to present to
your leader.

246
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,625
Chorgan is a better judge
of these matters.

247
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,375
I will take it to him.

248
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,583
You'll hear from me
in 20 days.

249
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:39,375
Brull, in 20 days,
I hope to be very far from here.

250
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:41,542
With all due respect, Brull,

251
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:46,166
I would like to make the offer
to Chorgan myself.

252
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,875
We'll gladly take you
with us on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

253
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:52,375
How many of your
men do you want
to accompany you?

254
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:53,959
I'll come alone.

255
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If this is a trap...

256
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,959
Oh, it isn't.

257
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:03,500
Mallon, you'll be in charge
while I'm gone.

258
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,834
If I am not back in ten days...

259
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,834
TEMAREK:
Brull! Brull!

260
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,041
Volnath...

261
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,041
Away team to<i> Enterprise.</i>

262
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,458
Medical emergency.

263
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,625
Volnath was an old man.

264
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,542
There's nothing to be done.

265
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:28,041
There's a chance that
our doctors can do something.

266
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,583
You found him?

267
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,083
Yes, and there are no other
members of Lornak clan here,

268
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,667
so I claim his possessions.

269
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:38,083
Granted.

270
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,250
Have you no respect
for the dead?

271
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,417
What's there to respect
about a corpse?

272
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,834
(<i> arguing</i> )

273
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,417
(<i> arguing continues</i> )

274
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,000
BRULL:
Temarek, no!

275
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,000
He's been dead too long.

276
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,500
RIKER:
How?

277
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,166
Cardiac arrest.

278
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,208
You don't sound convinced.

279
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,458
No, he died of a heart attack,
all right,

280
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,625
but I can't find the cause.

281
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,583
His cardiac muscle is strong

282
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,041
and there's no sign
of arterial occlusion.

283
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,959
(<i> doors open</i> )

284
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:44,000
Brull, will you show Mr. Crusher

285
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,250
the course to set
to the Hromi Cluster?

286
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,083
A child?

287
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:53,667
This doesn't inspire
my confidence.

288
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,250
This is our
present position.

289
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,458
Set a heading for
3-4-3 mark 7-2.

290
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,083
That's going
to take us

291
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,583
through the center
of an asteroid belt.

292
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,041
Hey, what's the matter, kid?

293
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,500
Can't you fly yourself
around a couple of rocks?

294
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:34,500
Sure, I can, but if
we take<i> this</i> heading,

295
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:37,834
we can avoid the belt
completely

296
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,458
and only lose
12.1 minutes at warp 7.

297
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,667
Have it your way, kid.

298
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,875
For centuries,
my planet was in chaos.

299
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:58,750
Loyalty to one's clan
was absolute.

300
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,834
The slightest injury
to one member

301
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,500
demanded violent
retaliation.

302
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:07,625
And these blood feuds
could last for decades?

303
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,667
The obsession
with vengeance

304
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:10,834
would be passed

305
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,166
from generation to generation,

306
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,792
and with each act
of retribution,

307
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:18,291
the violence would escalate.

308
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:24,709
It's not unlike much of
the history of my own planet.

309
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,709
Your pardon, Sovereign.

310
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,375
May I be excused briefly?

311
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:30,709
Commander Riker requested

312
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,083
that I prepare him
an Acamarian dish.

313
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,667
Of course, Yuta.

314
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:45,125
Hey...

315
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,667
What are you doing?

316
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:04,083
Homework.

317
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,250
What is this?

318
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,667
Math.

319
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:09,125
I can see that, but
what does it mean?

320
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,750
This is the locally
Euclidean metrization

321
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:15,834
of a K-fold contravariant
Riemannian tensor field.

322
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,000
You any good at it?

323
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,250
You don't like me.

324
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,333
I didn't say that.

325
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,917
No problem.

326
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:29,625
I have many friends
that don't like me,

327
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,959
but what do you know about me?

328
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,333
You're a thief.

329
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,583
I steal to survive,
not because I enjoy it.

330
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,750
We Gatherers value our freedom.

331
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:42,417
We do what we want
and we answer to no creature.

332
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,333
Then why are you helping
Sovereign Marouk

333
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,917
to change all that?

334
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:50,125
Maybe because I want
something better

335
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:53,667
for me and for my children.

336
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:56,166
<i>You</i> have children?

337
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,291
Yeah.

338
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,625
Two sons.

339
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:01,834
One's just about your age.

340
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,750
He's not any good at math.

341
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,166
<i>Parthas a la Yuta!</i>

342
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:23,667
With the help
of one of your food stations.

343
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,166
It's wonderful.

344
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,291
Truly excellent.

345
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,375
Thank you.

346
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,875
Would you care
to join us?

347
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,041
I don't want to intrude.

348
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:42,417
You're not.

349
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:45,083
I was just leaving anyway.

350
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,959
Please sit down.

351
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,625
It really is delicious.

352
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:00,417
I'm glad it pleases you,
Commander.

353
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:01,709
I'm not your Commander.

354
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,041
My name is William.

355
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,667
I will call you William,
if you prefer.

356
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,583
I do. When you say "Commander,"

357
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:10,000
you say it like you say
"Sovereign" to Marouk.

358
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:13,291
As a servant.

359
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:21,333
You're an excellent Commander,
but you'd make a poor Sovereign.

360
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,542
Why's that? Not that I disagree.

361
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,250
You're not comfortable
with servants.

362
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,959
No, I prefer the company
of equals.

363
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,542
So you treat me as an equal.

364
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,500
And you're not comfortable
with that?

365
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,125
I'm not used to it.

366
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,333
I've always been a servant.

367
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,542
Not that I'm complaining.

368
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,834
The Sovereign treats me well.

369
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,500
I have all
that I could want.

370
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:47,417
What about freedom?

371
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,542
I can never have that.

372
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:56,417
Because you're the property
of the Sovereign?

373
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,291
No, I'm not her slave.

374
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,583
I can leave whenever I wish.

375
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,625
But you have no place to go?

376
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,750
Just the opposite.

377
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:09,417
My path is all too clear.

378
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:15,333
Yuta, you're an excellent chef,
but you speak in riddles.

379
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:21,166
I've never been very good
at conversation.

380
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,375
SOVEREIGN:
Yuta?

381
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:34,166
I believe the Sovereign
wants me to return.

382
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,750
Enjoy the<i> Parthas.</i>

383
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,208
BEVERLY:
Sick Bay to Commander Riker.

384
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,041
I've discovered something
interesting, Will.

385
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,667
On my way.

386
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,750
You're scowling, Doctor.

387
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,166
I'm thinking.

388
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,375
And?

389
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:06,709
The old Gatherer
on the planet?

390
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,875
I know what caused
his heart attack.

391
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:11,375
The medical tricorder
almost missed it,

392
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:14,333
but there was a microvirus
in his body

393
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:17,166
blocking his autonomic
nerve impulses.

394
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,375
And that stopped
his heart?

395
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:22,917
But here's the really
interesting part.

396
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,375
This microvirus will
only attach itself

397
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:31,834
to cells with a very specific
DNA sequence.

398
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,792
How specific?

399
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:36,917
Without knowing more
about their genetic makeup,

400
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:40,125
I can't be sure, but my guess is

401
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:45,667
this virus would only kill
one Acamarian in a million.

402
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:47,417
Pretty single-minded bug.

403
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:48,959
<i>Too</i> single-minded.

404
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,166
I can't believe

405
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,667
it's a naturally
occurring virus.

406
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:54,500
Meaning someone engineered it?

407
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:57,542
Meaning Volnath was murdered.

408

to your request for access

00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,709

414
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,083
Good.

415
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,500
Notify Dr. Crusher

416
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:27,667
when Acamar's medical database
is online.

417
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:29,583

419
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,500
Come in.

420
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:41,500
I'm disturbing you.

421
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:42,792
Not at all.

422
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:49,083
As...

423
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,417
the Sovereign has
no further need

424
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,250
for my services
this evening,

425
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:56,083
she suggested I
might spend some
time with you.

426
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:59,917
What a charming suggestion.

427
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:05,709
She appreciates the...

428
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,375
affection you've shown me.

429
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:10,542
Was I that obvious?

430
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:13,875
Yes.

431
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:16,709
Well, I've already dined.

432
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,917
Maybe you know
a good Acamarian dessert recipe.

433
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,709
Does that not please you?

434
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,667
Tell me what you want, William.

435
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:38,792
I will do anything you wish.

436
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:41,750
Wait a minute.

437
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:43,458
I don't understand.

438
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,667
Don't you want me
to give you pleasure?

439
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:48,000
Not as a servant.

440
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,792
I told you, I prefer equals.

441
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:53,375
Even in the matters of love?

442
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:56,667
Especially in matters of love.

443
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:59,750
I've offended you.

444
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:04,583
No, I only want to make you
as happy as you want to make me.

445
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,667
You're entitled to that.

446
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:09,083
No.

447
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,417
I'm not.

448
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,667
Yuta...

449
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,542
I do not feel
pleasure or passion.

450
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:21,959
I haven't been able
to for a long time.

451
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,917
I don't know
who did this to you

452
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:35,125
or why,

453
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,917
but it can change.

454
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:41,125
I wish it could.

455
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:44,709
Tonight most of all.

456
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,625
I'm sorry.

Your people
have prepared
a warm welcome.

461
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:12,000
That's Chorgan's ship.

462
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,333
Shields holding.

463
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:19,542
Mr. Worf,

464
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,083
contact Chorgan.

465
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,709
Tell him Brull has brought us
to talk.

466
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,542
Chorgan is not responding.

467
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:35,542
Mr. Worf, can we knock
out their shields

468
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,166
without seriously
damaging their ship?

469
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,083
I believe we can, sir.

470
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:43,417
Prepare phasers
and open a channel.

471
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,667
WORF:
Phasers locked.

472
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:45,959
Channel open.

473
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,875
Chorgan, this is
Captain Jean-Luc Picard

474
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:49,458
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

475
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:53,291
All right.

476
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,083
Let's focus their attention.

477
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:01,041
Mr. Worf, fire phasers.

478
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:10,125
Their forward shields
are inoperative.

479
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,250
Well done, Lieutenant.

480
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,208
(<i> communications beep</i> )

481
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,250
We are being hailed, sir.

482
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,083
That's better.

483
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,834
On screen.

484
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:23,875
Brull, you traitor!

485
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:26,041
You have led them here
to destroy me!

486
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,417
Chorgan, if I had
wanted you destroyed,

487
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,709
you would not
be talking to me now.

488
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,083
Obviously,
I wanted something else.

489
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,083
And what is that?

490
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,458
I have onboard
Sovereign Marouk
of Acamar III.

491
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,959
I want you to hear what
she and Brull have to say.

492
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,333
She's worth
listening to.

493
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,417
I don't wish to listen
to either of you.

494
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:44,542
You have no choice.

495
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:45,709
Prepare to receive us.

496
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,959
We are beaming onboard.

497
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,750
Picard out.

498
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:50,083
Cancel red alert.

499
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,667
Tell Sovereign Marouk

500
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,875
to meet me in
Transporter Three.

501
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:55,083
Aye, sir.

502
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,041
You're going alone, Captain?

503
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,834
The danger is
minimal, Number One.

504
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,375
Chorgan is unlikely
to do anything rash

505
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:04,041
with the<i> Enterprise's</i>
phasers trained on his ship.

506
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,709
There are still risks.

507
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,709
For these negotiations
to succeed,

508
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,375
I must be a mediator,
not an enforcer.

509
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:15,542
You have the
Bridge, Number One.

510
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,542
Brull.

511
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,500
Chorgan.

512
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:37,750
This is Sovereign Marouk.

513
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,542
You may sit.

514
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:49,458
Chorgan, I think you will
find Marouk's proposal...

515
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,750
You know, Picard...

516
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:54,375
I could take you prisoner.

517
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:57,458
Oh, don't worry.

518
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,667
I've no intention of doing so.

519
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:03,500
I know what trouble it's been
for you to get here

520
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:05,458
and I am curious why.

521
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,125
Then let's proceed.

522
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:11,583
Quite simply, I'm proposing
amnesty for every Gatherer.

523
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:14,125
Amnesty?!

524
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,917
You mean slavery.

525
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,083
BRULL:
Chorgan,

526
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,583
if you want to know
what I think...

527
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,500
I don't.

528
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,500
Say what you
came to say,

529
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,041
but I doubt I'm going
to believe you.

530
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:29,208
I didn't believe this very
persuasive Federation Captain

531
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,083
when he suggested
we could reconcile
our differences.

532
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,583
I'm convinced now
it is the right thing.

533
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:37,625
Not just for you,
but for us, too.

534
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,417
We need you back.

535
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:44,792
I've brought

536
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,792
some Acamarian brandy.

537
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:50,166
I'm sure it's been a long time.

538
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,375
Hmm...

539
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:52,625
No.

540
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,583
You have spent a
century hunting us down.

541
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,875
She is trying to put an end
to all that.

542
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:58,667
Yes, and luring
us back

543
00:33:58,709 --> 00:34:00,375
and putting us
in prison.

544
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:03,041
No, by accepting you back
as free men.

545
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,625
Will you feed us
and clothe us, too?

546
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:07,625
No, of course I won't.

547
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,166
What I will do

548
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:12,375
is give you the means
to feed and clothe yourself.

549
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:15,000
We've set aside some land
and you can use it to...

550
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:17,041
(<i> laughing</i> )

551
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:22,083
Land?

552
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:25,333
Do we look like farmers to you?

553
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:26,583
Then don't farm.

554
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,542
Use the land as you wish;
it's yours.

555
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,959
And the moment
you set foot on it,

556
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,125
you'll be better off
than you are today.

557
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,667
You won't be running any longer.

558
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:39,542
We will need autonomy.

559
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:40,667
Autonomy?!

560
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:42,709
PICARD:
Sovereign,
if we can

561
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,291
at least acknowledge

562
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:47,083
that Chorgan appears willing
to discuss your offer...

563
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:51,792
There are many levels
of autonomy.

564
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:55,959
Certainly your region
would have certain rights.

565
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,542
Yes.

566
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:02,041
And those rights
will be spelled out

567
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:05,250
before I agree to anything.

568
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,625
Commander, I am afraid

569
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,834
the only entry
we have on Volnath

570
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,792
in the Acamarian database
is a birth record.

571
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:14,458
Probably one of the last
of the Gatherers

572
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,041
to be born on their planet.

573
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,792
(<i> doors open</i> )

574
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:20,875
Commander, I've been digging
through the medical database

575
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:22,458
from Acamar III for hours

576
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,542
and I have found another victim
of the same microvirus

577
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,875
that killed Volnath

578
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:30,667
but only one-- 53 years ago--

579
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:32,667
a gatherer named Penthor-Mul.

580
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:33,959
Data,

581
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,625
anything in your file
on Penthor-Mul?

582
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,291
Yes, sir.

583
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:40,333
He was a member
of the Lornak clan.

584
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,917
He was captured

585
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:45,125
while leading a Gatherer raid
on an Acamarian outpost.

586
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:48,667
He died of a heart attack
before his trial ended.

587
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,083
Display Volnath's
birth record again.

588
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,792
Lornak... the same clan.

589
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:04,208
The only two recorded deaths
by this microvirus--

590
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,750
both from the same clan.

591
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,500
What does that tell us, Doctor?

592
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:10,583
If these microbes
were engineered for murder,

593
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:14,375
I'd say somebody could be
going after a whole family.

594
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:16,291
DATA:
Commander,

595
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:18,959
Chorgan, the present leader
of the Gatherers,

596
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,917
is also from the Lornak clan.

597
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,875
I want to know
how this clan was involved

598
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,667
with the Acamarian blood feuds

599
00:36:24,709 --> 00:36:27,583
and I'd like to know any clue
as to who their enemies were.

600
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:30,041
How could this virus
have been transmitted, Doctor?

601
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,500
More ways than I can count.

602
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,500
And it's perfectly safe
to the carrier

603
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:36,166
as long as he doesn't have
the same DNA patterns.

604
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:38,166
Tailor-made for their enemies.

605
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:41,208
Commander, 80 years ago

606
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,083
the Lornaks massacred
a rival clan, the Tralestas.

607
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,959
It ended a feud
that had lasted for 200 years.

608
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,041
Ended it?

609
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,417
According to
these records,

610
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,041
there were no survivors.

611
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,041
The Tralestas were annihilated.

612
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:57,500
BEVERLY:
Something tells me
they weren't all wiped out.

613
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:00,333
There must be
a missing link here.

614
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:03,333
Computer, any members
of the Acamarian delegation

615
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,000
from the Tralesta clan?

616
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:08,500
Clan affiliation
is not within provided records.

617
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:13,250
Sir, I believe I have found
a correlation

618
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:18,417
between the two deaths--
your "missing link."

619
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:26,166
DATA:
That is Penthor-Mul
being led from his trial.

620
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:29,000
I don't see
the connection.

621
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,959
Behind him and to the left, sir.

622
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,500
Computer, scan
left and magnify.

623
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:39,542
The computer can extrapolate

624
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,750
and reconstruct the rest
of the face, sir.

625
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,792
Do it.

626
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,667
But that photograph
was taken over 50 years ago.

627
00:37:56,458 --> 00:38:01,542
Fifty-three years ago
and she hasn't aged a day.

628
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,875
Three seats
on the ruling council?!

629
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:18,625
If we're going to be subject
to your law,

630
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:20,625
we want a part in making it.

631
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:24,166
Well, I agree you're entitled
to representation,

632
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:26,709
but not on the ruling council.

633
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,250
Unacceptable.

634
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:30,875
The real power
is in the council.

635
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:33,125
You're shutting us off already.

636
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:35,667
No, you're trying
to take too much.

637
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:38,083
No group has three seats
on the council.

638
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:40,709
I don't care what others have.

639
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,834
You only care
about what you can take!

640
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:48,125
Sovereign,
if the situation were reversed,

641
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:53,083
I'm sure you would be demanding
equal levels of representation.

642
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:56,667
You're right, Captain.

643
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:01,667
I apologize for my temper.

644
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:17,709
Perhaps a brief pause
would be helpful.

645
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,542
I agree.

646
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:22,542
Hmm...

647
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:26,792
Maybe a little touch
of that brandy?

648
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:28,667
Yuta.

649
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:30,792
PICARD:
You know--

650
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:32,625
thank you-- it is remarkable

651
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:35,333
how very much alike
the two of you actually are.

652
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,709
CHORGAN:
That's ridiculous.

653
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,166
SOVEREIGN:
Really, Captain.

654
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,583
No, I'm quite serious.

655
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:42,834
You are both
able negotiators,
strong leaders.

656
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,250
We don't obey
weak leaders.

657
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:45,792
We have nothing
in common at all.

658
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:47,375
We haven't agreed
to anything.

659
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:49,291
You're wrong, Chorgan.

660
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,583
You have agreed
to have some brandy together.

661
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:56,875
RIKER:
Don't move.

662
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:58,291
A Federation trap.

663
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:01,291
Chorgan, I assure you
my First Officer

664
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,834
has a very good reason
for his actions.

665
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,583
You do, Number One?

666
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:09,583
Yuta, move away
from Chorgan.

667
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:10,709
Do it.

668
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,166
Why?

669
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:15,792
Because of a man you once knew
named Penthor-Mul.

670
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:17,166
Penthor-Mul?

671
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,208
How do you know Penthor-Mul?

672
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,458
Tell him, Yuta.

673
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,417
I don't understand.

674
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:25,792
You were with
Penthor-Mul
when he died.

675
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:27,792
It was 50 years ago.

676
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:29,291
How could I...?

677
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,417
I know, Yuta.

678
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:32,500
Stop.

679
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:33,625
Chorgan...

680
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:35,125
keep perfectly still.

681
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,917
Your life
is in danger.

682
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,709
Step back, Yuta.

683
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:42,500
William, this is
not your concern.

684
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:44,208
It is now.

685
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,375
You're about to commit a murder.

686
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:48,667
It isn't murder.

687
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,542
It's justice.

688
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,125
Who are you?

689
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:55,500
Yuta of the clan Tralesta.

690
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:57,917
There-there are
no more Tralestas.

691
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:02,083
Five survived
the last Lornak raid,

692
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:04,667
but on that day,
a century ago,

693
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:10,667
my life ended
and my search began.

694
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:14,917
I was the one chosen,
transformed.

695
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:17,917
My cells were altered

696
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:19,500
and my aging slowed

697
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:22,625
enough to finish my task.

698
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:24,166
SOVEREIGN:
You used me

699
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:27,208
in order to get to the last few
you couldn't reach.

700
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,458
Yes, Sovereign.

701
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,333
You will never
leave this ship alive.

702
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,291
You're the last.

703
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:40,083
Once you're dead, what happens
to me doesn't matter.

704
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,834
The wars are over, Yuta.

705
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:45,458
You cannot understand.

706
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,291
RIKER:
You're right,
I can't

707
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,917
because I've seen
the part of you

708
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:50,166
that regrets
what you've become.

709
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,375
Listen to me.

710
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:53,959
You don't have
to do this anymore.

711
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,500
I have no choice.

712
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:01,583
You do.

713
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:05,125
William, I...

714
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,625
I'm sorry.

715
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:10,792
Stop!

716
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:12,208
(<i> gasping</i> )

717
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,583
(<i> adjusts setting</i> )

718
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,917
(<i> adjusts setting</i> )

719
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:30,959
Yuta...

720
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,834
Don't do this.

721
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:08,166
Commander, I am
in your debt.

722
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:37,583
Oh, yes, thank you.

723
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,667
CREWMAN:
Hello, sir.

724
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:44,583
New orders
from Starfleet.

725
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,583
The rendezvous--
nothing, thank you--

726
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,542
the rendezvous
with the<i> Goddard</i>

727
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:49,834
has been postponed.

728
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:52,083
In the meantime?

729
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:54,333
Starbase 343.

730
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,458
We are to take on
medical supplies

731
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,709
for the Alpha Leonis system.

732
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,834
Sounds pretty routine.

733
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:03,250
Well, with the Gatherer truce
in effect,

734
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,583
it certainly should be.

735
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:08,709
Oh... we won't require
a full ship's complement.

736
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:12,500
I'm going to extend
shore leave on the Starbase

737
00:44:12,542 --> 00:44:14,375
to anyone who wants it.

738
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:20,834
I'll pass that along
to the crew, Captain.
