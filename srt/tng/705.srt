1
00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:04,000
<i>Last time on</i> Star Trek:
The Next Generation...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,417
My friend tells me
you might know

3
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:07,041
about that man
we're looking for.

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,041
There was a group of aliens
sitting at this table.

5
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,333
He was asking them questions.

6
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:13,291
One of them took out
a weapon and fired.

7
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:14,959
He was vaporized.

8
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:16,667
This is about justice.

9
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:19,834
The captain died in a
bar fight for nothing.

10
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:22,166
(<i> yells</i> )

11
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:38,250
Those ruins have been
studied for centuries.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,542
There's nothing new
to learn from them.

13
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:42,250
Then what were<i> you</i>
doing there?

14
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,333
(<i> gasping and moaning</i> )

15
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,250
Baran wouldn't last
five minutes as captain

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,125
if he didn't have that
control device.

17
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:53,291
That almost sounds
like a prelude to mutiny.

18
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,417
They captured me.
They wanted to find out

19
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:57,875
how much I knew
about their operation.

20
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,250
And then you became
part of their crew?

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,208
I convinced them
I was a smuggler.

22
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,041
Will, these are not
common thieves.

23
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,250
They are stealing
Romulan artifacts

24
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,959
from archaeological sites
throughout this sector.

25
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:15,291
Mr. Worf...

26
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,709
prepare to drop shields.

27
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,166
Sir... we would be
totally defenseless.

28
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,792
I am aware of that.

29
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:23,417
Fire!

30
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,041
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

31
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,458
Direct hit to
the port nacelle.

32
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,458
Only minimal damage.

33
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,291
Hit to the starboard nacelle.

34
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,291
Still, no appreciable damage.

35
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,125
Will must have done something
to their weapons.

36
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,291
I believe you
are right, Counselor.

37
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,500
It is now up to us
to play along.

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,917
Release inertial dampers and cut
power to decks 31 through 37.

39
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:57,417
ENSIGN: Aye, sir.
Set phasers to 25%.

40
00:01:58,542 --> 00:01:59,792
Return fire.

41
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,792
Aye, sir.

42
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,834
Continue firing!

43
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:11,083
I've lost three plasma
relays on the disrupters.

44
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,458
Auxiliary power is...

45
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,125
is not available.

46
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,667
Transfer weapons control
to my station.

47
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:20,166
There's a way to bypass
the relays and feed power...

48
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,291
The antimatter containment
units are starting to buckle.

49
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,959
The<i> Enterprise</i> has
been badly damaged,

50
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,875
but they still have
superior firepower.

51
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,750
If we remain here,
we will be destroyed.

52
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,208
The logical course of
action is to withdraw.

53
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,375
(<i> explosion</i> )

54
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,792
We've done
enough damage.

55
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,041
Narik, set course.

56
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:45,458
180, mark 215.

57
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,375
Warp six.
Initiate.

58
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,166
They're preparing to activate
their warp drive, Commander.

59
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,417
Sir, we cannot track them

60
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:59,125
with our sensors
if they go to warp.

61
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,625
I can still disable them by--

62
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,625
I'm aware of the tactical
situation, Lieutenant.

63
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,959
Let them go.

64
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:48,375
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

65
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:52,542
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

66
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,375
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

67
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:58,125
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

68
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:02,458
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

69
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:07,083
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

70
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:10,000
I've gone over
every word,

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,583
every inflection,
every facial response,

72
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,917
and I still can't find

73
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:15,583
any kind of code
or hidden message.

74
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,458
I agree the existence
of such a message is remote,

75
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,959
but I believe we should check.

76
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,250
I'll keep trying.

77
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,125
Two starships have been sent

78
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,625
to intercept
the mercenaries

79
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,333
at Yadalla Prime and Draken IV,

80
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,500
in case they attempt
to attack those planets.

81
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,959
Inform Starfleet Command

82
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,917
that we will hold position
until further notice.

83
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,458
So... we are just
going to remain here?

84
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,709
Yes, but we will
continue to pursue

85
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,500
all avenues of
investigation.

86
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,000
If we had not let them escape,
this would not be necessary.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,875
That is correct,
but I believe

88
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,250
Commander Riker wanted
us to let them escape.

89
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,375
LA FORGE: Commander?
Think I found something.

90
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,959
I've been studying the
com link Commander Riker used

91
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,000
to transmit his
command codes.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,834
I didn't see anything at first,
but then I ran the transmission

93
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:04,625
through a subharmonic
analysis, and I found this.

94
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,542
It was sent by the same carrier
wave as the command codes.

95
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,750
It might be the message
we've been looking for.

96
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,083
Possibly.

97
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,917
I will attempt to
resequence the signal.

98
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,875
Begin running a search
for a decryption key.

99
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,417
I'm taking the
engines off-line.

100
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,500
How long will it take to
repair our battle damage?

101
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,417
It will take at
least five hours

102
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:32,083
to replace the anti-matter
containment unit.

103
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,166
You have three hours, Narik.

104
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,959
One minute beyond that,

105
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,250
and you'll answer
for it with your life.

106
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,542
I suppose
I should thank you.

107
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,792
None of us would be alive
if it weren't for you.

108
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,041
You're welcome.

109
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,208
What's wrong, Commander?

110
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,417
You having second thoughts
about betraying your comrades?

111
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,625
Because that's
what you've done--

112
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,542
betrayed them.

113
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:04,250
Betrayed them in order
to save yourself.

114
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,792
You used to be just
a second-rate officer.

115
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,750
Now, you're a traitor
and a coward.

116
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,667
How does that feel?

117
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,291
(<i> groans</i> )

118
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,458
I don't know.
How did<i> that</i> feel?

119
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,792
Enough!

120
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,458
Galen, go down to
the cargo hold.

121
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,291
Check out
those artifacts.

122
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,625
Move!

123
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:41,166
You can tell Baran that I'm
working as fast as I can.

124
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,792
What?

125
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:47,291
I'm trying to decide

126
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,875
if you're incredibly stupid
or incredibly smart.

127
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,917
Why didn't you
continue to fire

128
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,166
on the<i> Enterprise</i> when
their shields dropped?

129
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,834
You were there.
The disrupters lost power.

130
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:01,333
Computer, reset for
diagnostic of new sample.

131
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,834
Begin scan.

132
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:05,917
I've watched you handle
the weapon systems before.

133
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:09,792
You know exactly how to
bypass a problem like that.

134
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:12,834
And why do you continue
to argue with Riker?

135
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,959
It should be obvious
that by alienating Riker

136
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,500
you also alienate Baran.

137
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,875
And yet, you continue
to do so. Why?

138
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,667
COMPUTER:
Scan complete.

139
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,750
Terikon profile negative.

140
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,458
Computer,
reset diagnostic

141
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,166
for new sample and
begin scan.

142
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,375
Look, this isn't a
Romulan labor camp.

143
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,500
I don't have to
answer your questions.

144
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,667
And I don't give a damn
what you think.

145
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,667
COMPUTER:
Scan complete.

146
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,375
Terikon profile
positive.

147
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,375
98% probability of match.

148
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,542
Well...

149
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,291
whatever it is
we're looking for,

150
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,834
it seems that
we've found it.

151
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,500
Tallera to Captain.

152
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,917
BARAN:
Yes, what is it?

153
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,750
I'm in the cargo hold.

154
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,792
Galen's made a positive terikon
match on one of the artifacts.

155
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,709
Good. Bring it
to me immediately.

156
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,542
Don't let anyone
get near it.

157
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,875
TALLERA: Understood.
Tallera out.

158
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,875
That sounds
like good news.

159
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,542
Very.

160
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:10,834
It means we've
completed half

161
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:14,667
of what promises to be a
very profitable mission.

162
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,542
And even better than that,
I'm almost ready

163
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:19,792
to get rid of
your friend, Galen.

164
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,041
Really?

165
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,458
There's one more
artifact to find.

166
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:28,458
Once Galen confirms
that it's genuine,

167
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,417
his usefulness
on this ship

168
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:33,458
will come to a
very sudden end.

169
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,500
I can't say I'm sorry
to hear that.

170
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,333
Galen might be a
loudmouthed fool,

171
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,959
but sometimes,
he's quite perceptive.

172
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,750
His observations
about you, for instance.

173
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,208
Oh?

174
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,959
After what you
did on Calder II,

175
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,959
I doubt if you have
much of a future

176
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,583
in Starfleet.

177
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,834
Hmm...

178
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:56,625
Yes... I must say

179
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,291
I've come to the
same conclusion.

180
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,709
(<i> chuckles</i> )

181
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:01,125
Hmm.

182
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,709
Well, assuming that you
were not my prisoner,

183
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:06,083
what would you do now?

184
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,834
I guess I'd start looking
for a new career.

185
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,083
Ah.

186
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,625
There must be a
place where someone

187
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,667
with 15 years of Starfleet
technical knowledge

188
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,500
would be useful.

189
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,291
You wouldn't happen to
know a place like that?

190
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,667
Well... well, possibly.

191
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,583
However, there's one thing that
I've learned on this ship,

192
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,166
and that's to be cautious...

193
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,917
and never to
blindly embrace

194
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,250
what might appear to be
good fortune.

195
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,834
And right now,
you're a rather large

196
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,667
stroke of good luck.

197
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,291
I haven't exactly sworn
my undying allegiance

198
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,375
to you, either, Baran.

199
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,709
For instance,
I'd like to know

200
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,667
a little bit more
about this job.

201
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,583
Such as?

202
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,875
Such as, what you meant by
"very profitable mission."

203
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,333
Well, it's enough to know
right now that your share

204
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:01,667
would insure you a very
wealthy and long life

205
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,458
far from
the Federation.

206
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,125
Sounds promising.
It is.

207
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,125
Only you're gonna
have to earn it.

208
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,792
And you can start
by putting aside

209
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:12,291
your dislike for Galen
and becoming his friend.

210
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,375
Why?

211
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,917
Galen has allies
on this ship.

212
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:18,917
That could cause trouble...
if I decide to kill him.

213
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:21,917
I want you to find out
from him who they are.

214
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,417
Okay.

215
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,375
One more thing, Riker.

216
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,792
When the time comes...
I want you to kill Galen.

217
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,875
I have completed
my analysis

218
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,500
of the signal from
the mercenary ship.

219
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
I believe these groupings
represent bearings

220
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,792
and coordinates taken from
their navigational system.

221
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:53,250
So, you think this is
their flight plan?

222
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,792
Yes. If I am correct,
the mercenary ship

223
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,583
is headed toward
these coordinates

224
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,250
in the Hyralan sector.

225
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,542
Well, their maximum
speed is warp 8.7.

226
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,667
It would take them
at least 14 hours

227
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,125
to reach that position.

228
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,625
We could be
there in five.

229
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,083
Make it so.

230
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,667
Finally.

231
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,834
WORF: Set a course
for the Hyralan sector

232
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,959
and engage at warp nine.

233
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,750
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

234
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,917
Lieutenant?

235
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,834
May I see you in
the ready room?

236
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,291
Of course.

237
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:34,333
Lieutenant, I
am dissatisfied

238
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,083
with your performance
as first officer.

239
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,625
May I ask in what way?

240
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,667
You continually question my
orders in front of the crew.

241
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,750
I do not believe this is
appropriate behavior.

242
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,542
With all due respect, sir,

243
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:47,166
I have always felt free
to voice my opinions,

244
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,417
even when they
differ from those

245
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,083
of Captain Picard
or Commander Riker.

246
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,000
That is true, but in those
situations, you were acting

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,959
as head of security,
not as first officer.

248
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,959
The primary role of the
second in command

249
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,917
is to carry out the
decisions of the captain.

250
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:01,291
In this case, me.

251
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:06,041
But is it not my duty to
offer you alternatives?

252
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,500
Yes. But once I have
made a decision,

253
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,291
it is your job
to carry it out

254
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,750
regardless of how you
may personally feel.

255
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,667
Any further objections
should be given to me

256
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,583
in private, not in
front of the crew.

257
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,250
I do not recall
Commander Riker

258
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,125
ever publicly
showing irritation

259
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,375
with his captain, as
you did a moment ago.

260
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,875
No, sir.

261
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,166
If you do not feel capable
of carrying out this role,

262
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,625
I will assign it
to Commander La Forge

263
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,458
and return you to tactical.

264
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,542
I would not enter it into
your record as a reprimand--

265
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,125
simply as a transfer.

266
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,500
I would prefer to remain
at my current post.

267
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,083
Then I expect you to conform

268
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,166
to the guidelines
I have laid out.

269
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,750
Aye, sir.

270
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,250
Dismissed.

271
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,875
Mr. Worf.

272
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,417
I am sorry if I have
ended our friendship.

273
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,834
Sir.

274
00:13:57,834 --> 00:14:02,166
It is I who has jeopardized
our friendship, not you.

275
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,625
If you will overlook
this incident,

276
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,583
I would like to continue
to consider you my friend.

277
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,333
I would like that,
as well.

278
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,041
Thank you, sir.

279
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,667
Good to see you, too.

280
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,417
I've had some
unpleasant surprises.

281
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,834
Will, this isn't
a good idea.

282
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,375
Baran might
grow suspicious.

283
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,250
As a matter of fact, it was
Baran who sent me here.

284
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,959
He told me to<i> pretend</i>
to be friendly with you,

285
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,917
help you organize a mutiny,

286
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:52,250
so that he can determine who
your supporters are in the crew

287
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,083
and then
eliminate them.

288
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,959
Oh, what a tangled
web we weave.

289
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,667
I have difficulty remembering
whose side I'm on.

290
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,667
So, what have you been
able to find out?

291
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,542
When we reach the
Hyralan sector

292
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,583
we're supposed to rendezvous
with a Klingon transport ship.

293
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,959
I'm not sure, but I think
they may be delivering

294
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,000
another of the Romulan
artifacts to us.

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,500
A second artifact?

296
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,458
Oh, by the way,
that first artifact

297
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,667
is not Romulan--
it's Vulcan.

298
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,375
Vulcan?
Mm-hmm.

299
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,583
I have been looking over
the glyphs and pictograms

300
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,959
from the Calder II
artifact.

301
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:25,792
And although I don't
have enough data

302
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,959
to translate all
the inscriptions,

303
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,542
the alphabet and the symbology
is much more consistent

304
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:33,667
with early Vulcan
than Romulan.

305
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,709
Do these artifacts
have some religious

306
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,458
or cultural significance?

307
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,959
Something that would make them
valuable enough to kill for?

308
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,834
I don't know.

309
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,959
If I could just get access

310
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,750
to the<i> Enterprise</i> computer,
just for a few moments.

311
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,041
(<i> sighs</i> )

312
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,959
So, what will Baran do

313
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,000
once he's obtained
the second artifact?

314
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,333
You're supposed to
verify its authenticity.

315
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:08,750
Then I'm supposed to kill you.
Then I take your place.

316
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,333
Will, you always seem
to be after my job.

317
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,959
Well, as soon
as Baran feels

318
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:15,542
that I've outlived
my usefulness,

319
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:19,500
he can kill me simply
by using the neural servo.

320
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,542
So, I think we had better
start planning a mutiny.

321
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,792
We need a new captain,

322
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,792
and I've come to one
inescapable conclusion.

323
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,917
I agree, but I don't
think that's you.

324
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,291
Oh?

325
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,291
I don't trust you, Galen,
and I don't think

326
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,834
the rest of the
crew does either.

327
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:40,500
They're not gonna
follow you.

328
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,125
And who will
they follow-- you?

329
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:46,000
No. But they will
follow Tallera.

330
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,667
And so will I.

331
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,625
Who are you?

332
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,792
What?

333
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,250
You're no smuggler,

334
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,208
and I don't think
your name's Galen.

335
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,583
You will tell me who
you really are

336
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,208
and what you are
doing on this ship,

337
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,417
or I will kill you
right here.

338
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,458
What are you
talking about?

339
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,291
I will not play
games with you.

340
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,750
I found the message you
sent to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

341
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,041
When Riker was using
his command codes

342
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,000
to drop their shields,
you sent them a transmission

343
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,709
on the same
carrier wave.

344
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,625
You're a Starfleet
officer.

345
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,917
Do not deny it.

346
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,667
It is the only
logical conclusion.

347
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:38,125
My name is
actually T'Paal,

348
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,834
and I am a member
of the V'Shar.

349
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,417
Vulcan security?

350
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,041
That is correct.

351
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,000
I infiltrated
this ship a year ago

352
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,542
posing as a Romulan
mercenary.

353
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:53,959
I'm here to investigate a
possible threat to Vulcan.

354
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:56,083
What sort
of threat?

355
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,125
First things first, Galen.

356
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,542
Who are you?

357
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,125
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

358
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,917
Very well.

359
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:10,625
To answer your question,
for several years now

360
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,709
there has been a
small, but growing movement

361
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:15,208
of extreme isolationists
on Vulcan--

362
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,875
a group that believes
contact with alien races

363
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,709
has polluted our culture

364
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,375
and is destroying
Vulcan purity.

365
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,083
This group advocates

366
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,000
the total isolation of Vulcan
from the rest of the galaxy

367
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,709
and the eradication
of all alien influences

368
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,166
from our planet.

369
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,500
That sounds like...
an illogical philosophy.

370
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,208
Agreed.

371
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:41,208
But extremists often have
a logic all their own.

372
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,792
Tell me, Tallera.

373
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:45,625
What are these artifacts
that we've been collecting?

374
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,834
I know that they are
Vulcan in origin.

375
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,291
I'm sure you are
familiar with

376
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,917
the ancient history
of my people--

377
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:57,375
before we found logic,
before we found peace.

378
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,500
You were much
as my people once were--

379
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,417
savage, warlike.

380
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,375
There was even a time

381
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,166
when we used our telepathic
abilities as a weapon--

382
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,959
a time when we learned
to kill with a thought.

383
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,041
The Stone of Gol?

384
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,750
You know of it?

385
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,291
I know the story
from Vulcan mythology.

386
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,375
The Stone of Gol is real,

387
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,333
but there is nothing
supernatural

388
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,000
or magical about it.

389
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,125
It is a psionic
resonator--

390
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:30,792
a device which focuses and
amplifies telepathic energy.

391
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,542
It is one of the most
devastating weapons

392
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,041
ever conceived.

393
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,166
But according to the legend, the
stone was destroyed

394
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,166
by the gods when the Vulcan
people found their way to peace.

395
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,959
The resonator was believed
to have been destroyed

396
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,834
during the Time
of the Awakening.

397
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:47,625
Only one piece is known
to have survived,

398
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,667
and it was placed in a
Vulcan museum under heavy guard.

399
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:54,333
A year ago, that piece was
stolen from the museum.

400
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,917
Soon after,
mercenary ships began

401
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:59,458
raiding archaeological sites
across the quadrant.

402
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,542
We believe a member
of the Isolationist Movement

403
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:05,542
is attempting to
reassemble the resonator.

404
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:07,500
A telepathic weapon.

405
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,417
My orders are to find
that assassin and stop him.

406
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:15,583
It would seem that Baran has
to deliver these artifacts

407
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,083
to the assassin
in order to get paid.

408
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,250
Therefore...

409
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,667
you and I should continue
our masquerade.

410
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,041
Agreed.

411
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:32,250
But, Captain, I cannot allow
the resonator to be assembled.

412
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,083
If necessary, I will destroy
this ship, its crew--

413
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,250
all of us-- to prevent
that from happening.

414
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:48,500
DATA:<i> Acting Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47160.1.</i>

415
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,917
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is entering</i>
<i>the Hyralan sector,</i>

416
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,291
<i>which I believe to be</i>
<i>the next destination</i>

417
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,125
<i>of the mercenary ship.</i>

418
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,500
I'm picking up
a small vessel

419
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,542
bearing 127, mark 335.

420
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:02,875
Is it the mercenary ship?

421
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,000
No, sir,
it's a Klingon ship.

422
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,166
A Toron-class shuttlecraft--
one person.

423
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,875
Open a channel.

424
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,875
This is Lieutenant
Commander Data

425
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,583
of the Federation
Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

426
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,417
Koral.

427
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:26,625
I take it that is your name?

428
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,750
May I inquire
as to your destination?

429
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,875
No.

430
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,166
DATA: May I ask the
purpose of your journey?

431
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,750
No.

432
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,959
Perhaps I have not made
our intentions clear.

433
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:45,291
We are
investigating...

434
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:55,000
He seems most...
uncooperative.

435
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,917
He may have been curt, but
he was also very worried

436
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,959
and even a
little scared.

437
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:02,542
Sir... may I<i> recommend</i>

438
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,792
that we bring the shuttlecraft
aboard with our tractor beam,

439
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:07,417
search it
and interrogate Koral?

440
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,542
According to the terms of
the Klingon Federation Treaty,

441
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:13,375
Koral has every right
to free transit

442
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,959
through Federation space.

443
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,250
We cannot board or search
his vessel without cause.

444
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,959
Yes, sir.

445
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:23,625
However, the treaty
does give us the right

446
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:26,333
to conduct health and safety
inspections on any ship

447
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,709
in our space.

448
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:29,709
Health and safety inspections?

449
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:32,709
I am not certain that
using this clause

450
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:34,417
as an excuse to
conduct a search

451
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:36,667
would be consistent
with the spirit

452
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,542
of the treaty.

453
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,792
Yes, sir.

454
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,000
However...

455
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,709
if Koral wishes to
contest our actions,

456
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,417
he can file a protest with the
Judge Advocate General's office.

457
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:53,709
Bring the shuttle aboard.

458
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:56,875
Then you and Dr. Crusher
may begin the inspection.

459
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,125
Aye, sir.

460
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,333
Hello.
I'm Dr. Crusher,

461
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,208
and this is Lieutenant Worf.

462
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,333
We're here to
conduct a health

463
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,250
and safety inspection
of your ship.

464
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,667
"Health and safety
inspection."

465
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,959
That's right.

466
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:37,083
Uh, you know, um...
radiation leaks,

467
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:41,166
um... biochemical
contamination, um...

468
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,875
other health hazards.

469
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,792
(<i> whispering</i> )
Excuse me.

470
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:00,542
Well, no radiation so far.

471
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,750
I'm sure you're glad
to hear that.

472
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,333
Right.

473
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,959
(<i> console beeping</i> )

474
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:08,375
There's an
incoming message.

475
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,208
It's from the Klingon shuttle.

476
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:13,125
It was sent approximately
15 minutes ago.

477
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,583
He's at the rendezvous
coordinates

478
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,834
but he's been detained
by the<i> Enterprise.</i>

479
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,500
And that's all there is.
He's stopped transmitting.

480
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,208
The<i> Enterprise?</i>

481
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,959
Now, how could
they have found out

482
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,667
about the rendezvous,
Commander?

483
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,166
BARAN:
Quiet!

484
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,208
All that matters now
is that the<i> Enterprise</i>

485
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,792
has the second artifact
in their possession.

486
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:32,125
We don't have
a choice.

487
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,792
We'll have to board
the<i> Enterprise</i>

488
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,667
and take the artifact.

489
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:39,000
Do you have any idea
how many security officers

490
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,750
there are on board
a ship like that?

491
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,792
No, I don't.
But he does.

492
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,458
I could get us
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

493
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,083
I can find the artifact.

494
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:55,166
Oh, yeah.
Very convenient!

495
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:58,083
We beam you back aboard
your old ship.

496
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,500
We have to take a risk that
you won't change your mind

497
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,875
and betray us.

498
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:05,125
I have saved your life
twice already, Galen.

499
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,333
I would think you
would begin to show

500
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,959
some gratitude by now.

501
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:12,208
Galen, if you're so worried
about Riker,

502
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:14,917
then you can go on the
raiding party and watch him.

503
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,083
Agreed.

504
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,500
Draw weapons and equipment
for a raiding party of five.

505
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:30,792
If you're thinking
of betraying us

506
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,959
to your friends
on the<i> Enterprise,</i>

507
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:35,333
you might remember that
I still have the ability

508
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,500
to kill you at the first
sign of trouble.

509
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,417
I haven't forgotten.

510
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:42,583
I have an additional
task for you--

511
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,750
one that will
prove your loyalty.

512
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,625
This raid is an opportunity
to get rid of Galen.

513
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:51,583
Once you've found
that artifact...

514
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,500
kill him.

515
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:05,125
I'm sure the health
and safety inspection

516
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:07,333
won't last much longer.

517
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,291
And in the meantime,
I'm really glad

518
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,667
that we have this opportunity
to get to know you.

519
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:14,417
May I ask what
business you're in?

520
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,917
Lieutenant Worf has programmed
our replicators

521
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:25,041
to make a very good
approximation

522
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,125
of Klingon bloodwine.

523
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:30,667
I believe you will find it
to your liking.

524
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,959
(<i> wine spilling</i> )

525
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,625
Well, that's my third scan

526
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:50,667
and I still haven't found
anything out of the ordinary.

527
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:53,959
He must be hiding
something.

528
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:56,542
We should download his computer
memory and analyze it.

529
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,208
I'd have a hard
time defending that

530
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:00,125
as part of a safety
inspection.

531
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,083
We could claim
that the computer

532
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,375
was generating abnormal
radiation signatures.

533
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,333
Worf, we're on pretty
shaky ground as it is.

534
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,166
We can't just...

535
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:10,792
(<i> groans</i> )

536
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,125
Don't!

537
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:15,458
Watch that door.

538
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:16,667
What is going on?

539
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,208
Shut your mouth,
Klingon!

540
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,458
I guess you're surprised
to see me, Doctor.

541
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:21,625
You could say that.

542
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,041
I've had a change
of profession.

543
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:26,542
It's not in here.
Hey, you.

544
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:28,750
Where's the artifact?

545
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,583
I do not know what
you're talking about.

546
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,375
Use your brain.
They wouldn't be searching

547
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,166
the shuttlecraft if
they had the artifact.

548
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,500
Koral must have it.

549
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,041
Where is that Klingon pilot?

550
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:42,000
In the observation lounge
with Data and Troi.

551
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
How far?

552
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,583
12 decks away.

553
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,500
Security will not allow
you to get that far.

554
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,917
They won't get
the chance.

555
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,792
We'll use the transporter
in that shuttle.

556
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:52,417
We'll beam directly
to the observation lounge.

557
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,417
Sorry about this.

558
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,333
Let's go!

559
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:10,125
If you could tell us...
something about the nature

560
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:11,250
of your mission...

561
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,834
(<i> whoosh of active transport</i> )

562
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,750
What is this?
NARIK: Quiet!

563
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,834
Does he have it?

564
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,250
(<i> beeping</i> )

565
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:36,166
This is it.
Are you sure, Galen?

566
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,166
Yes, I can recognize
the inscription pattern

567
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,959
from the first artifact.

568
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:43,750
Commander Riker...
by taking this action,

569
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,583
you risk charges of assault,
theft, piracy and treason.

570
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,709
Really?
Then I guess adding

571
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:51,583
one more charge wouldn't hurt.

572
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,625
(<i> yells</i> )

573
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:56,792
(<i> gasps</i> )

574
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,500
Is he dead?

575
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:09,000
Yes.

576
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,583
Good.

577
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,000
Activate the transporter.

578
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,625
Security alert.

579
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:24,083
Medical emergency team
to the observation lounge.

580
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,875
Data to Bridge.
Raise shields

581
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,291
and begin sensor sweeps
for the mercenary ship.

582
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,625
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

583
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:34,375
He's all right.
He's only stunned.

584
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,125
I must admit...

585
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:38,458
I am experiencing a
similar sensation.

586
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,125
(<i> groans</i> )

587
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:44,500
This is gonna take a
little time to explain.

588
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:49,709
Set course 310,

589
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:52,250
mark 215.

590
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,166
Warp six.

591
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,166
Where is it?

592
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,166
I have something else
for you, Baran.

593
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:12,125
Tell him
what happened, Narik.

594
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,834
Riker turned on us.

595
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:18,000
He tried to kill Galen
before we beamed back.

596
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,333
PICARD: He might have killed
all of us, and I believe

597
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:23,625
he was acting under your
direct orders, Baran.

598
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,875
You betrayed us.

599
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,709
This has gone
far enough.

600
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:32,542
I think it is time that
we had a new Commander--

601
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:34,417
someone who would lead us
to those profits

602
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,125
that we've been promised.

603
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,333
Oh, really?

604
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,333
And who would that be, Galen?

605
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,834
You?

606
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:47,208
He's plotted
this all along.

607
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:49,750
Opposed me at
every turn.

608
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:52,792
Endangered all of us

609
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:57,125
by refusing to
follow his orders.

610
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:59,208
To follow<i> your</i> orders--

611
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:01,625
the orders of a small
man trying to fill

612
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,250
a role too big for him.

613
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,542
I say it's time for a change.

614
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:08,250
Who's with me?

615
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,792
Hmph.

616
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,458
It's over, Baran.

617
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:26,750
Not quite.

618
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,083
As long as I have this,
I'm still captain of this ship.

619
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,166
You can't kill all of us.

620
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,792
You need us to
run this ship

621
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,667
more than we need
you to command it.

622
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:38,583
I don't have to
kill you all.

623
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,208
Just you, Galen.

624
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,166
(<i> choking</i> )

625
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,875
What happened?

626
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,166
I switched the
transponder codes.

627
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,000
Given his feelings about me,

628
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,542
it seemed a sensible
thing to do.

629
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:16,250
Baran was nothing.

630
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:20,583
We have a mission
to complete,

631
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,875
and the crew
needs a leader.

632
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:33,208
There'll be no more punishment
on board this ship.

633
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,125
Now, do your duties,
and I'll see to it

634
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:39,166
that we complete our mission
and get our payment.

635
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,583
Remove that.

636
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,125
Orders?

637
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:45,834
Maintain our present
course and speed for now.

638
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm gonna find out
when and where

639
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,583
we're supposed to
deliver our cargo.

640
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,542
Aye, Captain.

641
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,583
Worf to Commander Riker.

642
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,458
Minister Satok
of Vulcan Security

643
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:10,333
is standing by on
a secure channel.

644
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,000
Put it through in here.

645
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Greetings, Commander.

646
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,458
How may I be of service?

647
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,041
Minister, I thought
I should let you know

648
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,333
the mercenary ship that has
been raiding planets

649
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:24,083
in the Taugan system is probably
on its way to Vulcan right now.

650
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:26,166
I do not understand.

651
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,750
I'm sorry-- it's been a
difficult couple of days.

652
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,208
I know that one
of your operatives

653
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,750
has been on a mercenary ship
investigating

654
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,458
the possible reassembly
of a psionic resonator.

655
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,125
I didn't want someone
to make a mistake

656
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,917
and start firing at them
when they approach your planet.

657
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:43,583
Commander, I believe
there is a problem.

658
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:47,542
We have no operative
aboard a mercenary ship.

659
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,333
PICARD:
According to Baran's logs

660
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,375
we are to deliver
the two pieces

661
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:58,458
to the T'Karath
Sanctuary on Vulcan.

662
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:00,208
I know that place.

663
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:01,667
It was an underground
stronghold

664
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,458
for one of the factions
during the last civil war.

665
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,542
It's been abandoned
for centuries.

666
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:10,959
Galen to Bridge.
Alter course for Vulcan.

667
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:12,959
VEKOR:
Understood.

668
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:14,625
Oh, I wonder if
you can possibly

669
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:17,375
help me with something.
I have been able to translate

670
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:19,834
most of the writings
on these two pieces.

671
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:22,166
For the most part,
they're warnings of death

672
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:25,125
and destruction to anyone
who opposes the resonator.

673
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,083
But...

674
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:31,000
I am not able to
determine what appears

675
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,083
on the anterior side.
For example...

676
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:37,083
this symbol represents
the Vulcan God of War,

677
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,542
and this, the God of Death.

678
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:42,500
But... if you look
really carefully,

679
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,208
you can see a
third symbol is missing.

680
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:49,250
Now, that obviously should
belong to the final piece.

681
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,792
Now, what's
odd about this

682
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:53,500
is that the God of
Death and War

683
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,709
would typically always
stand alone on an artifact.

684
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:58,959
They'd never be combined
with a third glyph.

685
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,750
Fascinating...

686
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,000
but I am not an
archaeological expert.

687
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,625
I-I'm really anxious
to see the final artifact

688
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,834
because it might provide
a valuable insight

689
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:10,709
into Vulcan mythology.

690
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,875
When we arrive at Vulcan

691
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:16,291
I will take these pieces
to a secure holding area

692
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,875
before going on
to the sanctuary.

693
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,166
I prefer to go alone.

694
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,792
It will arouse
less suspicion

695
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:25,333
on the part of
the isolationists.

696
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,917
Well, there should
be no problem

697
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,375
about our entering orbit.

698
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,792
I asked Commander
Riker to contact

699
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:33,208
the Vulcan authorities
from the<i> Enterprise--</i>

700
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,625
let them know that
we were approaching.

701
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,709
Why did you do that?

702
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:43,125
Well, I... didn't want to
risk a misunderstanding.

703
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,709
Someone might have
mistaken this

704
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:47,750
for an actual raid.

705
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,375
It was a wise precaution.

706
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,542
Perhaps I should contact
the<i> Enterprise...</i>

707
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:58,375
have them meet
us at Vulcan,

708
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:01,750
just in case these
isolationists try to escape.

709
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,125
Your offer<i> is</i> appreciated,

710
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:06,625
but our security forces
are more than adequate.

711
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:11,083
I see. Um...

712
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:14,417
do you think it's wise for
you to go there alone?

713
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:17,750
After all, they were
expecting Baran to show up.

714
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,000
Now, don't you think if
I were to accompany you,

715
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,542
it might seem
more plausible--

716
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:24,375
Captain, I do
understand your human

717
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,875
emotional need to be there
at the final moment.

718
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:30,166
But this is a
Vulcan matter.

719
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,333
Of course.

720
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:36,792
Thank you.

721
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,083
We have entered
orbit of Vulcan.

722
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:51,500
Tallera, I've decided
on a change of plan.

723
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,166
Take one of the
artifacts with you.

724
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,583
Leave the other one here.

725
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:56,625
As soon as we have
our payment in full,

726
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:58,041
we'll complete the delivery.

727
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,583
That was not the agreement.

728
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,583
I realize that.

729
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,959
But it's safer for all concerned
to leave one behind.

730
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:07,208
They will not pay us
until they get<i> both</i> pieces.

731
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,125
They've been waiting
a long time for this.

732
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:11,250
They're not gonna
take any risks.

733
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,875
Now, take one of the
artifacts and beam down.

734
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,375
That is all I was waiting for.

735
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:21,875
Go to the navigational computer
and check file 137/Omega.

736
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,750
You'll find a message
secretly transmitted

737
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,667
to the<i> Enterprise</i> containing
our entire flight plan.

738
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,625
She's right.

739
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:33,291
The message was
sent by Galen.

740
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,500
He's a Starfleet officer.

741
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:41,125
Tallera is right...
but what she's not telling you

742
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,834
is that those artifacts
she's holding

743
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:47,500
are part of an
incredibly powerful weapon.

744
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,792
There's no reward waiting

745
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:50,500
for you down
on the surface.

746
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,125
As soon as she's got
those artifacts,

747
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:56,250
she'll leave you behind to
be captured by Starfleet.

748
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,959
I don't care what it is
you want, Tallera.

749
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:02,000
I don't care if that's a
weapon for your personal use,

750
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,875
or if you're really just making
a delivery as planned.

751
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,709
All I care about is my money.

752
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:09,166
So, I propose
a compromise.

753
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,041
Narik and I will go
with you to the surface

754
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,375
to guarantee that we
receive our payment.

755
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,834
After that, you can go
anywhere you want.

756
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,709
Agreed.

757
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:20,208
Bring him, as well.

758
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,917
We'll use him as a hostage
if Starfleet arrives.

759
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:26,375
If not, we'll kill him
on the surface.

760
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:38,875
There.
Your reward, as promised.

761
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:47,834
NARIK:
Is it all there?

762
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:50,750
No, this is less than half
of what we were promised.

763
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:53,208
Where's the rest of it?

764
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,959
That is all
I could manage.

765
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,750
I suggest you take it
and leave.

766
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,250
I did not come
this far to be cheated.

767
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,250
I want it all now!

768
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,917
Very well.

769
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:07,166
You will get what you deserve.

770
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,208
(<i> screams</i> )

771
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,542
(<i> shrieks</i> )

772
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,166
Go ahead, Captain.
Pick up the phaser.

773
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:34,250
See what good it will do.

774
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,750
You'll never get
away with this.

775
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,208
Starfleet will never stand by
and watch you tear apart

776
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:41,291
one of the founding
worlds of the Federation.

777
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:45,458
How little you understand what
you're facing, Captain.

778
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,959
You're used to fighting
enemies like yourself--

779
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:51,917
people on ships
with defense shields,

780
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:53,500
energy weapons,
warp drives.

781
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,959
But this is unlike
anything you've ever faced.

782
00:39:57,959 --> 00:40:01,583
This is the power
of the mind.

783
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,166
Pick up the phaser, Captain.

784
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,166
PICARD:
Listen to me, all of you.

785
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:14,250
Drop your weapons!
Do it!

786
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,750
Don't make any
aggressive movements.

787
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,000
The resonator amplifies

788
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,083
violent feelings
and emotions.

789
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:30,375
And that's why you wanted me
to pick up the phaser.

790
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:33,417
That's how you were able
to kill Narik and Vekor.

791
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:38,041
But I can see the symbol
on that third artifact...

792
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:42,041
and it is the Vulcan
symbol for peace

793
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:46,625
standing between the
symbols for war and death.

794
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:50,125
It's a warning that the
power of the resonator

795
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:51,625
can be overcome
by peace.

796
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:55,208
You are about to see
how wrong you are.

797
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,625
Empty your minds
of violent thoughts!

798
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:11,667
No!

799
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:16,041
Think, Tallera.
2,000 years ago

800
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,417
your people were
being consumed by war.

801
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:20,166
But when peace
came to Vulcan,

802
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:23,750
the resonator
became useless.

803
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,083
That's why it was dismantled.

804
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,375
(<i> grunts</i> )

805
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:48,542
Oh...

806
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:50,000
You were right, Tallera.

807
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,917
The resonator
cannot be stopped

808
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:54,792
by phasers
and shields.

809
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:57,667
But it can be
defeated by peace.

810
00:42:05,709 --> 00:42:07,375
(<i> whimpers</i> )

811
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:21,750
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47169.2.</i>

812
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,291
<i>Security Minister Satok</i>
<i>has taken Tallera into custody</i>

813
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:29,083
<i>and begun a search for the rest</i>
<i>of the isolationists.</i>

814
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,792
Once we realized that
you were no longer

815
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:33,500
on the mercenary ship,
we scanned the surface

816
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,083
for your neural implant.

817
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:37,667
We tracked the signal
into the caverns.

818
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,542
What will become of
the resonator, sir?

819
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:40,875
Satok has assured me

820
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:43,000
that all three pieces
will be destroyed.

821
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,041
It is unfortunate
it cannot be studied.

822
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:46,667
The resonator is
a key artifact

823
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,250
from a remarkable
period of history.

824
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,291
Oh, normally, I would be
the first one to agree.

825
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:55,291
But perhaps some things
are best left in the past.

826
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:56,834
What's going to happen to the
mercenaries?

827
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:58,208
Oh, they will be detained

828
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,250
by the Vulcan authorities
for the moment.

829
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,417
(<i> yawning</i> )
But they're also facing

830
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:05,250
charges from the Klingons,
the Cardassians,

831
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,542
the Ferengi, and at least
seven other worlds.

832
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:09,875
I don't think we'll be
hearing from them for a while.

833
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:12,917
Number One, will you set
a course for Starbase 227?

834
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:14,709
I'll join you on
the Bridge shortly.

835
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:17,500
Wait a minute.
You've been declared dead.

836
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,083
You can't give orders
around here.

837
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:21,875
DATA: If we are to
adhere to the exact letter

838
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:25,041
of Starfleet regulations,
then technically, sir,

839
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:27,208
you have been
declared a renegade.

840
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,417
In fact, I believe
you are facing

841
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:32,041
12 counts of
court-martial offenses.

842
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:34,041
You cannot give orders
either, sir.

843
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:36,083
That's quite right.

844
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:39,959
And as I am supposed to be dead,
I'll go and get some sleep.

845
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:41,500
And Mr. Data,

846
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,291
I suggest that you escort
Commander Riker to the brig.

847
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,291
Aye, sir.

848
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,917
(<i> chuckles</i> )

849
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,166
This way, sir.

850
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:54,458
Data, he was joking.

851
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:57,834
You know that, right?

852
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:00,166
Data?
