RIKER:
That's the<i> Brattain,</i> all right.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,375
The ship
is intact, sir.

13
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:29,250
with no indication
of structural damage.

14
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,709
Engines?

All propulsion
systems are shut down.

16
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,417
The ship

17
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,750
Life-form readings?

18
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:37,750
DATA:
Inconclusive.

19
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,625
Counselor?

20
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,917
There is life
on board, but...

21
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,000
What is it?

22
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,625
I don't know.

23
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,750
Something...

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
Number One,
assemble your team.

25
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,083
Dr. Crusher, report
to transporter room three.

26
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,083
Worf. Data.

27
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,709
Commander...

28
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,291
I need to come too.

29
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:32,458
There is no malfunction
in any of the main systems, sir.

30
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:49,250
WORF:
Commander.

31
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,291
Here's another one.

32
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,709
This was done
by a phaser

33
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,083
on a setting of
six or seven.

34
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,959
And more over here.

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,333
The entire
bridge crew.

36
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,875
Whoever did this
could still be on the ship.

37
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:11,500
TROI:
There is someone
still alive,

38
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:14,083
but he didn't kill
these people.

39
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,625
Here.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,458
I think he's Betazoid.

41
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,083
It's all right.
We're going to help you.

42
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,542
(<i> inhales sharply</i> )

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,417
Who did this?

44
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,667
Who did this to you?

45
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:09,000
(Captain Jean-Luc Picard)
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

46
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:13,458
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,959
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,667
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

49
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:23,291
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

50
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:27,291
<i>to boldly go where</i>
<i>no one has gone before.</i>

51
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:33,375
CRUSHER:
We've almost finished
the autopsies, Captain.

52
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:35,166
How long will it take
to compile the data?

53
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,458
It's complicated.

54
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,709
The dead were found
all over the ship.

55
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,041
Some were found locked
in their rooms,

56
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,625
barricaded with weapons
piled all around them.

57
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,166
Others were found
in the corridors,

58
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,875
where they'd obviously
had hand-to-hand combat.

59
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:50,208
It's going
to take some time

60
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,583
to analyze and sort
through the details.

61
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:54,750
We've identified him

62
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:57,208
as Andrus Hagan
from Betazed.

63
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,375
Scientific advisor.

64
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:02,792
He's in a profound
catatonic state.

65
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,917
I'm not getting much, Captain.

66
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,250
A few words,
disconnected phrases.

67
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,709
I can feel his terror,

68
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,125
but I can't seem
to get through to him.

69
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,917
Stay with him,
Counselor.

70
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,458
We're examining the<i> Brattain</i>
for clues, but...

71
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,000
this is the only man left
who knows what happened there.

72
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,917
TROI:
<i>I'm here.</i>

73
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,458
<i>I'm right here.</i>

74
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,291
HAGAN:
<i>Out there...</i>

75
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,583
<i>voices...</i>

76
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,625
<i>Voices?</i>
<i>What do they say?</i>

77
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,625
<i>Both things...</i>

78
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:45,250
<i>No... no...</i>

79
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,333
<i>Keep talking to me.</i>

80
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,875
<i>I'll try</i>
<i>to understand.</i>

81
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,875
All the engines check out
perfectly, Commander.

82
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:03,875
Once we get them started,
the<i> Brattain</i> can get back

83
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,792
to starbase
under her own power.

84
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,750
Let's give it
a try.

85
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,083
Pre-heating injectors.

86
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,583
Data, fuel flow?

87
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:16,208
Matter valves are open
and operating.

88
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,709
Magnetic containment

89
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,709
of antimatter pods
is constant.

90
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,875
Okay, open injectors.

91
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,500
Injectors open.

92
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,375
There is no engine
activity at all, sir.

93
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,125
What's wrong?

94
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,875
Nothing's wrong.

95
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,959
I don't understand it.

96
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,041
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come.

97
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,417
I've been studying
the autopsy reports.

98
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,875
The conclusion
is appalling.

99
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,500
There was
no outside source,

100
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,000
no alien presence.

101
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:58,792
All 34 of them appear
to have killed each other.

102
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,000
What could have caused
such an event?

103
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,458
Drugs?

104
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,000
A virus? Poison?
Toxicological tests

105
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,375
showed no unusual substances
in their systems.

106
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:10,041
And they all appear
to be in good health,

107
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,583
but for whatever reason

108
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,583
they seemed to turn
against each other,

109
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:18,083
using phasers and knives
and bare hands.

110
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,625
I'd like you
to see this, Captain.

111
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,750
It's from the logs
of the<i> Brattain.</i>

112
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,041
Captain Zaheva's
mental condition

113
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,458
deteriorated steadily

114
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,542
once they had
become stranded.

115
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,959
She began talking
of plots and mutinies.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,291
This was the last
entry in the log,

117
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,875
made after they had been
adrift for over three weeks.

118
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,000
First Officer Brink
and his men were behind it.

119
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:46,709
They got to the engines.

120
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,542
They don't work
anymore.

121
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,500
Had to eliminate Brink.

122
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:56,250
The ship is out of...
out of...

123
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,709
We're running out...

124
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,125
too dangerous...

125
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,959
out of Brink...

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,875
and his men!

I'm gonna try...

150
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,959
recalibrating
the field generators.

151
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,750
I still don't see

152
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,208
why we can't get
the engine started.

153
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,250
It just...
doesn't make any sense.

I mean, I...
thought I heard something.

164
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,792
The ship was searched

There's nobody left

166
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,500
Sorry, sir, my mistake.

167
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't worry about it.
There were 34 people

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,625
I'm doing
an isozyme study

181
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,250
on some populations
of Cardilia,

182
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,500
but they're turning out
to have

183
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:38,250
these really weird
polymorphisms.

184
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,458
(<i> sighs</i> )
What a headache.

185
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,375
Is that why
you're late?

186
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, no, I had a conference
with Dr. Balthus.

187
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,041
She wants to do a study
on the laticifer ontogeny

188
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,583
of the Kaladian
thorn flower.

189
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,750
But I don't have time
to oversee another project.

190
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,583
Was Tom Corbin
there?

191
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,750
What?

192
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:58,333
Tom Corbin,
from the science lab.

193
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,583
Remember him?

194
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,041
Of course I remember
him, but--

195
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,375
You use any excuse you can
to pay him a visit.

196
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:05,667
Miles, what are
you saying?

197
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:07,834
I think you know exactly
what I'm saying.

198
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,500
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were jealous.

199
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,709
Do you take me
for a fool?

200
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:29,917
Hello, Chief.

201
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,834
Having coffee?

202
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,375
No, I'm drinking
too much coffee.

203
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,166
Kind of a surprise
to see you here at this hour.

204
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,875
Yeah, why is that?

205
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,500
You're not out
of the honeymoon yet.

206
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:40,750
Usually newlyweds
can't keep

207
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,000
their hands off
each other.

208
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,792
She has work to do.

209
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:46,250
She heads up the plant
biology lab, you know?

210
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,291
Any strange things
going on down there?

211
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,542
Like what?

212
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,166
I've been hearing things.

213
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,083
Kenicki,
in Engineering,

214
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,417
told me he saw a man
in an old Starfleet uniform

215
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,834
riding the lift
near the engine core.

216
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,291
When the lift got to the top,
there was no one on it.

217
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,458
Ghost stories?

218
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,291
There's more.
There's lots more.

219
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,125
There are strange things
happening on this ship, O'Brien.

220
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,959
I'm surprised at you,
Gillespie--

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
a Starfleet officer?

222
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,667
I have more things
to worry about

223
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:20,333
than shades
and spirits.

224
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,166
(<i> door chimes</i> )

225
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,709
Come.

226
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:35,000
(<i> door chimes</i> )

227
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,250
Come!

228
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

229
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:44,792
(<i> door chimes</i> )

230
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:46,709
Yes, yes.

231
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,667
(<i> door chimes</i> )

232
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

233
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:11,875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

234
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:16,208
(<i> knocking</i> )

235
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,458
Come?

236
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,458
What..?

237
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,583
Captain, do you have
a moment?

238
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,333
We're concerned.
We're afraid

239
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,667
whatever happened
on the<i> Brattain</i>

240
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,834
may be
starting here.
Explain.

241
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:36,333
Well, Beverly and I have
been getting unusual reports.

242
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,291
People behaving
strangely.

243
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,583
Others hearing sounds
that aren't there.

244
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,625
Are we talking
about hallucinations?

245
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,542
In some cases, in others
just erratic behavior.

246
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:49,125
We can't track down any element
that might be responsible.

247
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,625
But everything started
when we found the<i> Brattain.</i>

248
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,500
Yes. Captain,

249
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:56,542
we have to get
the<i> Enterprise</i> away from here

250
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,709
before it gets any worse.

251
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,041
We're preparing to take
the<i> Brattain</i> in tow.

252
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,083
We'll be on our way
within the hour.

253
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:12,792
PICARD:
Ensign, maneuver us
into tractor beam range.

254
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,291
Aye, sir.

255
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,917
Is there
a problem, Ensign?

256
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:25,834
I... can't seem
to remember

257
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,458
how to enter
the coordinates, sir.

258
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,875
Ensign Lin.

259
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:30,417
Ready now, Captain.

260
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,583
Report to sick bay,
Ensign Rager.

261
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,291
PICARD:
Ready tractor beam,
Mr. Worf.

262
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,417
Captain, thrusters
are losing power.

263
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:44,041
Impulse engines--
ahead minimum power.

264
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,333
Impulse engines are
not responding, sir.

265
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,041
Geordi, what's going on
down there?

266
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,750
LA FORGE:
I don't know, sir.
Nothing's responding.

267
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,875
Go to warp engines,
factor one.

268
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,417
Engage.

269
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,375
Captain, we don't have
warp drive, either.

270
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,542
We have no functional
propulsion systems?

271
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,625
No, sir.

272
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,041
Apparently,
we do not.

273
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,375
We're adrift.

274
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,542
Just like
the<i> Brattain.</i>

275
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:18,959
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44639.9.</i>

276
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,583
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has now been</i>
<i>adrift for a total of ten days.</i>

277
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,792
<i>We have sent subspace</i>
<i>distress calls,</i>

278
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,750
<i>but, because</i>
<i>of our distant location,</i>

279
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:30,375
<i>we cannot expect a response</i>
<i>for at least another two weeks.</i>

280
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:32,709
After analyzing
the sensor logs

281
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,917
of the<i> Brattain</i>
and the<i> Enterprise</i>

282
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,125
as well as the data

283
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,041
from the last series
of probes,

284
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,792
I conclude that
we have become trapped

285
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,667
in a massive
rupture in space

286
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,625
into which energy
is absorbed.

287
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:46,542
You mean
a Tyken's Rift.

288
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,917
A what?

289
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,458
A rare anomaly named
after Bela Tyken,

290
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,125
a Melthusian captain
who first encountered it.

291
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,792
Tyken's Rift.

292
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:57,000
That would explain why
we don't have engine power.

293
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,875
The ship's energy is
being drained

294
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,959
into the fissure
before we can utilize it.

295
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,500
I was detained.

296
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,500
DATA:
When Tyken was
trapped in the rift,

297
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:14,959
his analysis determined
that a massive energy release

298
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,959
might overload and dislocate
the anomaly.

299
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,166
Fortunately, his cargo
included anicium and yurium,

300
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,000
which he used to detonate
the explosion.

301
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,959
He then escaped through
the ruptured center of the rift.

302
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,375
But we aren't
carrying anything

303
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:30,041
that could produce
that kind of an explosion.

304
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,208
Not even our photon torpedoes
would be enough.

305
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,542
Couldn't we replicate
the elements Tyken used?

306
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,041
No, sir, we no longer have
the power to reproduce

307
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,834
complex elements
in the replicator.

308
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:43,041
We must find a way to generate
a violent energy release

309
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,208
without using
conventional means.

310
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,083
Data, in Tyken's
experience,

311
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,542
did the crew exhibit
behavioral changes?

312
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:54,083
No. There were no reports of
unusual conduct among the crew.

313
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,542
What about nightmares?

314
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,625
There were no records
of sleep disturbances

315
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:58,959
of any kind,
Counselor.

316
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,333
Then... what is it?

317
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,917
What's happening to us?

318
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,667
The only one who
doesn't seem affected

319
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:11,750
by all this is Data.

320
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,125
Bridge.

321
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,792
Number One,
how are...

322
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,083
Sir?

323
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,250
Any hallucinations?

324
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,500
Nightmares?

325
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,000
No...

326
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,250
but I'd be a liar if I said
I felt like myself.

327
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,500
I've had
to bite my tongue

328
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,208
to keep from
snapping at people.

329
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,250
Couple of times,
I've...

330
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,291
gone to my quarters
and felt as if there was

331
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,542
someone else in there, waiting
for me.

332
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,041
I've had
similar feelings.

333
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,917
With everyone
succumbing,

334
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,500
it's even more important
that one of us attempt

335
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,875
to keep control
of his faculties.

336
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,500
I want you to turn in--
take a nap.

337
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll be on the bridge.

338
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,375
You can relieve me
in four hours.

339
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,166
Yes, sir.

340
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,041
Deck eight.

341
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:14,625
No!

342
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,709
Sir?

343
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,166
As you were.

344
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:49,875
Mr. Data, will you join me
in my ready room?

345
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:28,291
(<i> snakes hissing</i> )

346
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,083
Commander La Forge
and I have come up with

347
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,375
a potential solution
to our predicament.

348
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:45,166
Perhaps the modifications
used to increase firepower

349
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,333
against the Borg
would be effective here.

350
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:52,250
Channeling power
to the main...

351
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,917
um... deflector dish.

352
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:57,792
Yes, sir. I believe
that within six hours

353
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:59,709
we could generate
a concentrated

354
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,208
burst of energy which might
disrupt the Tyken's Rift.

355
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,208
Very well.
Proceed.

356
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,250
Mr. Data.

357
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,542
Yes, sir?

358
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,375
It appears
that I am not...

359
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:18,458
immune to the strange forces
that are at work on this ship.

360
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,333
Yes, sir.

361
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:25,083
It's a terrifying prospect--
to lose control of one's mind.

362
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,750
When I was young...

363
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:35,125
I remember watching
my grandfather deteriorate

364
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:38,333
from a powerful,
intelligent figure

365
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:42,875
to a frail wisp of a man

366
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:45,709
who could barely
make his own way home.

367
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,792
Mr. Data, it is
my responsibility...

368
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:55,208
somehow-- to see that
this ship is guided to safety.

369
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:00,041
I will need to rely on you
from now on.

370
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:06,125
We may need to count on you
for our very survival.

371
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,709
I will do
my best, sir.

372
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:14,500
I'd like to do
more cross-sections

373
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,875
on the brain tissue
of some of these bodies.

374
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:19,667
Set up the positron
emission sensor in sick bay,

375
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,542
and I'll decide which ones
I want to study.

376
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,667
Yes, Doctor.

377
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,583
(<i> rustling sound</i> )

378
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,375
Go away.

379
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:38,000
CRUSHER:
Captain, let me
ask you this--

380
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,166
since we located
the<i> Brattain,</i>

381
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:43,458
can you remember
any of your dreams?

382
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,208
I hardly ever
recall dreams.

383
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,333
Most people don't,
but think--

384
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:53,709
have you even<i> had</i> a dream
in the last ten days?

385
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,333
I don't recall.

386
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,208
I'm willing to bet
you haven't.

387
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,583
What's more,
neither has anyone else

388
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,834
onboard this ship,
except for Troi.

389
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,458
I began to realize that

390
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,208
when she talked about
having nightmares.

391
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:16,667
I've done some...

392
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:19,041
additional
brain tissue scans

393
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,583
on the bodies...

394
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:24,500
some of the bodies
from the, uh... the...

395
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:25,750
The<i> Brattain,</i> Doctor.

396
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,333
Right, and I've
also done some scans

397
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,667
on a random cross-section
from our crew.

398
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:33,792
They both have
the same results--

399
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:36,583
a unique chemical
imbalance.

400
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,125
Caused by?

401
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:40,625
Dream deprivation.

402
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,500
Every night,

403
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,750
when we...

404
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:48,709
we...

405
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,625
enter into...

406
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:52,583
sleep...

407
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:56,417
I believe what
the doctor means

408
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:59,959
is that humans enter into
what is known

409
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,709
as R.E.M. sleep--
rapid eye movement.

410
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,709
It is the level

411
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,917
of brain-wave activity

412
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:07,208
at which one dreams.

413
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,625
We have to dream
in order to survive.

414
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,834
If we don't reach
R.E.M. sleep,

415
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,875
we don't dream, we...

416
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:17,291
we begin to lose
our cognitive abilities.

417
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,458
We find it hard
to concentrate.

418
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,750
We forget how to do
the most ordinary task.

419
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:27,125
Then we become
irritable, paranoid.

420
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:30,542
Some people experience
hallucinations.

421
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:33,959
You're describing
the situation on this ship,

422
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,792
but counselor Troi
reported nightmares.

423
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,458
Maybe it's because
she's betazoid.

424
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,792
I don't know why.

425
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,375
All I know is that
there's more going on here

426
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,959
than being caught
in a Tyken's Rift,

427
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,458
and I don't know how
or why it's happening,

428
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,291
but I do know this.

429
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:58,041
There is an inevitable
conclusion to this pattern,

430
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,375
and if I can't find
a way to stop it,

431
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:04,542
we will all go insane.

432
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,750
SIGHING VOICE:
<i>Eyes... in the dark.</i>

433
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,000
<i>One moon circles...</i>

434
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:33,208
Where are you?!

435
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,375
SIGHING VOICE:
<i>Eyes... in the dark.</i>

436
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:39,542
<i>One moon circles...</i>

437
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,709
TROI:
<i>I'm still here.</i>

438
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,000
<i>I haven't gone anywhere.</i>

439
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,083
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>anything more?</i>

440
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,625
<i>Double...</i>

441
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,291
<i>double...</i>

442
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,458
<i>What does that mean?</i>

443
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,083
<i>Is something doubled?</i>

444
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:28,417
Deanna,
nothing's working.

445
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,000
I've tried somatic drugs.

446
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,333
I've tried
inducing theta waves

447
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,625
into the entorhinal cortex.

448
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,417
No matter what I do,

449
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,542
no one can reach
R.E.M. sleep.

450
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,709
No one can dream...

451
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,875
except for you.

452
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,000
Except me...

453
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:53,709
and all I have
is nightmares.

454
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,750
I can hardly sleep
at all anymore.

455
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:02,750
In the end,
I'll be like him.

456
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,917
Just like him.

457
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:10,250
GILLESPIE:
Well, I think it's
some kind of experiment.

458
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,417
See, Captain Picard
is trying to see

459
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:16,291
how long we'll take it--
stuck here like rats.

460
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,959
Oh, you couldn't be
more wrong.

461
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,166
It's like we're
laboratory animals.

462
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:22,917
I don't wanna
sit here and wait

463
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:25,625
for death
to sneak up behind me.

464
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:27,625
What's that
supposed to mean?

465
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:29,667
You heard about them
on the<i> Brattain--</i>

466
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:31,250
shut in their rooms,
dying alone.

467
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,709
That's not for me.

468
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,291
I'd rather
go out fighting.

469
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:43,041
Okay, all power
has been channeled

470
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:44,667
to the, um...

471
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:45,959
the...

472
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,208
The main
deflector dish.

473
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,000
Yes, right,
the deflector dish.

474
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:52,375
(<i> sighing</i> )

475
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:55,417
So, uh...

476
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,166
what do we do now?

477
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,458
Data to bridge.

478
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,583
Mr. Worf,
activate the deflector.

479
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:02,959
WORF:
Aye, sir.

480
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:08,375
Deflector power banks
approaching maximum.

481
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:10,667
Discharge
in 15 seconds.

482
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,834
Data, this detonation
better work.

483
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,875
We're not going
to last much longer.

484
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,208
Discharge in three seconds.

485
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,709
Two, one.

486
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,250
Nothing.
It just fizzled out.

487
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,625
DATA:
Captain, it appears
the energy output

488
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:32,625
has been absorbed
into the rift.

489
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,417
PICARD:
Data, can we try again?

490
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,959
No, sir,
if we draw more power

491
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,875
we risk losing
life-support systems.

492
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:41,667
PICARD:
Understood. Keep me
apprised, Commander.

493
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,959
<i>Lujpu'...</i>

494
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,166

496
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,041
Worf, no!

497
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,917
You will not stop me.

498
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,417
Security, Worf's
quarters immediately.

499
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,667
No one can stop me.
Why?

500
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:40,291
What is it?

501
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:50,083
I am no longer
a warrior.

502
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:53,250
I am no longer strong.

503
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,458
I... I feel...

504
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,083
What?

505
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:04,583
What do you feel?

506
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,750
I feel fear.

507
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,709
To admit that
you are afraid

508
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,709
gives you strength.

509
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,792
Something is
waiting for us.

510
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:22,709
I am not strong enough
to fight it.

511
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,166
No, Worf.

512
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,208
It's just an illusion.

513
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,500
It's not real.

514
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,667
Please,

515
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:36,208
put down the knife.

516
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,917
Counselor?

517
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:53,208
It's all right.

518
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,583
Everything's fine.

519
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,125
Thank you.

520
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,458

00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:09,000
<i>What do you mean?</i>

535
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:11,000
You<i> can't leave?</i>

536
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,959
<i>No, no.</i>

537
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,458
<i>Please... can't.</i>

538
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,083
<i>You want to leave.</i>

539
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,959
<i>Why can't you?</i>

540
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,542
<i>Can't go.</i>

541
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,250
<i>Help.</i>

542
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:26,250
<i>One moon...</i>
<i>circling.</i>

543
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,208
<i>Eyes...</i>

544
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,208
<i>that's it...</i>

545
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,166
<i>eyes...</i>

546
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,583
<i>in the dark.</i>

547
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,417
"Eyes in the dark."

548
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,125
That's what the voice said
in my dream.

549
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,542
Is that where
you heard it?

550
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:52,458
In a dream?
Over and over?

551
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:02,542
Beverly,
I know what it is.

552
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,959
I know what's happening.

553
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,083
What?

554
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,500
My nightmare.
It's not a dream!

555
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:11,500
It's not a dream at all,
it's a message.

556
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,125
R.E.M. sleep occurs
at a different frequency

557
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:17,208
for betazoids than
for other humanoids.

558
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,750
I believe the beings

559
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:22,291
are using
that frequency to...

560
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,583
communicate
telepathically.

561
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,792
DATA:
It is possible that this
telepathic communication

562
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,041
is creating interference
in the R.E.M. sleep

563
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,291
of other species

564
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,166
That would explain
why the rest of our crew

565
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,959
is not dreaming.

566
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,417
Counselor, what are these...

567
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,875
beings trying to tell us?

568
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:40,500
They're calling for help.

569
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:43,542
I think they're trapped,
just like we are.

570
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,458
"Eyes in the dark"

571
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,583
could mean
this twin star system.

572
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:51,375
Your hypothesis is
certainly plausible.

573
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:56,041
There may be
another ship...

574
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,709
on the other side
of the fissure

575
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,250
where we cannot
detect it.

576
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:03,417
Is there a way we could
block their signals?

577
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:04,959
There is no technology

578
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,250
to block telepathic
transmissions, Doctor.

579
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,333
Maybe communication
through dreams

580
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:13,083
can work both ways.

581
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:15,875
I could try
and get them to stop.

582
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:18,917
Perhaps we could
accomplish more than that.

583
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,792
If there is another ship,

584
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,834
and we can reach them,

585
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,583
we might be able to coordinate
our efforts to free ourselves.

586
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:28,500
It is conceivable.

587
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:32,375
When working with patients
with debilitating nightmares,

588
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:35,000
I've often used
a therapeutic treatment

589
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,917
called directed
dreaming.

590
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:40,500
Dreamers can learn
to control their dreams,

591
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:42,917
retain a conscious
memory,

592
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:46,166
even while
in R.E.M. sleep.

593
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,208
I could remember
a short message

594
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,792
and deliver it to them.

595
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,458
If it were possible,
what would you say?

596
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,000
DATA:
Working together
with the aliens,

597
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,041
we must discover
a means by which

598
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,709
we can produce
an explosion

599
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,291
more intense than
either one of us

600
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,166
could achieve alone.

601
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,291
What is it you're
looking for?

602
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,834
DATA:
These are the elements
we have available.

603
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,709
Some of them could be
used in the creation

604
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,500
of an explosive
reaction.

605
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:18,166
If we could communicate this
inventory to the other ship,

606
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,375
perhaps they would
be able to--

607
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:21,417
No, Data, no.

608
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:23,125
This is too complex.

609
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:27,041
It has to be a simple,
clear message.

610
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,083
I am uncertain
if a simple transmission

611
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,291
would be adequate.

612
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,875
Stop.

613
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:36,542
Go back.

614
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:37,875
Further back...

615
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:40,083
There. Stop.

616
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:42,500
"One moon circles."

617
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:44,125
Yes, Counselor.

618
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:46,542
One electron
circles one proton.

619
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,917
This is
a hydrogen atom.

620
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:52,458
"One moon circles."
That's what they've been

621
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,917
telling me,
over and over.

622
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:56,000
Perhaps the aliens are
thinking as we are--

623
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,000
to collaborate in
producing an explosion.

624
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:01,709
If hydrogen is combined
with another element--

625
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,125
calendenium, for example--
it is extremely volatile.

626
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:10,125
But would the message mean
that they<i> have</i> hydrogen

627
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,667
or they<i> want</i> hydrogen?

628
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:13,959
Well, if it's
a distress call,

629
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,333
I think they'd be asking
for what they need,

630
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,333
not what
they already have.

631
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,041
Then the proper course
of action would be

632
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:22,583
to release hydrogen
into the rift and hope

633
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,792
they have a substance
that would detonate it.

634
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,417
How do I tell them
what to do?

635
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,625
If you are correct,
Counselor,

636
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:34,208
I believe they have
already told<i> us</i> what to do

637
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,291
and are waiting
for us to do it.

638
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:38,542
When we are ready,
the only message

639
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:42,208
you should attempt
to convey is "now."

640
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:47,542
I can help keep you
in R.E.M. sleep for a while

641
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:50,834
with this
cortical scanner.

642
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:53,792
It will maintain
electrical activity

643
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,667
in your brain
at the proper frequency.

644
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:06,333
Counselor, you will
have to communicate

645
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,166
with the other ship
within two minutes

646
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:10,000
of entering
R.E.M. sleep.

647
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,709
TROI:
Two minutes?

648
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,542
Is that all, Data?

649
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:16,125
Unfortunately, yes.
We have only enough power

650
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,959
to emit a hydrogen stream for
that amount of time.

651
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,542
They must understand
that they will have

652
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,166
to detonate it
immediately.

653
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:25,792
Captain, we are ready
to implement the plan.

654
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:28,417
Proceed.

655
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:31,250
We will have to draw power
from the life-support systems

656
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:34,458
in order to discharge
the collectors.

657
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,333
This is
Acting Captain Data.

658
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,208
All personnel will report

659
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,583
to the designated
shelter areas immediately.

660
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,458
Life-support systems
will continue

661
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,709
only in emergency shelter areas.

662
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,583
You hear that?

663
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:57,208
Get us jammed
into shelter areas.

664
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,166
We sit and wait to die.

665
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,625
Nobody'll ever find us.

666
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:04,583
Relax, Gillespie.
Everybody relax.

667
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,834
Ten forward is
a designated shelter area.

668
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,875
Relax.

669
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:13,458
Do we want to die here,
like helpless children?

670
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,959
Security to Ten Forward
immediately.

671
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,709
We don't even know
what we're dying for.

672
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,166
Sit down, Gillespie, you're
not helping matters anyhow.

673
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,333
What's wrong with
standing up for ourselves?

674
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,208
MAN:
Yeah.

675
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,125
Picard owes us
some answers.

676
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:38,917
(<i> beam whirs, sizzles</i> )

677
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,417
What is that?

678
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:46,542
This is a little souvenir
I picked up from Magus Three.

679
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,250
That was setting
number one.

680
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:50,542
Anyone wanna see
setting number two?

681
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:57,250
P.G.O. signals steady.

682
00:40:57,291 --> 00:41:00,625
Visual cortex showing
increased activity.

683
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,625
Rapid eye movements
commencing.

684
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,250
Crusher to bridge.

685
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:14,375
She's in R.E.M. sleep.

686
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:16,375
Thank you, Doctor.

687
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:18,750
Activating
bussard collectors.

688
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,917
SIGHING VOICE:
<i>Eyes... in the dark.</i>

689
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:35,917
Where are you?

690
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:40,792
90 seconds remaining.

691
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:45,125
<i>One moon... circles...</i>

692
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:48,166
Where are you?

693
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,959
I have to find you!

694
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,500
I have to tell you.

695
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,166
45 seconds remaining.

696
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:07,041
<i>One moon...</i>

697
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:09,125
Please...
<i>Circles...</i>

698
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:12,291
I must find you...

699
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:15,333
to tell you.

700
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:17,458
30 seconds remaining.

701
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,125
Ten seconds remaining.

702
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,458
Nothing.

703
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,125
No explosion.

704
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:46,500
The counselor was
unsuccessful.

705
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:55,125
Activate
impulse engines.

706
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:57,166
Engines activated, sir.

707
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:29,875
We have cleared
the rift, sir.

708
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:34,208
Warp engines are
coming back online.

709
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,250
Set a course to...

710
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:40,166
Setting a course
for Starbase 220.

711
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,917
Sir,

712
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:53,125
as my final duty
as Acting Captain,

713
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:54,959
I order you to bed.
