00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:07,125
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45376.3.</i>

2
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:09,208
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>the planet Bilana III</i>

3
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,000
<i>where a new method</i>
<i>of propulsion</i>

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,959
<i>known as the "soliton wave"</i>
<i>is being developed.</i>

5
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:15,458
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has been asked</i>

6
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,375
<i>to participate</i>
<i>in one of the first tests</i>

7
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,000
<i>of this new technology.</i>

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,542
Data.

9
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:24,208
Data, isn't this exciting?

10
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,834
We are going to witness
a moment in history.

11
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:29,625
Every nanosecond
in this continuum

12
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,875
is a moment in history
once it has elapsed.

13
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,000
No, no, no.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,291
I mean we are going
to see something

15
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,875
that people will talk about
for years.

16
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,166
I mean, think about it

17
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,750
no more bulky warp engines
or nacelles.

18
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,750
A ship just generates
a soliton wave

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,208
and then rides it
through space

20
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,250
like a surfboard.

21
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,917
This is going to be like
being there

22
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:50,417
to watch Chuck Yeager
break the sound barrier

23
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:54,000
or Zefram Cochrane
engage the first warp drive.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,500
It should be interesting.

25
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,542
Very exciting.

26
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,291
I'm talking
to the wrong crowd.

27
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,458
Donaldson.

28
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,458
Donaldson, you're
an engineer.

29
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,000
OFFICER:
Lieutenant Worf, you have
a subspace communication

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,959
from the transport ship<i> Milan.</i>

31
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,917
Transfer the signal
to this station.

32
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,291
Hello, Worf.

33
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,417
Mother.

34
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:20,667
I hope you don't mind us
dropping in on you like this

35
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:24,333
but when I heard the<i> Enterprise</i>
was to be in this sector

36
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,583
we took the first transport,
and here we are.

37
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,917
Is Father with you?

38
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:32,250
No, but I-I-I brought
Alexander with me.

39
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,041
I thought the two of you
would like the chance to visit.

40
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,917
Very well. I will make
arrangements

41
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:39,834
for you to come aboard.

42
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:41,041
Good.

43
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:50,291
Worf.

44
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,834
Worf.

45
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,208
It's so good to see you.

46
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,750
You look wonderful.

47
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,709
Is that a touch of
gray in your beard?

48
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,166
Don't worry.

49
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,000
The Rozhenko men have always
had beards of iron gray.

50
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,250
Hello, Alexander.

51
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,250
Hello.

52
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:23,375
It's good to see you both.

53
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,583
How long can you stay?

54
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,375
I'm not going back.

55
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:07,500
PICARD:
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

56
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,667
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

57
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,458
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

58
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,208
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

59
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:21,500
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

60
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,333
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

61
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,750
Did you see the look
on Alexander's face

62
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,667
when he saw the play area?

63
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,917
He's going to love it here.

64
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:43,500
Mother, why does Alexander
believe he is remaining?

65
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,792
Lapsang souchong tea, please.

66
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:49,792
Are you eating?

67
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:50,834
You look thin.

68
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:51,875
Mother.

69
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,333
When your father
was in Starfleet

70
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,333
I always had to make
sure that I was...

71
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,667
Mother

72
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,417
we need to talk
about Alexander.

73
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,834
Alexander is a,
is a fine boy, Worf.

74
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:13,834
He's, he's smart and
he's high-spirited--

75
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:15,917
a lot like you
were at that age.

76
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:18,583
And sometimes, when he comes
running through the house

77
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,458
and he knocks over
that big green lamp

78
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,083
just like you used to do.

79
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,542
Well, I don't
remember you smiling

80
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,542
when I knocked over
that lamp.

81
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,667
Well, maybe once...

82
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:32,625
when you
weren't looking.

83
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,625
When we learned Alexander
was to come to live with us

84
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,959
we were so happy.

85
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,333
The house had been so empty
since you left

86
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,709
and we thought,
"here is our chance

87
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:46,709
to fill it with the sound
of children again."

88
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:49,458
But the truth is, Worf,

89
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:53,458
your father and I,
we're getting old.

90
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,709
Mother, you both
have many years.

91
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,750
Oh, I don't mean
we're ready for the grave.

92
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,875
Not yet anyway, but...

93
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,250
we're a little less active

94
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,834
and it's harder for us
to keep up with Alexander.

95
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,583
We're ready to be
just grandparents.

96
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:19,166
Alexander needs to be
with his father, Worf.

97
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,250
Mother, that is not possible.

98
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,959
We must find another option.

99
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,834
He needs his father, Worf.

100
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,458
Alexander's...

101
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,333
he's having difficulties.

102
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,834
Difficulties?

103
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,458
He's disobedient.

104
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,583
Mother...

105
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:50,083
Klingon children
are often difficult to control.

106
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,917
I do know something about
how Klingon children behave.

107
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:56,500
It's not just his
willful attitude.

108
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,417
He doesn't always
tell the truth.

109
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,834
My son is a liar?

110
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:09,083
He is a boy, Worf

111
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,875
and-and boys sometimes
take the wrong path.

112
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,208
They need guidance.

113
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,000
He needs a father--

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
his father--

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,625
to give him
that guidance.

116
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,500
I have to leave soon.

117
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,166
The transport will be
leaving for Earth.

118
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,917
You must do what you think
is best for him.

119
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,166
That's all a parent
can hope to do.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,750
Did you enjoy going
to school on Earth?

121
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,291
Yes.

122
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,709
Did you like your teachers?

123
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,291
Yes.

124
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,917
Good.

125
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,041
I understand you lived
in my old room.

126
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:10,208
Uh-huh.

127
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,041
Good.

128
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,875
Come in.

129
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,750
Lieutenant Worf.

130
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,208
Very nice to
see you again.

131
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,375
And you must be
Alexander.

132
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,208
I hear you'll be coming
to school with us for a while.

133
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,917
Well, we're very excited
to have you with us.

134
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,291
I know the other
boys and girls

135
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,500
will be happy
to have a new classmate.

136
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,291
Uh, first, I need to get

137
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,041
some information
from you.

138
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,917
Let's start with...

139
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,792
your name.

140
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:02,667
Alexander... Rozhenko.

141
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,041
Hmm. That's a tough one.

142
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,709
Maybe you could help me
with that.

143
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:07,250
Could you spell
your last name for me?

144
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,417
Alexander.

145
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:15,834
The teacher
asked you a question.

146
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,083
It doesn't matter.

147
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,166
I think I can figure it out.

148
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,875
Date of birth.

149
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,959
(<i> sighing</i> )

150
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:39,083
The 43rd day of Maktag,
Stardate 43205.

151
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,125
Yes.

152
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,166
Yes, of course.

153
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,667
I'll get
the rest

154
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,250
of his personal records
from the school on Earth.

155
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,834
And, oh, one last question.

156
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:50,542
How long will he be staying
aboard ship?

157
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,458
It has not been decided.

158
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

159
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,792
Come.

160
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,166
Mr. Worf, I thought
our meeting

161
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,917
was scheduled
for 1100 hours.

162
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,750
I apologize for being late,
Captain.

163
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,542
I was detained
in school.

164
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,750
I-I was enrolling my son
in class.

165
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,834
I see.

166
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:22,959
Well, Mr. Worf,
as you are aware

167
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,542
several new security officers

168
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,375
will be transferred
into the<i> Enterprise</i> next week

169
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,417
and I would like to discuss...

170
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,291
Kyle to Lieutenant Worf.

171
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,667
Worf here.
I'm sorry to bother you again,

172
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:33,834
Lieutenant, but I forgot

173
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,500
to mention
that we need to arrange

174
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,166
for a series of placement
examinations for Alexander.

175
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,333
If you could...

176
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,667
This is not a good time.

177
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:44,250
I will contact you shortly,
Ms. Kyle.

178
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,750
Sorry, Captain.

179
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,000
I would like to discuss
with you the specific areas

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,625
of ship security
that I would like...

181
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,375
Sick Bay to Worf.

182
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,041
Yes, Doctor?

183
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,000
I need to schedule a physical
examination for Alexander.

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,500
I also need his complete
medical records from Earth

185
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,917
and the medical records
of his...

186
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,542
I would rather discuss this
at a later time.

187
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,542
There's no rush.
Crusher out.

188
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:10,500
Mr. Worf, you are not
the first officer on this ship

189
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,542
to have a new family member.

190
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,709
Take care of your son.

191
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,500
The security
matters can wait.

192
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,542
Thank you, Captain.

193
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,083
23 field coils
working in concert

194
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,625
will generate
the soliton wave

195
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,709
from this point on
the planet surface.

196
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,041
We will have
our test ship

197
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,667
towed to a position

198
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:47,625
approximately two million
kilometers from Bilana III.

199
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,750
If our theories are correct

200
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,667
the wave will envelope the ship
and push it into warp.

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,083
Warp without warp drive.

202
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,625
They're going to put you
out of a job, Geordi.

203
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,792
I hope so, Commander.

204
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:02,959
DATA:
Dr. Ja'Dar

205
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,166
how closely
will the<i> Enterprise</i>

206
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,917
need to follow
the test vehicle?

207
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:10,291
The soliton emits a great deal
of subspace radio interference.

208
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,333
You'll need to remain
within 20 kilometers

209
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,750
in order to receive telemetry.

210
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,709
Doctor, how will you end
the experiment?

211
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:20,583
The wave will be directed
toward Lemma II

212
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,291
about three
light-years' distance.

213
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:27,125
Our sister facility there
will generate a scattering field

214
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,875
which will dissipate the wave

215
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,208
and bring the ship
out of warp.

216
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,083
I'll be sending you more
detailed operational plans

217
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,000
within the hour.

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,375
Very well, Doctor.

219
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,625
We'll contact you again
when we've finished

220
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,750
studying
the mission specs.

221
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,083
Worf.

222
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,583
I was just talking to Mrs. Kyle,
the primary school teacher.

223
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,000
She told me you'd
enrolled Alexander

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,750
in her class
this morning.

225
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,875
Yes.

226
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,375
I'm sure he'll
do very well.

227
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,208
She's a wonderful teacher.

228
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,458
Good.

229
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,583
Did she tell you about the
father/son

230
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,875
field trip this
afternoon?

231
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,625
Yes. We cannot attend.

232
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,291
Why not?

233
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,041
I have a personnel review
scheduled

234
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,709
at 1300 hours.

235
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,458
This would be
a good opportunity

236
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,208
for you to meet
some of the other
students and parents.

237
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,542
Well, I might be able
to reschedule the review.

238
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,917
Good.

239
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,417
I'll let them know
you're coming.

240
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,375
KYLE:
As the value
of their horns increased

241
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,291
the number of white rhinos
in the wild kept falling

242
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:53,625
until they finally became
extinct about two centuries ago.

243
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,250
Now, I'd like to show you
a pair of animals

244
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,500
that we're trying
to save from extinction.

245
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,125
Would you follow me?

246
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,500
(<i> quiet conversations</i> )

247
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:21,041
They're from Corvan II

248
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,291
where their homes
in the rain forests

249
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,667
are being threatened
by industrial pollutants.

250
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,333
They're called Corvan<i> gilvos.</i>

251
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,917
Well, they're a little shy.

252
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,125
Oh...
Oh...

253
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,583
Wow.

254
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,583
The eating habits

255
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,125
of the<i> gilvos</i>

256
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,291
are very similar to those
of Earth's Draco lizards

257
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:49,083
which died out
over 300 years ago.

258
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,834
There are only 14<i> gilvos</i>
left on Corvan II.

259
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,291
We're transplanting
these two

260
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,542
to the protected
planet Brentalia

261
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,667
where they
should thrive.

262
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,750
Well, why don't you all have
a look around

263
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,291
on your own for a while

264
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,291
and if you have any questions,
please feel free to ask.

265
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,250
Alexander

266
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,667
I'm sorry. I forgot
to tell everyone

267
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,333
that the models
on the tables

268
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,583
were for everyone to play with.

269
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,917
So I guess you didn't know you
weren't supposed to take them.

270
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,166
I saw you playing

271
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,500
with the lizard model
a while ago.

272
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,375
Do you still
have it?

273
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,959
Are you accusing him
of stealing?

274
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,834
Lieutenant Worf,
I can only tell you...

275
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:39,291
Alexander.

276
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:44,583
Did you take the model
of the lizard from the table?

277
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,125
No, sir.

278
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,375
Lieutenant

279
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:54,250
I saw Alexander put the model
inside of his jacket.

280
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:18,458
<i>Lieutenant Worf, Personal Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45376.8.</i>

281
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,208
<i>Alexander has acted shamefully</i>

282
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,917
<i>and, as his father,</i>
<i>I must now deal with him</i>

283
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,959
<i>but I find that I would rather</i>
<i>fight ten Balduk warriors</i>

284
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,625
<i>than face one small child.</i>

285
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,875
A Klingon's honor

286
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,000
is more important to him
than his life.

287
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,959
A Klingon would gladly face
the most horrible punishment

288
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,208
rather than bring shame
or disgrace to his family name.

289
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,625
His word is his bond.

290
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,208
Without it, he is nothing.

291
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,750
Do you understand?

292
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,041
Why did you lie to me?

293
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,208
I don't know.

294
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:08,458
Did you fear the punishment
you would receive?

295
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,917
I don't know.

296
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,500
You don't know why you lied,
and yet you did.

297
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,583
You don't know why you stole
and yet you did!

298
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:29,375
Alexander, come here.

299
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:49,667
When I was a child,
younger than you

300
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,667
I lost my parents...

301
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:53,542
my family...

302
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:54,917
my people.

303
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:57,750
Everything I had
was taken from me

304
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,667
except my sense of honor.

305
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:05,417
It was the one thing I had
that was<i> truly</i> Klingon

306
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,917
which no one
could take away.

307
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:10,709
Do you know
who they are?

308
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,875
Kahless?

309
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,834
And his brother Morath.

310
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:21,375
They fought
for 12 days and 12 nights

311
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,000
because Morath
had broken his word

312
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,208
and brought shame
to his family.

313
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:35,417
When you lie or steal,
you not only dishonor yourself

314
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:37,291
but your family.

315
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,375
You dishonor me.

316
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,250
I'm sorry, Father.

317
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,166
I won't do it
ever again.

318
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,917
I promise.

319
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:55,250
I accept your word.

320
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,291
We will not speak of this again.

321
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,208
Worf?

322
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,333
Counselor.

323
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,542
I just wanted to know

324
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,291
how the field trip
went yesterday.

325
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,625
You have not heard?

326
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,208
No. Why?

327
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,041
Bridge.

328
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,625
There was an... incident.

329
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,166
Alexander stole a small model

330
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,208
and then told
a falsehood

331
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:28,333
but I have remedied
the situation.

332
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,917
May I ask how?

333
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,583
I pointed out his error

334
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,792
told him about
Kahless and Morath

335
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:38,208
and explained
the value of honor.

336
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,458
The boy understood.

337
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,834
I see.

338
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,208
Sometimes these things
aren't over

339
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,667
as quickly as they seem to be.

340
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,000
I'd be happy to help
if you have

341
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,250
any further
problems.

342
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,417
Thank you.

343
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:54,834
That will not be necessary.

344
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:57,041
Alexander will not repeat
this mistake.

00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,291
DATA:
Sensors indicate

362
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,166
the field generators
on the planet surface

363
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,000
are charging, Captain.

364
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,792
The soliton wave
has been initiated.

365
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,083
It's heading for the test ship.

366
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,667
The test ship

367
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,750
has successfully
entered warp, sir.

368
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,333
Ensign, engage.

369
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:06,500
Ensign, bring us to within
20 kilometers of the test ship.

370
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,542
Aye, sir.

371
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,417
Telemetry looks good.

372
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,000
Soliton wave is steady.

373
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,583
The test ship is maintaining
at warp 2.35, sir.

374
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,333
That's a little faster
than they anticipated

375
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,959
but still,
well within mission parameters.

376
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:21,083
We're at 20 kilometers, Captain.

377
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,792
Mr. Data, is the wave
affecting our warp drive?

378
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:26,083
No, sir.

379
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,375
The effect has been localized
to within

380
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,375
two kilometers
of the wave front.

381
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,041
Mr. La Forge, what's the power
efficiency of the wave?

382
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,583
Energy transfer
is... 98%!

383
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,500
RIKER:
98?

384
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,000
LA FORGE:
Yes, sir. There's less than
two percent energy loss

385
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,792
between the wave and the ship.

386
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,792
That is 450%
more efficient

387
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,000
than our own warp drive.

388
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,875
Astonishing.

389
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,583
Commander Riker, have
Science Lab Three

390
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,834
begin a series of
gamma emission tests.

391
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:02,291
Sir, the wave's power signature
is fluctuating.

392
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,625
Wave efficiency
has dropped to 73%.

393
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,583
The test ship's warp field
is becoming unstable.

394
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,250
Sensors show multiple
disruptions.

395
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:14,041
I'm reading a severe
subspace distortion, sir.

396
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,875
It is expanding
toward us.

397
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,250
It appears to be interfering
with our engines, Captain.

398
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,709
I can't compensate for it!

399
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,709
Bring us out of warp,
Ensign. All stop.

400
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:23,792
Aye, sir.

401
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:24,959
All stop.

402
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,417
Hold on!

403
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,834
RIKER:
Damage report.

404
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:48,875
LA FORGE:
Sensors and warp
drive are off-line.

405
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,375
Deflectors
down to 15%.

406
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,375
WORF:
Several injuries
reported on deck 27.

407
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,458
No fatalities.

408
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,875
What happened
to the test ship?

409
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,625
Our last readings indicate
the craft exploded

410
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,583
due to extreme shearing stress.

411
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:03,208
Incoming message from
Bilana III, Captain.

412
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,041
On screen.

413
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,792
Captain, are you all right?

414
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:07,875
Was anyone hurt?

415
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,333
We sustained
some minor damage.

416
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,917
Do you know what happened?

417
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,709
The preliminary data
we've received

418
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:15,709
indicate
a transient power imbalance.

419
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,041
That would be consistent

420
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,667
with our telemetry readings
from the ship.

421
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,875
We detected a sudden drop
in transfer efficiency

422
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,750
just before the explosion.

423
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,375
Are you still tracking the wave?

424
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,542
No. The explosion damaged
our main sensor array

425
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,625
but I think we'll have it
repaired in a couple of hours.

426
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,792
We'll contact you as soon
as the sensors are back on line.

427
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:34,583
LA FORGE:
Doctor...

428
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,959
you did it--
warp without warp drive.

429
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,375
For a while there,
it was really something to see.

430
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,625
Well, I hope you're here
to see it

431
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,000
next time we try, Mr. La Forge.

432
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,500
LA FORGE:
So do I, Doctor.

433
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:58,792
I apologize.

434
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,208
I was detained.

435
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,375
It's quite all right.

436
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,125
Please, sit down.

437
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,917
Thank you.

438
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,750
Lieutenant, your son
is a very bright

439
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,166
very spirited young man.

440
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,750
From his test scores

441
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,041
I'm sure he'll turn out
to be one of my best students.

442
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:27,125
However, from his behavior
in class so far

443
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,250
I do have
some concerns.

444
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,166
What sort of concerns?

445
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:35,250
Frankly, he's defiant.

446
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,542
He's overly aggressive

447
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,667
toward the other students

448
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:40,083
and he has a great deal
of difficulty

449
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,834
paying attention.

450
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:44,166
Perhaps you do not
have experience

451
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:46,208
dealing with Klingon children.

452
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:49,083
They require a firm hand.

453
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:53,750
And he seems to still have
difficulty telling the truth.

454
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,959
He takes toys from
the other students

455
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:58,834
and then denies
taking them.

456
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,458
He acts like a bully

457
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:04,875
and then says someone else
started the fight

458
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:08,500
<i>and</i> he's bluntly
told me<i> you</i> said

459
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,375
"Klingons do not listen
to teachers."

460
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,125
I did not tell him that.

461
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:18,500
No, of course not.

462
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,875
He's acting
on his internal feelings

463
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:24,250
and then making up stories
to explain them.

464
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,500
It might be a good idea
for the two of you to sit down

465
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,083
with Counselor Troi
and try...

466
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:34,625
Computer,
where is Alexander Rozhenko?

467
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:38,667
Alexander Rozhenko
is on Holodeck Four.

468
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:41,125
Lieutenant, I-I
think we should...

469
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,375
<i>I</i> will handle this.

470
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:52,667
Computer,
what program is being run?

471
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:55,250
Calisthenics program
of Lieutenant Worf.

472
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,083
Difficulty level: novice.

473
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,458
(<i> growling</i> )

474
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,709
(<i> grunting</i> )

475
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,625
(<i> grunting with exertion</i> )

476
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:37,542
Computer, freeze program.

477
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,208
Did you see it, Father?

478
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,375
I won!

479
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:46,250
Yes, I saw.

480
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,792
Why are you here?

481
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:49,333
I'm training.

482
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:52,166
But you did not ask permission
to take my bat'leth

483
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54,333
or permission to use
the holodeck.

484
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,709
But you said you wanted me
to be a warrior.

485
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:59,625
I also said I wanted you
to obey your teachers

486
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:02,458
and keep your promise to me.

487
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:05,875
Ms. Kyle told me
about your behavior...

488
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,291
about your lies.

489
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,834
I have not lied!

490
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:10,625
Alexander, do not continue to...
She's lying!

491
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,959
She hates me.

492
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:14,208
That's why she makes up stories
about me.

493
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:16,125
I will not listen to more lies.

494
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,333
Return to our quarters.

495
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:26,083
But you said we could go
see the<i> gilvos</i> again.

496
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:29,083
Not now, not after you have
broken your word.

497
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:31,709
You promised.
You<i> said</i> that we could.

498
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:33,083
Enough!

499
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,458
It is now clear to me

500
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:39,208
that I have failed in my duties
as your father.

501
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,792
You have no understanding

502
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,709
about what it means
to be Klingon.

503
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:50,959
I will arrange for you
to attend a Klingon school.

504
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:52,166
There you will learn the lessons

505
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,792
I have failed
to teach you.

506
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,458
No. I won't go!

507
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:00,792
Would you further dishonor
our family

508
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,417
with your disobedience?

509
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,834
No, sir.

510
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:09,458
You will go to our quarters

511
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,458
and remain there until I return.

512
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,125
Riker to Engineering.

513
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,917
What's your estimate
on the engines, Geordi?

514
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,458
I need another hour, Commander.

515
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:30,291
I still have to replace
three power couplings.

516
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,583
Understood.

517
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,458
Sir, sensors are
coming back on line.

518
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:34,834
Good.

519
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,792
Begin a sensor sweep
for the soliton wave.

520
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:38,750
Aye, sir.

521
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,250
The wave is continuing
on a course

522
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,417
to the Lemma II colony.

523
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:46,208
It is bearing
020 mark 329.

524
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,875
Open a channel back here
to Dr. Ja'Dar.

525
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:52,583
Sir, the wave
has increased in velocity

526
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,208
to warp 4.1.

527
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,542
Doctor, we've located
the soliton wave.

528
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:00,000
It's still on a course
to Lemma II.

529
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,542
However, the velocity has
increased to warp 4.1.

530
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:04,834
Have you checked the
frequency resonance

531
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:06,333
of the subspace...?

532
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,750
Sir, the energy level
of the wave has increased

533
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,792
by a factor of 12.

534
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:13,041
At this rate, it will have
increased by a factor of 200

535
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:15,125
by the time it
reaches Lemma II.

536
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:17,000
Will we still be able
to dissipate the wave?

537
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,709
Commander, at
that energy level

538
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:20,959
the wave will not only destroy
the colony

539
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,750
it'll take most of the planet
with it.

540
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,959
Are you sure
this is what you want?

541
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:37,500
It is not a question
of what<i> I</i> want.

542
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,542
It is a question
of what is best for the boy.

543
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:43,083
He will be better off
at a Klingon school.

544
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,375
Have you discussed this
with Alexander?

545
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,959
He is a child.

546
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:49,166
I informed him
of my decision.

547
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:52,583
I see.

548
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,500
You disapprove.

549
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,375
I'm not here
to approve or disapprove

550
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:00,291
of the way you raise your son.

551
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:01,667
My concern right now

552
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:04,458
is how this decision
is going to affect you.

553
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,458
How will you feel
when Alexander's gone?

554
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,375
I will be pleased

555
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:19,250
that he is receiving
the guidance he requires.

556
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,542
Is that how you felt

557
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:22,250
when he left to live
with your parents?

558
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,500
That was different.

559
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,667
At the time, I felt he needed
a home, a family--

560
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,417
the things I could not provide
for him.

561
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:40,000
I understand.

562
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,875
The idea of raising a child
can seem a tremendous burden

563
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,583
especially to a solitary parent.

564
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:50,875
He was no burden.

565
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:54,041
I simply knew
that a Klingon child

566
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:59,208
required more... attention
than I could provide.

567
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,709
I see.

568
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,625
Have you ever wondered
how Alexander felt

569
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,208
about being sent away?

570
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:14,917
He was... very young.

571
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,959
I am sure that he was confused.

572
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:24,291
Do you think he felt abandoned?

573
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:25,792
After all

574
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:29,083
he left very soon
after K'Ehleyr's death.

575
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:32,041
In a way, he not only
lost his mother

576
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:34,166
he lost his father
as well.

577
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:44,291
Are you saying
that his misconduct

578
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:47,542
is a result
of feeling abandoned?

579
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:49,417
It's possible.

580
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:52,792
Children don't have
the experience

581
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:56,041
to handle emotional crises.

582
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,625
Instead of dealing
with their feelings

583
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,917
they act on them.

584
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:14,917
Tell me about the last time
you spoke with K'Ehleyr...

585
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:16,417
the night she died.

586
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,750
We argued.

587
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,959
About what?

588
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:23,917
Alexander.

589
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:25,291
About how she did not
tell me about him

590
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:27,500
when he was born.

591
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,375
So you were angry with her.

592
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,375
Yes.

593
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:33,959
Are you still angry with her?

594
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:39,542
Of course not.

595
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:43,166
It would be very normal
to be angry with her--

596
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:45,250
angry because she died
and left you alone

597
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,000
with a son
you never knew you had.

598
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:56,750
Being angry doesn't mean
you loved her any less, Worf,

599
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,375
but you can't hide
from your feelings

600
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:04,583
just as Alexander
can't hide from his.

601
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:08,583
You both have
a lot of healing to do.

602
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:11,000
Perhaps you should think
about doing it together.

603
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,834
(<i> door opens</i> )

604
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,750
Alexander...

605
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,417
I'm almost done.

606
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,792
Stop for a moment.

607
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:34,792
Let us talk.

608
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:36,792
Why?

609
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:40,750
I want you to understand
why you are going away.

610
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,959
I understand.

611
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,667
You're ashamed of me.

612
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:46,625
You do not understand.

613
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,583
I'm concerned
about<i> your</i> future.

614
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:52,375
A Klingon school will be
a better environment for you.

615
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,208
You don't care about me.

616
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:55,458
That is not true.

617
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,625
All you care about is
your honor.

618
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,250
Alex...

619
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,125
If your mother were here

620
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,250
I do not think that she would
want us to fight like this.

621
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,709
My mother wouldn't send me away.

622
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,166
RIKER:
Lieutenant Worf

623
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:14,458
please report
to the observation lounge.

624
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,000
Acknowledged.

625
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,291
Remain here.

626
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,875
I will return shortly.

627
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:24,417
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

628
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,083
Report.

629
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,250
The soliton wave

630
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,000
has continued
to increase in...

631
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,333
Excuse me.

632
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,583
DATA:
The soliton wave
has continued

633
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,000
to increase in power.

634
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,834
Its energy level has risen
by a factor of 96.

635
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:50,500
At its current rate of
acceleration, the wave
should hit the planet

636
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,834
in a couple of hours.

637
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,166
How do we stop it?

638
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:55,000
Well, there are
two possibilities.

639
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,959
We could attempt to use
our own warp engines

640
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:59,375
to generate an
inverse resonance wave.

641
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:02,000
If we could match the exact
frequency and amplitude

642
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,667
of the soliton, then
we<i> should</i> be able
to neutralize it.

643
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,291
You don't sound very confident.

644
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,333
DATA:
Because the soliton is
constantly changing

645
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,709
in both frequency and amplitude

646
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:15,709
it will be extremely difficult
to achieve an exact match.

647
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:17,125
Let's hear the second option.

648
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,709
Well, it's a little
more dangerous

649
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:21,041
but I think there's a
better chance for success.

650
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:23,458
We could create a backfire--

651
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:24,792
an explosive force set off

652
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,834
just in front
of the soliton wave.

653
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:30,417
A large enough explosion,
say five photon torpedoes

654
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,250
should be enough to
disrupt the wave

655
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,417
and allow it to dissipate.

656
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:36,458
How fast is
the wave traveling now?

657
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,291
Warp 6.37, Sir.

658
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:39,625
The good news is
we can catch it

659
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:40,917
but the bad news is

660
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,667
that in order to set up
this backfire

661
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:44,083
we have to be
in front of it.

662
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,417
Which would require the
<i>Enterprise</i>

663
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:46,750
to go through the wave.

664
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,500
Why can't we go around it?

665
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,417
The wave has been growing
in size as well as power.

666
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:53,000
There's insufficient time
remaining for us

667
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,583
to circumvent it
before it reaches Lemma II.

668
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,458
How much protection
will the shields provide

669
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,583
if we attempt to penetrate
the wave?

670
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,959
The shields have not been
fully restored.

671
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:04,041
Shield strength is down

672
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:06,333
to 33%.

673
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,667
It's going to be quite a ride.

674
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,125
(<i> sighing</i> )

675
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:13,166
It's the better choice.

676
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:15,041
Lay in a course
for the soliton wave.

677
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,750
Ensign, after we've passed
through the wave

678
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,417
I want you to take us
to a relative position

679
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:24,917
23 kilometers
in front of it.

680
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,375
Aye, sir.

681
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:28,083
Alert Sick Bay to prepare
for possible casualties.

682
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:29,375
Aye, sir.

683
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,500
The wave has increased in speed

684
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,250
to warp 7.2., Captain.

685
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,417
Ensign, take her
to warp 7.21.

686
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:42,542
We're approaching the wave,
Captain. Distance...

687
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:43,792
200 kilometers.

688
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:45,041
Let's see it.

689
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,166
PICARD:
Stand by to increase speed

690
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,625
to warp 7.3--
on my mark.

691
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:52,834
Red Alert!

692
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:53,959
Load torpedo bays.

693
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:55,792
Set warhead yields
to level 16.

694
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:57,083
Aye, sir.

695
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,792
All decks, this is the Bridge.

696
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:00,750
Brace for impact.

697
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,917
Torpedoes loaded.

698
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,333
Engage.

699
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:08,834
(<i> squeaky trilling</i> )

700
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:42,041
Report.

701
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,125
DATA:
We have passed through
the wave, Captain.

702
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:46,500
We have dropped
to warp 7.2.

703
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,959
The wave is directly astern
at a distance of 23 kilometers.

704
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:53,041
WORF:
Deflector strength
is down to 12%.

705
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:56,500
There are fluctuations in
several warp transfer conduits.

706
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,208
Tractor beams
and transporters off-line.

707
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:02,000
We have some gaps
in the aft shields, Captain.

708
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,417
When the torpedoes explode

709
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:04,583
these areas
will be contaminated

710
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,041
with ion radiation.

711
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:10,208
We need to evacuate
sections 24 to 47

712
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:11,583
decks 35 to 38.

713
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,000
Make it so.

714
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,625
WORF:
Sir, there is a fire
in Biolab Four.

715
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:18,875
The fire suppression apparatus
is not functioning.

716
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,375
Seal off
that compartment.

717
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:21,959
Prepare to vent
the air...

718
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:24,000
Sir, there are life-forms
present in that biolab.

719
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,417
We're transporting endangered
animals from Corvan II.

720
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:27,625
DATA:
Readings also indicate

721
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:29,333
the presence
of a humanoid, Captain.

722
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:31,333
Computer, identify
humanoid life-form

723
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:32,834
in Biolab Four.

724
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:35,834
Life-form is identified
as Alexander Rozhenko.

725
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,583
Bridge to Biolab Four.

726
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,750
Alexander,
can you hear us?

727
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,250
Sensors show he is alive.
He may be injured.

728
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,792
Can we transport him
out of there?

729
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:53,583
Transporters are still off-line.

730
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:55,083
Captain,
warp power is dropping.

731
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,500
We're losing speed.

732
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,417
Riker to Engineering.
Geordi, what is going on?

733
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:01,208
We lost four warp transfer
conduits, Commander.

734
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,250
RIKER:
The wave is gaining on us.
We need more speed.

735
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,125
LA FORGE:
I doubt that I can keep
<i>this</i> speed up

736
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,250
much longer, Commander.

737
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,625
You'd better
fire those torpedoes

738
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,291
while we're still in front
of the wave.

739
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,250
Mr. Data, how long
before the wave
overtakes us?

740
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,792
At our current speed,
four minutes

741
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:14,166
30 seconds, sir.

742
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:15,750
Captain, permission
to leave the Bridge.

743
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,333
Granted. Commander,
will you accompany Mr. Worf

744
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,667
to Biolab Four.

745
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:20,500
DATA:
Captain, Biolab Four
is one of the areas

746
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,625
that will be flooded
with ion radiation.

747
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:25,834
Commander, I can't let the
soliton wave hit the colony.

748
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:27,500
You have three minutes,
not one second more.

749
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,291
Primary control's shorted out.

750
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,250
(<i> grunting</i> )

751
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:57,917
Stand clear.

752
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:06,792
(<i> alarm wailing</i> )

753
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,875
WORF:
Alexander!

754
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,917
RIKER:
Alexander!

755
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:15,792
Can you hear me?

756
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:17,458
Alexander!

757
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:20,750
The soliton wave has closed
to ten kilometers, Captain.

758
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,500
Stand by to fire torpedoes
on my command.

759
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:27,834
RIKER:
Alexander!

760
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:32,417
Commander, I've found him.

761
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:33,583
Worf!

762
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,750
Where are you,
Worf?

763
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,000
Over here.

764
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,792
(<i> coughing</i> )

765
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:49,625
Help me.

766
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:59,375
It's too heavy. I've got to
find something to help us.

767
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,875
(<i> groaning</i> )

768
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,667
Father?

769
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:04,291
Be still. I am here.

770
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:06,792
My leg hurts.

771
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:08,500
I'm scared.

772
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:42,709
The<i> gilvos!</i>

773
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:43,709
There's no time.

774
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,750
Please! They'll die!

775
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,542
The wave has closed
to one kilometer, Captain.

776
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:53,625
Picard to Commander Riker.

777
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:54,750
Bridge to Lieutenant Worf.

778
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,125
Acknowledge.

779
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:57,959
The wave
is about to overtake us, sir.

780
00:41:57,959 --> 00:41:59,375
Commander Riker, acknowledge!

781
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,542
Fire torpedoes.

782
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:14,083
(<i> all coughing</i> )

783
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,000
The wave has been
disrupted, sir.

784
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,250
Picard to Riker.

785
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:29,625
Riker here, Captain.

786
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,834
We made it, sir.

787
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:33,875
The boy's going
to be all right.

788
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:48,959
You're a very
lucky little boy.

789
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,375
Just some minor
smoke inhalation

790
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:53,667
and a hairline
fracture of the tibia.

791
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:55,291
That's a bone in your leg.

792
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:57,709
I'd like to keep him
here overnight

793
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:59,542
but he should be
fine by tomorrow.

794
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:00,792
Thank you, Doctor.

795
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:14,500
Are you going to get in trouble
because of me?

796
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,834
Do not concern yourself
with that.

797
00:43:16,834 --> 00:43:20,166
Am<i> I</i> in trouble?

798
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:22,667
Yes...

799
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:25,875
but we will discuss that
at a later time.

800
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:28,625
I'm sorry.

801
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:31,500
I promise I'll be good
at the Klingon school.

802
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,792
I'll make you proud of me.

803
00:43:35,792 --> 00:43:39,458
Klingon schools are designed
to be difficult.

804
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:41,583
The physical
and mental hardships

805
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:43,166
faced by the students

806
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:45,709
are meant to build
character and strength.

807
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,417
However...

808
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:58,417
if you wish to face
a greater challenge

809
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:01,625
you may stay here with me.

810
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,500
It will not be easy...

811
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:07,667
for either of us

812
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:10,834
but perhaps we can
face the challenge together.

813
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:14,917
I accept your challenge, Father.

814
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:16,917
I will stay.

815
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:20,625
I believe your mother
would be pleased.
