1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:06,083
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,041
So, tell me.

3
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:15,417
Why is it so important
that you find this man?

4
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,834
We had business dealings.

5
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,333
He owes me money.

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,583
Ooh.

7
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,250
Well, if<i> we</i> had
business dealings

8
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:26,250
I can tell you
that<i> I</i> wouldn't disappear.

9
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,542
Maybe we can discuss
that possibility.

10
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,834
Ooh.
But first...

11
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:36,083
I have to find him,
collect the money I'm owed.

12
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:39,375
I'll be closing in a few hours.

13
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:44,709
Perhaps we could, uh...
discuss this more privately.

14
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,792
If I don't find him,
I'm going to have to move on.

15
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,291
Oh...

16
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,375
Are you<i> sure</i>
you haven't seen him?

17
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:55,166
Human.

18
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,166
About... two meters tall...

19
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,542
smooth-headed.

20
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,125
Hmm.

21
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:07,291
No. I don't remember
anyone like that.

22
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,500
You're lying.

23
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:12,250
And you're a Betazoid.

24
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,208
I thought so.

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,458
Listen.

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
People that come in here...

27
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:21,875
they count on a certain amount
of anonymity.

28
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:25,667
And if I were to start
answering questions about them--

29
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,542
even to a very
beautiful woman--

30
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:33,333
well, I wouldn't be
in business very long.

31
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:39,083
And being a businesswoman,
I'm sure<i> you</i> understand.

32
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,291
(<i> chuckling</i> )

33
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,375
Great story.

35
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:51,792
I'll remember it
next time I'm in a knife fight.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,041
Any luck?

37
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,250
I think the one over there
knows something.

38
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,208
He would not admit

39
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,458
to having seen the captain,

40
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,208
but he said anyone
who visited the ruins of Nafir

41
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,625
would probably
come here eventually.

42
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,875
I suspect he knows more.

43
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,041
Let's go.

44
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,625
Commander, I told...

45
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,208
My friend tells me
you know something

46
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,709
about the man
we're looking for.

47
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,125
The only reason
I'm talking to you

48
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,709
is that I have
a sister, too.

49
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,792
I explained to him
that we are looking for a man

50
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:37,166
who impregnated
your sister.

51
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,750
So, you can imagine how
much this means to me.

52
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,750
Family honor
is important.

53
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,583
If someone had defiled my sister

54
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:48,000
I would do anything,
<i>pay</i> anything

55
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,583
to find the one responsible.

56
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,333
And how much might
"anything" be?

57
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:57,291
As much as five bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

58
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,875
I think you've had
a little too much to drink.

59
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,834
You'd better leave.

60
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,500
On your way, Yranac.

61
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:06,667
I'm sorry...

62
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,625
but I think
he wants to stay.

63
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:12,250
Sit down.

64
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,458
RIKER:
That's my sister.

65
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,667
She's angry.

66
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,250
She's got a
vicious temper.

67
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,750
I wouldn't cross her.

68
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:22,333
You say one word
and you're a dead man.

69
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,375
Perhaps there's an element
of risk here

70
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:27,625
that I did not
fully appreciate.

71
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,792
Hmm. And how much more
latinum will it take

72
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:32,458
to offset this risk?

73
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,375
This isn't about latinum.

74
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:38,542
As a man with a sister--
a sister with a temper--

75
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,625
I can sympathize with you.

76
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:43,250
But...
how did you come here?

77
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,417
Do you have a ship in orbit?

78
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,667
Yes.

79
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:46,959
Then take me
with you.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,834
You can drop me anywhere.

81
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,417
Agreed.
Now, talk.

82
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:58,417
The man you're looking for
was here several weeks ago.

83
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,250
There was a group of aliens
sitting at this table.

84
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,875
He was asking them questions.

85
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:04,083
Who were these "aliens"?

86
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,583
I don't know,
but they looked dangerous.

87
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,041
They attacked him.

88
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,667
He managed to incapacitate
three of them

89
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,417
before he was
knocked down.

90
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,125
He was thrown
against that wall

91
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,917
and fell there.

92
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,458
I'm picking up
Starfleet fiber traces

93
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,417
and human cellular debris.

94
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,375
Can you establish
a DNA reading?

95
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,625
There's something strange here.

96
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,583
The cell structures
are badly distorted.

97
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,709
It's as if they've been exposed

98
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,709
to some kind of
high-energy field.

99
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,291
A weapon discharge?

100
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,166
It could be.

101
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,166
I'm picking up some faint traces
of micro-crystalline damage

102
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,750
in the floor material.

103
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:45,458
But I'm not familiar with
the pattern I'm getting.

104
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,583
Who are you people?

105
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,792
You didn't say anything
about a weapon.

106
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,208
I hadn't finished yet.

107
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,375
You'll like this.

108
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,500
The man got
what was coming to him.

109
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,333
When they knocked him down

110
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:01,291
one of them took out
a weapon and fired.

111
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,667
He was vaporized.

112
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,000
He's telling the truth.

113
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:42,709
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

114
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,000
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

115
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,333
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

116
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:52,542
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

117
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:56,875
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

118
00:05:56,917 --> 00:06:01,542
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,125
RIKER:
<i>Acting Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47135.2.</i>

120
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,917
<i>Dr. Crusher has</i>
<i>positively identified</i>

121
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,834
<i>Captain Picard's DNA.</i>

122
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,166
<i>There is no doubt now</i>
<i>that he is dead.</i>

123
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,083
(<i> door chimes</i> )

124
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,250
Come.

125
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,542
(<i> sighing</i> ):
How are<i> you</i> doing?

126
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,959
I'm all right.

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,208
The crew is
pretty shaken up.

128
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,583
I'm arranging
a memorial.

129
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:38,083
I think you should be the
one to deliver the eulogy.

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,291
I think you'd be better
at something like that.

131
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,709
Or Beverly.

132
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,750
She knew him the longest.

133
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:48,625
I know it's not
going to be easy,

134
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,291
but I think
it's important

135
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,750
that we face up
to what's happened.

136
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,417
You're in
command now.

137
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,291
The crew's looking
to you for guidance.

138
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,542
You don't understand.
I can't give the eulogy

139
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,250
because I won't be
at the service.

140
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,667
Will, a memorial service

141
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,959
helps to give everyone
a sense of completion.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,250
It helps them begin
the healing process.

143
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,250
That's exactly the point.
I don't want to heal.

144
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,125
Will...
I have an open wound.

145
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,166
Right here.
It hurts like hell.

146
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't want it to get better,

147
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,667
and I<i> don't</i> want to pretend
that everything's all right.

148
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,250
I know you're angry.

149
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,834
You're damn right!

150
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,458
And I intend to stay angry
until I find

151
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,500
whoever's responsible
for the captain's death.

152
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:41,041
Will, that's pretty
selfish of you.

153
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,291
Do you think you're
the only one in pain?

154
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,250
Do you think you have
the monopoly on loss?

155
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,417
Well, let me tell you something.

156
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,875
We're all hurting,
and we're all angry.

157
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,208
And whether you like it or not

158
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,583
you have a responsibility
to this crew!

159
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,166
And you can't just indulge

160
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,083
your personal desire
for revenge!

161
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,250
That is<i> enough,</i>
Counselor.

162
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,166
Deanna?

163
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,333
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,333
This is not about revenge.

165
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,000
This is about justice.

166
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,500
The captain died
in a bar fight for nothing.

167
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:29,500
Somebody has to answer
for that.

168
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:31,291
Then I can mourn.

169
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,792
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

170
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,667
(<i> console beeping</i> )

171
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,500
Commander,
I am receiving a transmission

172
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:49,458
from Admiral Chekote
at Starbase 227.

173
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,417
I'll take it in
the Ready Room.

174
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,792
Aye, sir.

175
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,709
Sir.

176
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,083
I read your report, Commander.

177
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,750
My condolences to you
and to your crew.

178
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:18,917
Captain Picard's death is a loss
to the entire Federation.

179
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,083
Now, I see that you've asked

180
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,417
to postpone your mission
to the Argus sector.

181
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,458
For what reason?

182
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,583
I have a request, sir.

183
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,458
I would like to conduct
an investigation

184
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,083
into Captain Picard's death.

185
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,709
The Dessican authorities

186
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,583
have jurisdiction
in this case, Commander.

187
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,041
I know that, sir.

188
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,458
Frankly, I don't have
much confidence

189
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,500
in the authorities
on Dessica II.

190
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:42,333
There's every reason
to believe that they're corrupt.

191
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,583
Well, I suspect you're right,
but the question remains

192
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,375
are<i> you</i> the one to pursue this?

193
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,166
The captain's death
hit me pretty hard

194
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:57,667
and I may not be
completely objective,

195
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:00,458
but there's no one
who is more determined.

196
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,750
I won't rest until I find out
who's responsible.

197
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,834
All right, Commander.

198
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,333
I'm officially placing
the<i> Enterprise</i> on detached duty.

199
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,917
Your mission is
at your discretion.

200
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,041
Good luck.

201
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,709
Thank you, sir.

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,583
Mmm... mmm.

203
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,166
Ah! Commander Riker.

204
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,959
I've been meaning
to speak to you.

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,375
I was wondering

206
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:34,709
if you could move me
to better quarters.

207
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,959
I-I don't care much
for the decor here.

208
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,834
These are
the best quarters we have.

209
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,041
Hmm.

210
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,125
I was hoping now that you've
had a chance to relax

211
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,041
you might have remembered
some of the details

212
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,250
about the aliens you saw--

213
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,625
something you may have
forgotten before.

214
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,333
Sorry. My memory isn't

215
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,625
what it used to be.

216
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,625
They murdered
a man in cold blood

217
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,125
in full sight of everyone
in the bar

218
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,125
and you can't remember
anything about them?

219
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:11,083
Now that you mention it,
I do remember one thing.

220
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,291
They said they'd kill anyone
who talked about what happened.

221
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,250
Do you know where they went?

222
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,458
So, you know who they are

223
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,041
and you know
where I can find them.

224
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,500
Perhaps I do.

225
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,291
What do you want?

226
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,959
Not a great deal, Commander.

227
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,291
Just a shuttlecraft.

228
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,417
I believe I'd like
to travel for a while

229
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,875
see more of
the galaxy.

230
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:43,959
You understand.

231
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,166
A shuttlecraft.

232
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,333
Well, here's my offer.

233
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:52,291
Instead of the ship,
I'll give you some time.

234
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,291
Time?

235
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,000
If you're lucky,
you'll only spend

236
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,375
the next five years in prison,
instead of the next 20.

237
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,500
You've got 12
outstanding arrest warrants

238
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:07,125
for fraud and petty theft
in the Klingon Empire.

239
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:11,208
You tell me what you know,
I'll pull some strings.

240
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,458
Maybe they'll reduce
your sentence

241
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,875
after you've been extradited.

242
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,750
If I tell you what I know,

243
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,834
you must promise not
to give me to the Klingons.

244
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,291
I'll think about it.

245
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,125
Perhaps you could... send me

246
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,375
to a Federation
rehabilitation colony instead.

247
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,375
Talk.

248
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,667
The aliens were some kind
of mercenary group.

249
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:34,458
They've been operating
in this sector

250
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,750
for the last six months.

251
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:37,250
Where do we find them?

252
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,792
I heard one of them mention
the Barradas system.

253
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,000
I think they were headed there.

254
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,500
You<i> think?!</i>

255
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,375
That's all I know.

256
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:49,750
Riker to Data.

257
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:51,250
DATA:
Data here.

258
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,834
Take us out of orbit.

259
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,166
Set course
for the Barradas system.

260
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,500
Warp six.

261
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,625
DATA:
Aye, sir.

262
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:13,375
Barradas III is
the only Class-M planet

263
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,417
in this system

264
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,208
and it is listed
as unpopulated.

265
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,875
However,
sensors have detected

266
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,208
intermittent
energy signals

267
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,250
emanating
from its surface.

268
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,583
What's the source?

269
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,083
Well, the signals
are difficult

270
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,875
to localize,
but they could be emissions

271
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,500
from some kind
of power converter.

272
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:29,583
Which would indicate
a base or a ship.

273
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,333
What else do we know
about Barradas III?

274
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,875
The planet was used
as an outpost for the Debrune

275
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:36,083
approximately 2,000 years ago.

276
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,291
The Federation's
archaeological survey

277
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,500
has catalogued numerous ruins
on the surface.

278
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:44,709
Mr. Worf, I'd like
a security detail

279
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,333
to accompany the away team
to the surface.

280
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,542
I'll lead the away team.
Geordi, you're with me.

281
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,375
Mr. Data,
you have the bridge.

282
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:53,917
Aye, sir.
Commander?

283
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,667
As acting first officer

284
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:58,375
I must question your decision
to accompany the away team.

285
00:14:58,417 --> 00:14:59,500
If Captain Picard
were here...

286
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:00,583
He's not.

287
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,667
I realize that, sir,
but if he were

288
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:05,500
and he wanted
to lead an away team

289
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:07,166
you would tell him
that the captain's place...

290
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,417
Is on the Bridge.

291
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,500
Not this time.

292
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,291
Ensign, you take
that area.

293
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,458
Yes, sir.

294
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,166
(<i> birds chirping</i> )

295
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,417
MAN:
Here you are, sir.

296
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,250
Geordi?

297
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,291
It's tough to get
accurate sensor readings.

298
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,041
There's an awful lot of
interference in the area.

299
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,166
From what?

300
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,709
I'm not sure.

301
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,500
It's very unlocalized,
but it could be atmospheric.

302
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,333
What do you make of these?

303
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,000
Well, these ruins
around here are
pretty ancient,

304
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,709
but I'd say that
this indentation

305
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,083
was made fairly recently.

306
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,709
It could be the site
of some battlefield.

307
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,709
This doesn't look
like any blast point

308
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,083
I've ever seen.

309
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,750
The shape is too perfect.

310
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:05,291
Commander, there's
micro-crystalline damage

311
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,083
all throughout
this area.

312
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,000
It's the same kind of pattern
that Dr. Crusher picked up

313
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,125
on the floor of that
bar on Dessica II.

314
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,625
WORF:
Commander!

315
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,291
I've found something.

(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

317
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,417
it looks as if someone could
have just dropped it.

La Forge to<i> Enterprise.</i>

319
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,959
We are under attack
down here.

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,333
I repeat, we are under attack.

321
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,208
Commander, we've lost contact
with the away team.

322
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,166
Is there a malfunction?

323
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,208
No, sir.

324
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,208
The com system

Negative, sir.

330
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,583
There's too much interference.

331
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,083
I'm going to head
for those trees over there.

332
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,959
If I can get there, we might
be able to set up a cross fire.

333
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,709
Data to away team.
Please respond.

334
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,625
Data, we've
been attacked.

335
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,041
We've got one casualty

336
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,917
and commander Riker
has been taken captive.

337
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:21,250
Sir, the mercenaries
have beamed away.

338
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,125
They must have a base
or a ship nearby.

339
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,709
Can the sensors
locate anything?

340
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,000
Commander, we're picking up
a vessel leaving orbit.

341
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,667
Why was it not
detected earlier?

342
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,959
They could have been using
the planet as a shield.

Their speed is warp 8.7

I think they're
at their maximum.

353

Take us to warp nine
and pursue.

354

00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:13,792
Commander, the sensor image
of that ship is extremely weak.

359
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:16,750
It's fading.

360
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:20,041
The ship doesn't register
on the long-range sensors.

361
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,709
I'm sorry, sir.

362
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,083
We've lost them.

363
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,458
Increase
the sensor field bandwidth.

364
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,208
Patch in
the lateral sensor arrays.

365
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,750
It's no good.
The signal's gone.

366
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:35,333
It just... disappeared.

367
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,208
Plot a course and take us back
to Barradas III.

368
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,166
Notify the away team
to prepare for transport.

369
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,875
Aye, sir.

370
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:51,083
Starfleet intelligence confirms

371
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,917
that a ship matching
this configuration

372
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,166
has been linked to raids

373
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,750
on several other planets
in this sector.

374
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:59,083
For the short time
it was within our visual range

375
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,333
we were able to take

376
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,667
sensor readings
of the mercenary vessel.

377
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:06,834
It appears to be encased in
an energy-absorbing material.

378
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,709
Although we can see the ship

379
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,208
this energy sheath renders it
virtually undetectable

380
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,542
to our long-range sensors.

381
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,875
There must be<i> some</i> way
we can track it.

382
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,667
LA FORGE:
Data?

383
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:19,458
I know this is a long shot,

384
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
but if I remodulate
the long-range sensor array

385
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:24,041
I might be able to make it
sensitive enough

386
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,583
to detect the ship.

387
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,458
Without a full
compositional analysis

388
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,667
of the energy sheath,
our chances of finding

389
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:32,250
the correct remodulation
sequence are remote.

390
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,375
Sir, they have taken
Commander Riker.

391
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,375
We must do something.
We cannot just sit here.

392
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:41,166
On the contrary,
Lieutenant,

393
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,500
that is precisely
what we must do.

394
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,709
Since there are
no viable alternatives

395
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,208
we will return to the surface
and attempt to determine

396
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,583
what these mercenaries
are doing on this planet.

397
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,041
An investigation
might reveal

398
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,083
some indication
of their purpose.

399
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,291
Please notify me
when you have assembled

400
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,333
your search teams.

401
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,333
Dismissed.

402
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,959
MALE 1:
What's the problem?

403
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,834
MALE 2:
I warned you not to push
the engines so hard.

404
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,709
Two of the power shunts
are on the verge of collapse.

405
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,417
We'll be lucky if we
can maintain warp six.

406
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,125
How long will it
take to repair?

407
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,291
I can try to realign
the warp core.

408
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,375
It'll take at least 11 hours.

409
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:42,792
But I'll have to shut
the engines down completely.

410
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,291
We're not stopping.

411
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,000
We can't afford to be
sitting helpless in space.

412
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,041
I want warp eight
available in five hours,

413
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,125
and I don't want to
hear your excuses.

414
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,542
What were you doing
on Barradas III?

415
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:07,583
William T. Riker
Commander, SC 231-427.

416
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,792
Oh, really?

417
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:13,291
Well, I am Arctus Baran,

418
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,500
and I don't have a number.

419
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:19,083
Now, what were you doing
on Barradas III, Commander?

420
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,709
We were studying
the ruins.

421
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,041
It was a scientific
expedition.

422
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,959
Don't patronize me.

423
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,875
Those ruins have been
studied for centuries.

424
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:33,083
There's nothing new
to learn from them.

425
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,625
Then what were<i> you</i>
doing there?

426
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:38,750
(<i> gasping and moaning</i> )

427
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:40,667
Oh, don't bother,
Commander.

428
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:42,083
You can't remove it.

429
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,875
It's a neural servo
connected directly

430
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:45,125
to your nervous system.

431
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,166
It lets me
control precisely

432
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,083
how much pain you feel.

433
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,917
This setting is
usually sufficient.

434
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:54,375
However, if necessary,
it can go much higher.

435
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,500
(<i> yells</i> )

436
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,417
These devices
were the idea

437
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,083
of my predecessor.

438
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,542
It's a convenient way
of enforcing discipline.

439
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,417
What happened to him?

440
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,667
He failed to
enforce it with me.

441
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:10,041
This is a waste of time, Baran.

442
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,750
Get rid of him now.

443
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:14,959
You should be more patient,
Vekor.

444
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,542
It might be rewarding.

445
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,834
We will wait.

446
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,625
Let the memory
of his pain

447
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,542
argue with him
for a while.

448
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,667
It might change
his attitude.

449
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,834
Vekor is right.
We should get rid of him.

450
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,291
It's dangerous having someone
from Starfleet on board.

451
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,500
Dangerous?
It might be profitable.

452
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:37,667
A Starfleet commander

453
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,375
is a valuable
hostage.

454
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,208
Starfleet won't
negotiate with us,

455
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,375
but they'll pursue us
as long as we have him.

456
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:47,250
(<i> groans</i> )

457
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,792
This discussion
is over.

458
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:51,083
Get back to your post, Vekor.

459
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,959
PICARD:
They're right, Baran.

460
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,542
And you know it.

461
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,625
I say kill him.

462
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,875
Now.

463
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:16,000
PICARD:
If he has nothing
to give us,

464
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,500
we should kill him now
and be done with it.

465
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:21,667
Everybody seems to recognize
that fact, except you.

466
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:24,083
I don't need a consensus
to run this ship, Galen.

467
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,041
(<i> engine powering down</i> )

468
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,458
(<i> beeping</i> )

469
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,166
What's going on?

470
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,083
I'm bypassing
the aft plasma couplings.

471
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,542
The power loss should only last
for a few seconds.

472
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:44,709
You should learn
not to limit your options.

473
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,208
Riker could be very useful to us
in the future.

474
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,667
He may not be as useful
as you think

475
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:52,959
if this is the same Riker
that I've heard about.

476
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,166
What Riker
might that be?

477
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:57,000
Commander
of the<i> Enterprise</i>

478
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:59,959
formerly assigned
to the USS<i> Hood.</i>

479
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,625
That's right.

480
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,250
Then you must be
the William T. Riker

481
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,875
with a history of
insubordination.

482
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:08,125
He was even once
relieved of duty

483
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,458
during the
Cardassian incident

484
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,834
at Minos Korva.

485
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,291
How do you know all this?

486
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,291
Look, I've been
smuggling artifacts

487
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:17,458
from Federation
sites for years.

488
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,041
You can't help
developing

489
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:23,083
a familiarity with certain
Starfleet personnel.

490
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,125
If we hadn't have
captured him,

491
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:28,041
he'd probably have
ended up before
a court-martial.

492
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:31,375
I've gotten out
of them before.

493
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,542
Look, he's no use to us.

494
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,000
Finish him now

495
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,583
or let me do it for you.

496
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:43,625
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

497
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,625
Watch him.

498
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,083
We're accelerating.

499
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,542
What have you done?

500
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,125
It has nothing to
do with my repairs.

501
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:54,417
I think there's
a malfunction

502
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,583
in the engine's
intermix chamber.

503
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:59,208
Plasma pressure is rising.

504
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,834
Where's the malfunction?

505
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:03,041
It could be one of
any 30 subsystems.

506
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,709
It'll take time to locate.

507
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,291
I don't think you're
going to have the chance.

508
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,750
Plasma pressure has reached
critical levels.

509
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,625
Seal off
the intermix chamber.

510
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:13,375
I can't-- the override sequence
won't engage.

511
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:16,208
The antimatter-flow regulator
is locked open.

512
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,000
VEKOR:
Logic subsystem
still not responding.

513
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:19,959
Get out of the way.

ROMULAN:
Plasma pressure

515
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,542
has exceeded
maximum levels.

516
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,750
Eight percent above critical
and rising.

517
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,375
We have to jettison the core.

518
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:28,333
No.
We'll be stranded here.

519
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:31,375
The flow regulator is frozen.

520
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,500
Let me do it.

521
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:36,083
I've had a lot
of experience

522
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,250
with this sort
of systems failure.

523
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:39,333
I might be able
to do something.

524
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,667
Plasma pressure
is 11% above critical.

525
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:43,000
The containment fields
are beginning to degrade.

526
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,083
Go!

00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,458
MERCENARY:

529
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:51,166
Containment fields
won't hold much longer.

530
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,917
Looks like you've got
a control logic lockout

531
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,625
on your regulator's
subsystem.

532
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,917
I'm going to attempt
to run an active bypass

533
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,959
through the plasma-flow
converter.

534
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,625
You! Start running
phase-locked feedback

535
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:03,792
through that regulator.

536
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:05,792
I want about
a six-second delay.

537
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,166
What are you saying?

538
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,959
I don't take orders from you.

539
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,208
You do as he says.

540
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,875
Plasma pressure is 14%
above critical.

541
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:14,709
If you fail...

542
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,125
We'll all be dead, anyway.

543
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,291
I just need
a few more seconds.

544
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,875
Plasma pressure is dropping.

545
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,917
We're back into safe levels.

546
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,625
You want to make sure
that doesn't happen again

547
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:39,792
you'd better reinitiate your
regulator subcompressors.

548
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:41,583
A full diagnostic of
your intermix chamber

549
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:42,625
wouldn't hurt, either.

550
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:43,917
Do it.

551
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,208
Put him in quarters
for now.

552
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:55,709
You still wish
you'd killed me?

553
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:04,542
(<i> birds chirping</i> )

554
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:10,250
The search teams
have reported in.

555
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,291
They found several
archaeological sites.

556
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,834
Each one has
been looted.

557
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,166
LA FORGE:
It's possible that

558
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,750
the micro-crystalline
damage I found

559
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:18,625
in these indentations is
the result of some kind

560
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,250
of high-energy
transporter beam.

561
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:23,625
But I still don't
understand.

562
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:26,417
There's nothing here that's
particularly valuable.

563
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:29,166
Why would anyone want to
steal any of these things?

564
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,333
Perhaps these artifacts

565
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,583
have a special value
to the Romulans.

566
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:35,083
The Romulans?

567
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:38,709
These structures were built
by the Debrune.

568
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,959
That race is an ancient
offshoot of the Romulans.

569
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,500
The ruins on the planet
where Captain Picard was killed

570
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:46,041
were also Romulan in origin.

571
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,667
The leader of the group
that attacked us was Romulan.

572
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:50,375
Perhaps they are controlling
the mercenaries.

573
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:52,625
The question remains--

574
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:55,000
why are they stealing
these artifacts?

575
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,208
There are several archaeological
sites in this sector

576
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,542
containing ruins
which are Romulan in origin.

577
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:08,792
These are the locations

578
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:10,291
that were attacked
by the mercenary vessel.

579
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,500
Looks like they did
a pretty thorough job.

580
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:16,083
The only sites not attacked
were on Calder II

581
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,834
Yadalla Prime
and Draken IV.

582
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:21,125
Yadalla and Draken are at
the far edge of the sector

583
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:23,834
but Calder II--
that's less than

584
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,542
a day from here
at maximum warp.

585
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:28,250
That would be
their next likely target.

586
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,917
According to this

587
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,750
there's a Federation outpost
at Calder II.

588
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,583
But it is only
a small science station.

589
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,709
It has limited
defensive capabilities.

590
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,375
I do not believe
it could withstand an attack

591
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:40,959
from the mercenary ship.

592
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,625
Mr. Worf, send a message

593
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:45,875
to the Federation outpost
on Calder II.

594
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,500
Advise them that if a ship
matching the configuration

595
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,291
of the mercenary vessel
approaches

596
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,458
they should attempt
to delay it until our arrival.

597
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,208
Ensign,
take us out of orbit.

598
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,625
Set a course
for the Calder System.

599
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,125
Warp nine.

600
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,000
ENSIGN:
Aye, sir.

601
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,250
(<i> door opening</i> )

602
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:15,709
We don't have much time.

603
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:22,917
It's good to see you, Will.

604
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,542
I didn't expect
to meet you here.

605
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:26,750
I was looking
for the people

606
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,583
who killed you
on the surface.

607
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,667
A witness said
they saw you vaporized.

608
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:32,667
These mercenaries
use weapons

609
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:35,208
that can activate
their transporter.

610
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,750
It gives them
the opportunity

611
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:39,166
to beam things
away quickly

612
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:40,625
just by firing at them.

613
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,500
That's what
they did to me.

614
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:43,917
I don't understand
any of this.

615
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,125
Who are these people?

616
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,834
What are you doing
involved with them?

617
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:50,000
The site that I wanted
to study had been raided.

618
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:52,667
One of the artifacts
had been stolen.

619
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:55,917
The site had been
practically destroyed.

620
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:57,834
Well, I wanted
to find out who
was responsible.

621
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:01,750
I tracked them to that
bar on Dessica II.

622
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:04,834
Well, I must have asked
too many questions.

623
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:05,834
They captured me.

624
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,125
They wanted to find out

625
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,792
how much I knew about
their operation.

626
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,041
And then you became
part of their crew?

627
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:14,375
I convinced them
I was a smuggler

628
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:16,000
and that my name was Galen.

629
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,166
I offered to help them
appraise the artifacts

630
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:20,375
that they'd stolen.

631
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:23,834
Will, these are not
common thieves.

632
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,083
They are stealing
Romulan artifacts

633
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:29,291
from archaeological sites
throughout this sector.

634
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,000
Baran has me analyzing
each one of them

635
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:34,667
for a particular
particle signature.

636
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:37,875
Will, they are looking
for a specific artifact.

637
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:39,625
Why?

638
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,417
That's what
we have to find out.

639
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,250
Baran is the key.

640
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:45,083
I think that he knows
more about

641
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,458
what we're really looking for
than anyone else on this ship.

642
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,750
I want you to get close to him.

643
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:50,959
Try and get
his confidence.

644
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,583
That's why you set up
the engine failure--

645
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,208
because you knew that
I'd be able to fix it.

646
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,208
He also believes that you're

647
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,417
a less-than-perfect
Starfleet officer.

648
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,333
Will, I want you to
play into that role.

649
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:05,583
Baran and I...

650
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:08,250
Well, he doesn't care
very much for me.

651
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,834
But he has to tolerate me

652
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:15,375
because he needs my help
with these artifacts.

653
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:17,208
But if you and I
become enemies,

654
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,291
then there's a better chance
of you and he becoming friends.

655
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,291
All right.

656
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,875
I'll do what I can.

657
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:25,250
(<i> door opening</i> )

658
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:27,792
(<i> groans</i> )

659
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:32,959
What are you doing here?

660
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,083
Getting some answers.

661
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:38,250
Because you can't
get him to talk.

662
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,375
(<i> groans</i> )

663
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:45,959
No one conducts
an interrogation on this ship

664
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,542
without my permission.

665
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,000
Is that understood?

666
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,000
(<i> groans</i> )

667
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:24,208
Our next objective should prove
an interesting challenge.

668
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,500
We're headed for
the Sakethan burial mounds

669
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:27,542
on Calder II.

670
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,250
PICARD:
What?

671
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:33,333
Calder II isn't just another
archaeological site, you know.

672
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:34,417
It's a Federation outpost.

673
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:36,333
I don't see that
as a problem.

674
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,417
PICARD:
It's defended
by Starfleet.

675
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,750
You don't think they're
just going to stand by

676
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:43,250
while we walk in there
and take whatever we want?

677
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:46,041
I am familiar
with the tactical situation.

678
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,959
What are their defenses?

679
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,208
Nothing to worry about.

680
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,959
They have
a type-4 deflector shield

681
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,083
protecting the outpost
and the ruins.

682
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,667
They also have a minimum
of two phaser banks

683
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:58,792
and possibly photon torpedoes.

684
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:00,583
Is that enough
to worry about?

685
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:03,709
How do you know
so much about
this outpost?

686
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,792
Because I tried to smuggle
a Sakethan glyph stone

687
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,959
out of there
nearly two years ago.

688
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,583
I barely got away in one piece.

689
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,041
Our weapons are more
than a match

690
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,166
for their defenses.

691
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,333
I anticipate that
we'll be able

692
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:17,041
to destroy
the outpost

693
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,542
within 15 minutes.

694
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:21,250
Then we'll send in Tallera
and the landing party

695
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,667
to secure the relics.

696
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:24,375
Why don't we use Riker?

697
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:26,291
A Starfleet commander

698
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,792
could talk us past
the outpost security

699
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:30,291
without raising
their suspicions.

700
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,667
Then, when their shields go down

701
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:34,709
we could beam
the artifacts up here

702
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,166
without ever leaving
the ship.

703
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,625
Why would Riker help us?

704
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,083
Just because he's out of favor
with Starfleet

705
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,583
doesn't mean that he's ready
to betray them.

706
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:44,000
If he doesn't help us

707
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,667
we'll have
to destroy the outpost

708
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,417
and kill everyone on it.

709
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:48,959
He's still a Starfleet officer.

710
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,458
He won't want to take
innocent lives

711
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,458
if he can possibly
prevent it.

712
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:59,291
The last time we
engaged Starfleet

713
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,875
we lost a man.

714
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:02,792
We can't afford
any more casualties.

715
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,041
If we can avoid a battle,
I think we should.

716
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:12,250
All right, we'll try it.

717
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:15,417
We'll be at Calder II
within five hours.

718
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,041
You all know your duties.

719
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,750
I want this ship
prepared for battle...

720
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:22,542
in case your plan doesn't work.

721
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,667
Computer, reset diagnostic
for a new sample.

722
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:50,500
Lot number... 478-B.

723
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:55,750
Access spectral analysis
and begin scan, mode three.

724
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:00,750
COMPUTER:
Scan complete.

725
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,125
Terikon particle decay profile

726
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:06,000
does not fall within
specified reference range.

727
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:09,250
Probability of match: 0.04%

728
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:18,542
Computer, reset diagnostic
for a new sample.

729
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:23,125
Lot number 369-B.

730
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:30,291
Access spectral analysis,
mode two, begin scan.

731
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,959
Baran wants to see
the analysis of
the last lot.

732
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,375
He thinks you're moving
a little slowly.

733
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:37,333
You can tell Baran,
if he wants

734
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,041
the analysis done faster,
he can do it himself.

735
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:42,083
If he wants it done correctly,
he can wait.

736
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:47,750
Do you enjoy living
dangerously, Galen?

737
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,750
Baran can kill
you in an instant

738
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,125
if he activates
his control device.

739
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,250
I doubt that
he'll do that.

740
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:58,291
I've increased the accuracy
of the identification process

741
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,041
by a factor of ten.

742
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,333
I'm the best person
to analyze these artifacts.

743
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,458
Baran knows that.

744
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:12,083
He may need you now,
but I know Baran.

745
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,417
And I can tell you

746
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:16,291
he's not going to
back down forever.

747
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:20,500
You accomplish nothing
by provoking him.

748
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:23,750
I don't like operating
in the dark.

749
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:26,166
If I knew what the point
of this mission were,

750
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,709
why I was analyzing
these relics...

751
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,166
If Baran felt it were wise
to let the crew know that

752
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,709
I'm sure he would have.

753
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,583
Do you know
what all this is about?

754
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:42,583
What Baran knows, I know.

755
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:44,834
Then what's going on here?

756
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:48,166
Why are we risking our lives
taking these artifacts?

757
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:49,417
Who wants them?

758
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:52,333
I see no reason
to tell you anything.

759
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:55,000
But you can
rest assured.

760
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:57,500
I don't necessarily
share everything I know

761
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,166
with Baran either.

762
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:03,792
This conversation,
for example

763
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:06,208
will stay between us.

764
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,875
You can tell Baran every
word that I've said.

765
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:12,875
He knows that I
don't think much
of him as a leader.

766
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,291
He's been in charge
of this crew

767
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,667
for a long time.

768
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:18,166
Baran wouldn't last
five minutes as captain

769
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,291
if he didn't have
that control device.

770
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:23,625
The crew follow him
because they have no choice.

771
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:27,542
Baran's power is based
on fear and intimidation.

772
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:30,917
That almost sounds
like a prelude to mutiny.

773
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:33,083
If someone
were to challenge him,

774
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:35,041
the rest of the crew
would follow.

775
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:37,166
I was right.

776
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:40,250
You<i> do</i> like
living dangerously.

777
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:48,542
I like you, Galen.

778
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:51,792
I can tolerate a lot
from someone like you

779
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:55,041
but only to a point.

780
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,834
I intend to complete
this mission successfully

781
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:59,166
and get what's
been promised me.

782
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,333
If it looks as though

783
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:03,250
you're getting
in the way of that

784
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:05,583
I'll deal with you myself.

785
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,208
Commander, no one is allowed
on the surface

786
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,750
without prior authorization

787
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,375
from the Federation
Science Council.

788
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:25,959
I'm aware of
that,<i> Lieutenant,</i>

789
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,959
but your outpost is
in imminent danger of attack.

790
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,667
I would like to station
security personnel

791
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:33,500
on the surface
for your protection.

792
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:36,959
Now, I'm ordering you
to drop your shields.

793
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,917
I'm sorry, sir,

794
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,375
but the regulations
are very specific.

795
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:42,000
I can't do it.

796
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,709
If you'd like,
you can remain in orbit

797
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,750
until we contact
the Science Council.

798
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:47,250
But we're experiencing

799
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:49,500
some communication difficulties
right now, so that...

800
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:51,041
This isn't working.

801
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,000
They're delaying
on purpose.

802
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:56,875
Someone has warned them.

803
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:59,333
Charge main
disrupter array.

804
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:00,750
Destroy the outpost.

805
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:02,041
No! There's no time for that!

806
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,250
Starfleet will be here
any minute.

807
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,458
What are you doing?

808
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,333
I'm configuring the
disrupters to fire

809
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:09,875
a phase-resonant pulse.

810
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:11,166
If I can hit their
shield generator

811
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,166
with precisely
the right frequency

812
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,667
I should be able to take
it out with one shot.

813
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:16,834
Firing.

814
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,375
Their shields are down.

815
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,041
The artifacts should be located
in several small structures

816
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:27,208
arranged
in staggered formations.

817
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,542
I'm scanning.

818
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,417
I think I've found them.

819
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,625
Lock coordinates
and start bringing them up.

820
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:43,417
There should be at least
two more down there.

821
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,375
I've lost transporter lock.

822
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:50,000
They managed to get
their shields back up.

823
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:53,125
I need those artifacts.

824
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:55,875
Lock all disrupters
on target.

825
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:59,458
This time, I want
that outpost destroyed.

826
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,208
Direct hit
on their aft deflectors.

827
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,583
They are undamaged.

828
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:13,083
Ensign, scan
for Starfleet combat signals.

829
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,125
Is Commander Riker
aboard that ship?

830
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,792
I can't tell, sir.

831
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:19,000
Sensors are unable
to penetrate their hull.

832
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,291
Open a channel.

833
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,709
WORF:
Open.

834
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,125
This is the federation
starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

835
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:26,208
You are ordered to stand down.

836
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,625
Drop your shields,
and prepare to be boarded.

837
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:30,709
You sent them a message.

838
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,709
You told them
where to find us.

839
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,667
That's ridiculous.
When did I have a chance?

840
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,166
This is set to kill.

841
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:39,041
Order your ship
to disengage.

842
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,834
Activate visual.

843
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,458
Commander...
are you all right?

844
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,709
Tell them.

845
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,834
Mr. Data,
withdraw the<i> Enterprise.</i>

846
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,125
That's an order.

847
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:05,166
That is impossible, sir.

848
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:06,250
The ship you are on

849
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,417
has violated
a Federation outpost.

850
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:10,125
It is my duty to stop it.

851
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:13,667
I'm your commanding officer.
I'm giving you a direct order.

852
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:15,041
Understood?

853
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:20,250
Commander,
if you could explain...

854
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:22,375
I've never explained
my orders before.

855
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,834
I'm not about
to start now.

856
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,125
I'm not about to let him
blow this ship into space.

857
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:32,083
If I can set up
a low-level com link

858
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,458
between the two ships

859
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,792
I can use my personal
command codes.

860
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:36,417
I can deactivate
the shields.

861
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,792
Do it.

862
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:46,083
(<i> console beeping</i> )

863
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:48,834
Sir, we are receiving
some kind of signal

864
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:52,250
from the mercenary ship.

865
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:54,375
These are Commander Riker's
access codes.

866
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:56,625
He is attempting
to shut down
our shields.

867
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:57,959
That doesn't make sense.

868
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,083
He knows those codes
would have been changed

869
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:00,834
as soon as he was captured.

870
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,417
That is correct, Counselor.

871
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,208
He does know.

872
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,125
Mr. Worf...

873
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:11,166
prepare to drop shields.

874
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:16,291
Sir, we would be
totally defenseless.

875
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,959
I am aware of that.

876
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,959
Sir, as soon as they see us...

877
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,792
Mr. Worf,
that is an order.

878
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,959
Aye, sir.

879
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:32,625
It worked.

880
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:35,041
The shields
are dropping.

881
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,917
Fire.
