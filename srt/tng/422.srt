00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:09,250
<i>Counselor Deanna Troi,</i>
<i>Personal Log, Stardate 44805.3.</i>

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,917
<i>My mother is on board.</i>

3
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:22,417
Jean-Luc, you
delicious man!

4
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:23,875
You were just
thinking of me

5
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,041
weren't you?

6
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,250
As a matter of fact...

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,667
Well, think no
further, dear heart.

8
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,792
She's here.

9
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:30,959
Yes, indeed.

10
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,208
Oh, serious.

11
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,917
You're always so serious.

12
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:36,583
Lwaxana...
Hmm?

13
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,083
As a matter of fact,
I am rather busy at the moment.

14
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,250
And you're always busy
with something or other.

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,166
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Never the right
thing, though.

16
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,709
My daughter tells me

17
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:48,834
that we're, um, picking up
someone interesting here.

18
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:52,875
Yes, the leading scientist
from Kaelon II, and...

19
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,625
Oh, Kaelon II!

20
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,458
I've never
heard of that.

21
00:00:56,458 --> 00:01:00,959
Well, Lwaxana, it is something
of a rather delicate...

22
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh...

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,667
...situation.

24
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:08,834
It's the first real contact
with a rather reclusive race

25
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:13,792
and... this is in the nature
of an official greeting, so...

26
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:15,125
Oh, diplomacy.

27
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,917
Oh, I<i> adore</i> diplomacy.

28
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:19,750
Everyone dresses so well.

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,250
Mr. O'Brien, energize.

30
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,125
Dr. Timicin,
I'm Jean-Luc Picard

31
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,667
Captain of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

32
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:41,625
This is Lieutenant Commander
La Forge.

33
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,166
I beg your pardon, Captain.

34
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,250
This is my first time aboard
a Federation starship.

35
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh, yes, they told me.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,959
The shaking of hands--
a form of greeting.

37
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,792
(<i> clears throat</i> )

38
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:55,792
I beg your pardon.

39
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:57,625
Dr. Timicin, allow me
to present

40
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,583
Lwaxana Troi of Betazed.

41
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,000
She is also
a guest on board...

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,250
And Daughter of the Fifth House

43
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,875
Holder of the Sacred Chalice
of Rixx

44
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,375
Heir to the Holy Rings
of Betazed

45
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,250
and what are you doing
for dinner?

46
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,583
Well, I don't know really.

47
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:14,333
Lwaxana, we have quite
a bit of work planned.

48
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,709
Well, the man's
never been

49
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,834
on board a starship
before, Jean-Luc.

50
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:20,041
Certainly somebody ought
to make him comfortable

51
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,709
before you get started.

52
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,291
Well, it seems
that Mrs. Troi

53
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:27,625
is our acting ambassador
of goodwill for today.

54
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,125
You just think of me
as your entertainment director.

55
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,500
(<i> chuckles</i> )

56
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,417
That man's in
a lot of trouble.

57
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:08,542
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

58
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:12,959
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

59
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,709
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

60
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,291
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

61
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:22,875
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

62
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:26,500
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

63
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:27,083
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44805.7.</i>

64
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,250
<i>For generations,</i>
<i>the people of Kaelon II</i>

65
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,291
<i>have been working</i>
<i>to revitalize their dying sun.</i>

66
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,333
<i>The Federation has offered</i>
<i>to assist in testing</i>

67
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,917
<i>what may be a solution</i>
<i>to this problem.</i>

68
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:39,417
Of course, the basic theories
of helium fusion enhancement

69
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:42,208
have been discussed
for over a century

70
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,750
but there's been no practical
method of application

71
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,000
until now.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,709
DATA:
The modifications you have made

73
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:49,625
in the torpedoes guidance
systems are remarkable, Doctor.

74
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,500
Well, we'll see.

75
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,917
They still have to be proved.

76
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,834
But now at least it's possible.

77
00:04:57,834 --> 00:04:59,917
I'd never dared to hope
for such a perfect match

78
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:01,333
with our own sun.

79
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,500
My only regret is that
it took us three years

80
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,000
to find a suitable sun

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,208
after you had
first contacted us.

82
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,917
We're not used to dealing
with other worlds.

83
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:14,458
We're not used to asking
for anything from others.

84
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,166
Your offer of help

85
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,875
has given us a possible
means of survival.

86
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,959
It has taken
40 years of my life

87
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,291
to develop the programming

88
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:25,750
that will control
your photon torpedoes.

89
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,333
It has been my life.

90
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,375
Thank you for this opportunity.

91
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:35,208
My only wish has been to find
a way to revive our sun...

92
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,792
before I die.

93
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:47,375
Mrs. Troi, I must protest

94
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,709
your unauthorized presence
on the Bridge.

95
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,875
What does that little
one do, Mr. Woof?

96
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,166
Please, madam!

97
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:57,375
That is a torpedo
launch initiator, and...

98
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,917
And it is "Worf,"
madam, not "woof."

99
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:00,625
Oh... ah!

100
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,542
There you are, my dear.

101
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:03,583
Where have you been?

102
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,125
I've been waiting
for you.

103
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,834
So nice to see you again
so soon.

104
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,208
Mrs. Troi.

105
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,959
Mother, what
did you want?

106
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,000
What?

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,375
You were waiting
for me.

108
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,875
Oh, yes, dear,
of course I was.

109
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,166
You really must let me

110
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,750
do something to relieve
the tedium

111
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,166
of all this work,
work, work.

112
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,875
I'm afraid I'm expected
in Engineering.

113
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm really terribly sorry.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,959
Oh.

115
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,625
Mrs. Troi

116
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,291
I have to ask you
to clear the Bridge, please.

117
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,500
I don't see why.

118
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,542
There are lots
of other people here.

119
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:35,458
Mother, please.

120
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,583
Well, don't you worry.

121
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,166
We'll just have our
little chat later.

122
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,667
I'd never have thought her
old enough to be your mother.

123
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:55,458
She is so...

124
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,208
vibrant.

125
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,500
If you look at the next
simulation, you'll see

126
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,166
that we need the temperature
to stabilize at 220 million.

127
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,375
Otherwise there's a secondary

128
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,583
then a tertiary
reaction to the...

129
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,792
Ah, ah, ah!
Enough is enough.

130
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,709
Rescue is at hand.

131
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,125
Ah, Dr. Timicin.

132
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,625
Oh, would you clear
all this mess

133
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,583
off the table,
please?

134
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,375
This mess, Mrs. Troi...

135
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,792
Now, now, now.

136
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,125
You boys have been
shut up in here

137
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,542
for<i> hours.</i>

138
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,125
Now, if you don't
eat something

139
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,542
you're going to get sick

140
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:32,542
and who's that
going to help?

141
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:34,500
I've made some
perfectly marvelous

142
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,417
Mantickian patÃ©.

143
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:37,625
Mr. Homn

144
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,291
will lay it out
for us.

145
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,792
Oh, Mr. Homn is my valet.

146
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,542
He doesn't say much.

147
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:46,041
(<i> sotto voce</i> ):
How can he?

148
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,083
It is true that the
intellectual efficiency

149
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,458
of high-order beings does
diminish proportionately

150
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,041
with the deprivation
of nutritious fuel...

151
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,750
All right, all right.
Don't you start.

152
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,500
TIMICIN:
Mrs. Troi,

153
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,583
you're a wise woman.

154
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,667
I'm sure we could use a respite.

155
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:05,834
These two call me Mrs. Troi.

156
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:09,667
You call me Lwaxana.

157
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,917
Mr. Homn...

158
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,792
spread it.

159
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,458
So, knowing
my daughter's starship

160
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,750
would be passing fairly close
to Betazed again

161
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,834
I maneuvered a ride
and, um, here I am.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,375
Deck eight.

163
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,000
I also have
a grown daughter.

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,583
She has a small son
of her own.

165
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,166
Oh. Then, you're married.

166
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,250
My wife died
quite some years ago.

167
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,083
You know, one thing
I don't understand.

168
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,875
If your people have
known for generations

169
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,834
that their sun is dying

170
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,959
why not simply
evacuate the planet?

171
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,291
It is our home.

172
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,709
It defines who we are
as a people.

173
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,166
If Kaelon II
ceases to exist

174
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,542
so do we.

175
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:16,125
Well, then you
definitely
should fix it.

176
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,542
With the Federation's help,
I... I hope we will.

177
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:20,834
And the Federation
will be pleased

178
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:24,041
to offer whatever
help it can.

179
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,125
Would you come in
for a nightcap?

180
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,083
Well, that's extremely
kind of you, but...

181
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,500
My valet sleeps elsewhere.

183
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,875
You're delightful.

184
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,500
You make me laugh.

187
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,166
that your invitation
makes me laugh.

188
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,208
I mean, I take that
quite seriously.

189
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,375
I-I mean...

190
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,208
Oh, but... Don't...
Just say yes.

191
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,875
I'll make you
laugh some more.

192
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,333
I wish I could...

193
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,834
but I must say no.

194
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,041

Oh, I tried telepathy on him.

210
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,709
He's the wrong species.

211
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,750
Right species
for everything else, though.

212
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,291
You might try that

225
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:38,709
Very well.

226
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:40,834
Mr. Worf?

227
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:45,458
Photon torpedoes armed...

What about heat

245
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,375
Steady so far.

246

Density at 1100 grams

247
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,542
Temperature approaching
60 million degrees Kelvin.

248

I'm so sorry, Timicin.

294

I had one of those
named after me once.

Brilliant, young astronomer
from Rigel IV.

296
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:55,542
Of course, I, um, I sparkled
a bit myself in those days.

297
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:57,417
You see, that's called
fishing for a compliment.

298
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,500
You're supposed to tell me
I still sparkle.

299
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,041
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,291

I'm just not adequate
company right now.

00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:11,875
Oh, that's all right.

304
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,458
I can make enough conversation
for both of us.

Please stay.

309
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,083
I wanted to tell you

00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,542
how much I wish we
had met years ago.

311
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:37,375
What difference
do a few years make?

312
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,667
Unfortunately,
a great deal.

313
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,792
You see, Lwaxana,
I'm on my way home now...

00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:07,709
<i>and established contact with</i>
<i>Science Minister B'tardat.</i>

318
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,083
The experiment achieved
a stable core temperature

319
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,542
for a short time, Minister.

320
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,417
That's a significant
step forward.

321
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:16,083
We've been studying the sensor
logs and the torpedo telemetry

322
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,792
to determine if there was
any malfunction.

323
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:20,500
If there was and we are able
to isolate the problem

324
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,208
another test
might be successful.

325
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,375
And in the meantime,
all of our facilities

326
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,625
would be made available
to Dr. Timicin.

327
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,500
A most thoughtful
and generous offer

328
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,208
but Timicin has obligations
at home

329
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,083
and it would take us some time
to select a replacement.

330
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:37,959
We would be more
than willing

331
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,083
to extend our visit, sir.

332
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,917
That will not be necessary.

333
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:44,333
We'll contact you
as soon as we're ready.

334
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,959

Come.

338
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,750
Are you aware these people
you are so graciously helping

339
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,834
are murderers?

340
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,375
I beg your pardon?

341
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,250
Well, the next thing to it.

342
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,834
When a person on this
benighted little planet

343
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:14,458
reaches the age of 60--
which Timicin is about to do--

344
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,250
they're expected
to simply kill themselves.

345
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,792
Did you know that?

346
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,375
Mr. Data?

347
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,709
The people of Kaelon II
are isolationists

348
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:24,917
almost to the point
of being xenophobes.

349
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:27,667
Regrettably, we know very little
about their customs.

350
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:30,333
Well, I know.
Timicin himself just told me.

351
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,667
He is supposed to go down there
to his loving friends

352
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,792
be wined, dined, honored
for his achievements

353
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,625
and then kill himself.

354
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,500
It's a barbaric ritual.

355
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,417
The, um... "The
Resolution," it's called.

356
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:45,583
Obviously, you can't
let him go, Jean-Luc.

357
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,750
I'm afraid I have no choice.

358
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,375
I don't think
you've been listening to me.

359
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,417
The man is supposed
to kill himself.

360
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,959
Now, you don't
just let that happen.

361
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:58,125
You don't just
turn your back.

362
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,792
What's the matter
with you?

363
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:02,458
Lwaxana, I'm sorry, but
whatever my personal feelings

364
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,083
I have no jurisdiction here.

365
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,542
I simply cannot interfere.

366
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,542
But you have to.

367
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:12,792
In a situation like this, you
absolutely have to interfere.

368
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,417
You've got to go
down there.

369
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,542
Talk to those
people, Jean-Luc.

370
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:19,041
Open their eyes-- educate them.

371
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,750
The Prime Directive

372
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,959
forbids us to interfere with
the social order of any planet.

373
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,500
Well, it's<i> your</i> Prime Directive,

374
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,959
<i>not</i> mine.

375
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:33,291
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

376
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,041
Computer, locate
Counselor Troi.

377
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,417
What do you mean
I can't go down there?

378
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,333
Are you telling me that I'm
a prisoner on this ship?

379
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,959
Mother, what's going on?

380
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,333
What are you doing?

381
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,542
I'm sorry, Counselor.

382
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:53,917
I'm not sure
what to do here.

383
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,250
Well,<i> I</i> am sure.

384
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,792
I am a Betazoid ambassador.

385
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:58,250
I'm a Daughter
of the Fifth House

386
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,625
and those people are
going to answer to me.

387
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,917
So, y-you just energize
this damn thing

388
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:04,667
and get me down there!

389
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:05,875
He can't, Mother.

390
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,417
He has his orders.

391
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:09,500
His orders don't apply to<i> me.</i>

392
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,583
No, they apply to him.

393
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,583
And don't you try your
professional patronizing

394
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,959
on<i> me,</i> young lady.

395
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:20,667
They expect Timicin to die,
don't you realize that?

396
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:23,041
Just because he's 60.

397
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,083
What's 60?

398
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,625
It's nothing.

399
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,458
(<i> sobbing</i> )

400
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,250
I'll go check
the pattern buffers.

401
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:40,458
<i>Come on, Mother,</i>
<i>let's sit down.</i>

402
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,792
<i>I-I'm sorry, Little One.</i>

403
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:48,166
<i>I-I don't know</i>
<i>what's wrong with me.</i>

404
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,291
<i>I'm... I'm sorry.</i>

405
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,125
<i>There's no need to be.</i>

406
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,333
<i>But I'm crying.</i>

407
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,875
<i>I don't cry.</i>

408
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,667
<i>You cried when father died.</i>

409
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,709
You remember that?

410
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:06,125
Of course I remember.

411
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,583
We both cried.

412
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,750
But... but this
isn't the same.

413
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,333
Is it?

414
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,917
What do you think?

415
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:19,709
Oh... I-I don't know.

416
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:26,458
I... I just can't accept
that... that fate

417
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,458
would allow me to
meet him like this

418
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,834
and then take him away.

419
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,583
I mean, he's not ill.

420
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:38,166
He hasn't had
a tragic accident.

421
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,166
He's just going to die

422
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,375
and for no good reason.

423
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:51,000
Because his society
has decided that's he's too old

424
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,166
so they just dispose of him.

425
00:21:56,834 --> 00:22:02,542
As... as though his life no
longer had any value or meaning.

426
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,625
You can't possibly

427
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:13,583
understand at your age,
but, well, at mine...

428
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:20,166
Well, sometimes you
feel tired and-and afraid.

429
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,583
You're feeling
very vulnerable.

430
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,959
Very mortal,
if I may say so.

431
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,917
But I know you, Mother,
and believe me

432
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:40,250
you will never be one of those
who dies before they die.

433
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,667
(<i> door chimes</i> )

434
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:52,959
Come in.

435
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,875
I've been studying
the preliminary reports

436
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,166
of the test.

437
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:08,709
I-I don't understand
where it went wrong.

438
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:11,917
I thought I had taken into
account all of the variables--

439
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:16,417
deep convection patterns,
proton reactions

440
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:18,458
neutrino count.

441
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,875
(<i> sighs</i> )

442
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,458
Oh.

443
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:29,417
I will say it again--
you are a kind woman.

444
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:34,041
No, no,
I'm a hateful woman.

445
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,917
I hate what
you're going to do

446
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:38,583
and I hate you for doing it.

447
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,500
It is the way of my world.

448
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,417
I wish you
could accept that.

449
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,834
I never will.

450
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:52,583
Never.

451
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,542
How long have you
been sitting there?

452
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,291
Oh, I don't know--
a minute, an hour.

453
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,583
Lwaxana...

454
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:27,875
Do you want anything?

455
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,417
Some tea?

456
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:32,375
I want to explain.

457
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:38,166
I want... very much
for you to understand.

458
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:45,250
15 to 20 centuries ago,
we had no Resolution.

459
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,083
We had no such concern
for our elders.

460
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,625
As people aged, they...

461
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,959
Their health failed.

462
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:54,709
They became invalids

463
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:57,291
and those whose families
could no longer care for them

464
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:01,750
were put away
into deathwatch facilities

465
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,166
where they waited in loneliness
for the end to come

466
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:07,125
sometimes... for years.

467
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:13,458
They<i> had</i> meant something

468
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:16,792
and they were forced
to live beyond that

469
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:21,000
into a time of meaning nothing--

470
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,125
of knowing that they
could now only be

471
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:28,166
the beneficiaries
of younger people's patience.

472
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,625
We are no longer
that cruel, Lwaxana.

473
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:38,583
No, no, you're not cruel
to them, you just kill them.

474
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,625
The Resolution
is a celebration of life.

475
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,750
It allows us to end our lives

476
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,041
with dignity.

477
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,959
"Celebration of life."

478
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:47,542
Sounds very noble, very caring.

479
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:49,208
What you're really saying is

480
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:52,959
you got rid of the problem
by getting rid of the people.

481
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,709
It may sound that way

482
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:58,166
but it is a time
of transition--

483
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:01,500
one generation passing on
the responsibilities of life

484
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,542
to the next.

485
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:04,834
What about the
responsibility

486
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:06,500
of caring for
the elderly?

487
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,625
That would place a dreadful
burden on the children.

488
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:17,083
We raise them, we care for them,
we suffer for them

489
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,542
we keep them from harm
their whole lives.

490
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:22,750
Now, eventually, it's their turn
to take care of us.

491
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,542
No parent should expect
to be paid back

492
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,667
for the love
they've given their children.

493
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:29,875
Well, why the hell not?

494
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,166
Oskoids.

495
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,333
What's that?

496
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:42,250
Oskoids-- a Betazed delicacy.

497
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,000
Looks very interesting.

498
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,750
You should have tried it
while you were still alive.

499
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,083
No reason to bother now.

500
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,458
Why 60?

501
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,709
Why not 62? 58?

502
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:54,291
A reasonable age
had to be set.

503
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:58,041
But it's not reasonable,
certainly not in your case.

504
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:00,625
You're as vital and healthy
a man as I've ever known.

505
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:02,250
That is why I wish
to say good-bye

506
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,166
to my family and colleagues
while I am this way--

507
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,792
in full command
of my faculties

508
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,625
knowing that they will
always remember me

509
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,959
as a strong and
vigorous man.

510
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:13,583
But it makes no sense.

511
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:16,583
Some of your people could still
be active at 70 or 80

512
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:19,792
and others might
be seriously ill at 50.

513
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:21,041
How cruel of you
to make them

514
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,709
wait so long
to commit suicide.

515
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:25,083
Setting a standard age
for the Resolution

516
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,000
makes it uniform
for everybody.

517
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,583
To ask individual families

518
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,959
to decide when their
elders are to die--

519
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:33,000
<i>that</i> would be heartless.

520
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,458
I agree.

521
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:37,375
Why not let everybody die
when they die?

522
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,709
Lwaxana...

523
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:40,959
You have a grandson,
you said.

524
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:44,333
Yes, almost seven.

525
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:47,750
Well, wouldn't it be better
for him to<i> know</i> his grandfather?

526
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,166
I mean, not some vague memory
of someone who once loved him

527
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:56,333
but a real, living person
who<i> does</i> love him.

528
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,458
Don't you really think
that would be better?

529
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,959
I attended the Resolution
of my parents

530
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:07,834
when it was their time.

531
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:10,667
It was beautiful.

532
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,542
Lwaxana, this is
a custom that
I have known

533
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:17,583
and accepted all my life.

534
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:20,083
The women of Betazed
used to wear these enormous wigs

535
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,625
with large holes in the center

536
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:23,500
for tiny,
caged creatures.

537
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,125
Yes?

538
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:27,291
First, it was a fashion

539
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,750
then it went on long enough
to become a custom--

540
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,792
a tradition--

541
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,667
but it was uncomfortable
for the woman

542
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:36,041
and cruel to the animal.

543
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:38,792
So then one day,
one very formidable woman

544
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:40,458
finally said so--

545
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:44,667
refused to ever wear
another of those wigs.

546
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:48,375
Fairly soon, the custom stopped.

547
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:51,959
She had the courage to stand up
and fight for change.

548
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:57,250
She must have been
a lot like you.

549
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,750
Timicin, there is
no one more qualified

550
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,750
more experienced,
or more likely to save
their planet than you

551
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,417
and they would have
you kill yourself.

552
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:08,375
Younger scientists
will take my place.

553
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,375
My work...

554
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:13,250
<i>the</i> work will continue.

555
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,083
Your planet has what,
30, 40 years left?

556
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:19,375
What if your scientists can't
find the answer without you?

557
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,667
What then?

558
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:22,500
What chance do you
think your grandson has

559
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,000
of reaching the age of 60?

560
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,667
Enough, please!

561
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:31,458
It is my time, Lwaxana

562
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:34,417
and that is the way it is.

563
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

564
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,291
Well, if that's
the way it is,

565
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:43,417
I don't know why
anyone's bothering

566
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:46,458
to try to save
your planet at all.

567
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:49,166
If it's time has come,
let it die.

568
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,917
Where is the difference,
Timicin?

569
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:56,750
Where?

570
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:09,291
Convection boundary uncoupling.

571
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:11,375
The reaction... caused

572
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:14,166
gas turbulence of a totally
unexpected magnitude.

573
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,166
Why?

574
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:18,166
There was evidence
of a delayed surface shock.

575
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,792
No, I'd anticipated that.

576
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,834
I thought I'd anticipated
all possible variables

577
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:29,583
but stars, you know, they're
like living entities in a way--

578
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,000
quite unpredictable.

579
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,750
You know...

580
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,583
I wouldn't be
at all surprised if this

581
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,125
were a result of...

582
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:45,750
Look here.

583
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,000
42 seconds into the test,
there is a sudden rise

584
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,125
in the level
of hydrogen-alpha emissions.

585
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,375
And here is another.

586
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,583
I'm right, aren't I?

587
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,792
There had
to be neutron migration

588
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,959
within the star's inner core
as the reaction grew.

589
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,417
Perhaps, Doctor, but there
is no known method

590
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,375
for controlling
a neutron migration.

591
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:08,250
Yes, yes, but theoretically,
it is possible.

592
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,667
Using these test results,
we could construct

593
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:13,875
a new computer model
of the energy dynamic of a star

594
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:18,375
that<i> can</i> test
a new detonation program.

595
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:22,083
I'm certain it can be
accomplished, certain.

596
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:23,375
It's just a matter of time.

597
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,959
A matter of time.

598
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,000
(<i> door chimes</i> )

599
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,208
Come.

600
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,041
Timicin.

601
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,458
Time for you
to leave us then.

602
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,875
Captain...

603
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:48,583
I have come
to officially request...

604
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:50,792
asylum aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

605
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,917
Timicin, I cannot believe this.

606
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:06,291
Why asylum?

607
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,917
Asylum from what?

608
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:09,959
I turn 60 in four days,
Minister.

609
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:11,875
Yes, and your family
and colleagues

610
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,875
are already gathering
for your Resolution.

611
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:18,208
I believe that it is time for us
to reexamine

612
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:21,834
as a people,
the wisdom of the Resolution.

613
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,417
Are they forcing you into this?

614
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:28,166
Are you being coerced?

615
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:30,166
Influenced, perhaps.

616
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,000
Coerced? No.

617
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,917
Our only influence, Minister,
is by example.

618
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:39,417
Timicin's decision is his
own free will, I assure you.

619
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:42,375
I cannot believe that a man
of Timicin's stature

620
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:45,041
would freely choose
to reject his own culture.

621
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:48,125
No one on Kaelon II understands
this project as I do.

622
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,709
There are new theories

623
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:51,750
that would take others
a decade to test and confirm.

624
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,542
With my guidance, it could be
done in half that time.

625
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:55,333
I must finish my work.

626
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,875
Others started your work,
others will finish it.

627
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,625
It has always been this way.
It always will.

628
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,959
RIKER:
Captain, scanners indicate
two Kaelon warships

629
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:06,834
rising on an intercept course.

630
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:08,834
Acknowledged, Commander.

631
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:11,208
Minister, we are here
in friendship

632
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,792
hoping to be of assistance.

633
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,041
You have helped
quite enough, Captain.

634
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,750
I suggest you return Timicin
and depart.

635
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,458
If you attempt to leave orbit
with Timicin on board

636
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,792
our ships have
been ordered to open fire.

637
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,458
B'tardat, there's
no purpose at all

638
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:25,583
in letting this become...

639
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

640
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:35,917
It shouldn't have happened.

641
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:38,125
I've handled this poorly.

642
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,125
You acted in good
conscience, Doctor.

643
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:42,208
I don't see what else
you could have done.

644
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,750
I could have let
well enough alone.

645
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,458
I could have returned home.

646
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,500
What do you think, Captain?

647
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,250
Have I done... the right thing?

648
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:00,625
I'm afraid you're the only one
who can answer that.

649
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,709
Lwaxana would...

650
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,667
Would have me lead a revolt.

651
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,917
I'm only a scientist.

652
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:18,417
I wish I had her strength.

653
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:21,583
She is a woman of extraordinary
conviction, isn't she?

654
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:27,041
Isn't she.

655
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:32,458
Any communications, Number One?

656
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:34,125
No, sir.
We have an open channel.

657
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:35,166
WORF:
The warships are taking

658
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,959
a standard attack posture.

659
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:39,583
Staggered approach vectors,
within weapons range.

660
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:40,625
Shields up.
Red Alert.

661
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,166
Captain...

662
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,542
Doctor, I suggest that you
return to your quarters.

663
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:44,959
I don't want there
to be any bloodshed

664
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,333
because of my decision.

665
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,208
They will do everything
they can to avoid it.

666
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:49,792
I think we should get
out of their way now.

667
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:52,625
Yes, yes, of course.
I understand.

668
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,333
Mr. Worf, ascertain
their offensive potential.

669
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,709
Aye, sir.

670
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,625
We must transmit
the new analysis

671
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,250
of neutron migration,
immediately.

672
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,208
If I can make them see the
direction that I've taken...

673
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:09,291
LA FORGE:
We've already tried.

674
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,500
They refuse to accept

675
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,709
further reports
from you, Doctor.

676
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,500
They<i> have</i> to accept it.

677
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,041
If I can reestablish
a computer interface

678
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,291
with the Science Ministry...

679
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,166
They've disengaged
the linkup, Doctor.

680
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,041
Why don't they answer?!

681
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,583
Even if I find the solution,
you will not accept it?!

682
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,667
Because I do not
terminate my life

683
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:36,000
they terminate my work.

684
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,667
Alive, I am a greater threat
to my world than a dying sun.

685
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:50,792
But Jean-Luc will find
a way to settle this.

686
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:52,166
No.
He always does.

687
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:53,375
No, my decision
will only lead

688
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,500
to more distrust
of other worlds.

689
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,458
Nothing will change.

690
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,542
Now, don't be foolish.

691
00:35:56,542 --> 00:36:00,542
I am not being foolish!

692
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,542
Lwaxana, I want to live
because I see in you

693
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,959
how much I have
to live for.

694
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,250
You make me realize

695
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,291
that my life
still has value.

696
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,625
I<i> can</i> be an example
to my people.

697
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:19,375
I<i> can</i> finish my work.

698
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:21,500
But discovering
these new desires

699
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,041
and not being able to do
anything about them--

700
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:25,542
not being able
to finish my work

701
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:28,125
not even being able
to<i> reach</i> my people...

702
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:31,375
You are making a statement
about the sanctity of life

703
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:32,875
and it will be
heard, Timicin.

704
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:36,333
Who will hear it
from light years away?

705
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:39,041
Where will I
go now, Lwaxana?

706
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,834
I'm a man without a world.

707
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:42,917
I can't go home.

708
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,417
Oh, Timicin...

709
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:49,333
RIKER:
Bridge to Dr. Timicin.

710
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:52,083
You have a visitor
coming aboard.

711
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,542
B'tardat?

712
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:55,250
No, sir,
it's your daughter.

713
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,125
Dara.
Father.

714
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,792
This is Lwaxana Troi.

715
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:11,208
She has been host
and friend.

716
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,250
I've been
looking forward

717
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,750
to meeting
you, Dara.

718
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,083
Whatever you have to say to me

719
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:21,542
can be said
in front of her.

720
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,000
I see.

721
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,333
Father, come home.

722
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,959
This is wrong.

723
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:33,041
Dara, if I could show you
the work I have begun.

724
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,458
There's still so much
for me to do.

725
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:37,166
There is nothing for me
to look at.

726
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,875
It is irrelevant.

727
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:40,000
Your father's
work

728
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,709
may save your world, my dear.

729
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:44,291
I would hardly consider that
irrelevant.

730
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:47,792
All I'm concerned with now
is you, not your work.

731
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:49,625
Your work is over.

732
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:52,542
It is your
time to rest.

733
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:54,041
LWAXANA:
Perhaps you will
feel differently

734
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,625
as you get
a little older--

735
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:58,041
say, approaching 60.

736
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:01,291
My father taught me
to cherish the Resolution.

737
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:02,959
I don't know
how you have poisoned him

738
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:04,333
to reject it.

739
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:05,792
It's an obscene ritual.

740
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:07,583
How dare you?

741
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:08,750
How dare you criticize

742
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,417
my way of life
and my beliefs?

743
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:12,417
Please, please.
Dara.

744
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:16,500
Please.

745
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:21,625
Where will you go?

746
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,333
Hmm.

747
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:25,875
I don't know.

748
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,750
And where will you die?

749
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:34,458
I cannot bear
the thought

750
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:36,583
of you being laid to rest
on some other world.

751
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:42,125
That you will not lie
beside my mother.

752
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:45,917
That I will not be able
to lie beside you

753
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:47,750
when my Resolution comes.

754
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:54,041
I'm sorry.

755
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:57,000
I don't know how you can
go on with your life

756
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,041
knowing that each day
is an insult

757
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,583
to everything we believe in.

758
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,208
(<i> sighs</i> )

759
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:09,125
Father, I love you...

760
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,166
but I am ashamed.

761
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:17,333
(<i> sobbing</i> )

762
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:42,792
I would like
to be alone now, please.

763
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

764
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:11,333
Well, I'm suddenly
not sure of myself.

765
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,625
It's a feeling
I-I'm not at all used to.

766
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:17,959
I... I don't think I like
it very much, Little One.

767
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,834
Not sure
of yourself?

768
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:25,375
My life has been full.

769
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:30,291
Oh... now and then, perhaps
it's overflowed a little, but...

770
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:33,083
but I-I enjoy living.

771
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:35,041
And now I'm asking myself

772
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:38,625
is it possible I was wrong
to encourage Timicin

773
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,500
to choose life?

774
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,959
You were honest
with him, Mother.

775
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:45,667
You had to be.

776
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:50,250
Maybe I want him to live
just to keep me company.

777
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,583
Of course, you do

778
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,417
but you didn't do
this for yourself.

779
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:56,834
You did it for him.

780
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:58,709
Did I?

781
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:03,375
Then look what I've
done to him.

782
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:04,917
He's like a...

783
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:08,250
He's like a man
who has lost his faith.

784
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:11,333
I never considered
how deeply ingrained

785
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:14,625
this Resolution liturgy is.

786
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:17,917
Ritual provides
structure in society--

787
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:20,834
good rituals and
bad rituals alike.

788
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:23,041
Well, this is a bad one.

789
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,083
Your point of view.

790
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,667
Well, it should be
the point of view

791
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:31,375
of any reasonably intelligent,
middle-aged person.

792
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:32,792
(<i> sighs</i> )

793
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:34,959
Unfortunately, it is not.

794
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,291
(<i> door chimes</i> )

795
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:49,792
I'll, uh... see
you later, Mother.

796
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:51,291
Excuse me.

797
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,667
Thank you.

798
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,834
You're going back.

799
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:04,166
Do you believe that I love you?

800
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,750
I do, you know.

801
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:20,166
But, finally,
if that is my<i> only</i> reason

802
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:22,166
to stay alive...

803
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,875
It's not enough.

804
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,458
Almost.

805
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:30,041
Almost, but not quite.

806
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:32,000
I can't be that
selfish, Lwaxana.

807
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,959
I am not the person
to lead the revolt.

808
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,041
I do apologize
for all the turmoil

809
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:56,375
that I've created.

810
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:59,959
Doctor, I would deeply regret it
if you were returning

811
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:02,208
only to ease
diplomatic tensions.

812
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,208
It is more... much more.

813
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:12,250
Then I wish you
and your people well.

814
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,333
When it is time
for another test

815
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,458
I will encourage
my people

816
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,709
to seek your
assistance again.

817
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,333
If for any reason
you would like

818
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,250
to wait for
a few minutes...

819
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,959
No, we have already
said our good-byes.

820
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:40,000
Lwaxana.

821
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,333
It is the custom
for your loved ones

822
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:46,166
to join you at this Resolution,
is it not?

823
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,583
You do not have to do this.

824
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:52,250
Yes, I do.

825
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:59,166
Permission to
disembark, Captain?

826
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,917
I promise I won't cause
any problems down there.

827
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,458
Permission granted.

828
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:22,333
We are ready,
Mr. O'Brien.
