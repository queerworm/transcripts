COMPUTER:
Welcome to Risa.

4
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,291
All that is ours is yours.

5
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,709
We are looking for
the lodging chamber

6
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,125
of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

7
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,792
A file scan reveals no record

8
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:53,166
of a Captain Picard
currently visiting Risa.

9
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,458
When is he expected
to arrive?

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,208
There is no arrival date
on file

11
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,458
for any such individual.

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,625
Could we have
been mistaken?

13
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,083
He will come.

00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:18,208
RIKER:
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 43745.2.</i>

15
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,625
<i>We have departed Gemaris V</i>
<i>where, for the past two weeks</i>

16
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,417
<i>Captain Picard</i>
<i>has been serving as mediator</i>

17
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,959
<i>in a trade dispute</i>
<i>between the Gemarians</i>

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,834
<i>and their nearest neighbor,</i>
<i>the Dachlyds.</i>

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,083
Welcome back, Deanna.

20
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,208
It's good
to be back.

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,291
The last two weeks
have been grueling.

22
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,542
I take it the Captain was able
to negotiate an agreement

23
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,333
mutually beneficial
to both parties.

24
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,625
He was.

25
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:44,208
I don't know how
he managed it.

26
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,917
The Gemarians
and the Dachlyds

27
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,166
are both incredibly
stubborn people.

28
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:52,250
The more difficult the task,
the sweeter the victory.

29
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,667
Go to warp four,
Mr. Bennett.

30
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:56,542
Set course
for Starbase 12.

31
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,792
Report.

32
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,875
Everything's
status quo, sir.

33
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:02,750
Very well.

34
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,625
If, um...

35
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:08,166
anyone needs me,
I'll be in my ready room.

36
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,750
Sir?

37
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:13,583
Congratulations.

38
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,250
About what?

39
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,875
About the trade agreement.

40
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:19,083
(<i> grunts</i> )

41
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:25,083
Is it my imagination or is
something bothering the Captain?

42
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,333
He has been under a great deal
of strain lately.

43
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:33,667
While we were on Gemaris, he ate
sparingly and slept even less.

44
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:34,875
Anything we can do?

45
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:37,750
Actually, I have
a solution in mind

46
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:40,166
but I doubt he'll agree to it.

47
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,417
What would that be?

48
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,625
Our Captain needs a vacation.

49
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:19,083
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

50
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:23,458
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,417
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

52
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,667
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

53
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,500
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

54
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:38,166
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

55

56
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,000
(<i> door chimes</i> )

57
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,083
Come!

58
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,333
Sir, it's been brought
to my attention

59
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,375
that one of the crew

60
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:56,750
is neglecting
his health again.

61
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,125
How so?

62
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,458
It's a classic case
of stress-related ailments

63
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,917
brought on by overwork--

64
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:06,333
exhaustion, irritability,
muscle spasms.

65
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,333
Yet he insists
on ignoring it.

66
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,125
It doesn't sound
too serious.

67
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,834
And I plan on keeping it
that way.

68
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,625
What's the treatment?

69
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:20,083
A week's shore leave.

70
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,333
Oh... impossible.

71
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,917
Jean-Luc, I could
make that an order.

72
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,500
But you won't.

73
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:29,542
Oh, Beverly, you know
I loathe vacations.

74
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,667
You loathe<i> going</i> on vacations.

75
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:34,667
Once you're there,
you have a marvelous time.

76
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,542
Why, you told me
that your four days

77
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,583
on Zytchin III
were wonderful.

78
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,792
I lied.

79
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,250
Look...

80
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:47,083
the<i> Enterprise</i>
is scheduled to spend a week

81
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,667
undergoing maintenance
overhaul at Starbase 12.

82
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:52,333
While there, I promise
that I will make full use

83
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,959
of available
recreational activity.

84
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,583
Watching some technician
fill deuterium tanks

85
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,333
is not my idea of fun.

86
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,834
I suppose I could find a few
hours to spend on the holodeck.

87
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,291
Oh, forget the holodeck.

88
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,417
Isn't there someplace special
you want to go?

89
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:12,417
The Astrophysics Center
on Icor IX

90
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,041
is holding a symposium
on rogue star clusters.

91
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,417
I had given serious thought

92
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,792
to attending.

93
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:21,542
The last thing you need
is serious thought.

94
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,625
Jean-Luc, why don't you go
someplace beautiful

95
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:27,458
where you can relax
and be pampered?

96
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,875
You deserve it.

97
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:31,125
I'll give it serious thought.

98
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,208
Captain...

99
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,333
Doctor... enough.

100
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:48,542
So, have you decided
where you're going yet?

101
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,250
Yes, I have, Number One.
Bridge.

102
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,875
No, I meant on
your shore leave.
Not you, too.

103
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:55,667
Halt. I know this perfect
little vacation spot.

104
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:58,208
In fact, it falls within the
coordinates of this sector.

105
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,750
How convenient,
except, Number One

106
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:02,583
I have absolutely no intention
of taking a holiday.

107
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,375
Is that clear?
Very clear.

108
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:06,333
Good. I'm glad we got that
straightened out. Resume.

109
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,959
The place is
called Risa

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,917
and believe me, Captain,
it is a paradise.

111
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,250
Warm tropical
breezes, exotic foods

112
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,875
nothing to do but sit
around all day, enjoy
the quiet and then...

113
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:16,041
the women.
The women.
Of course.

114
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,542
I'm sure you would find

115
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,625
their sybaritic outlook
on life very appealing.

116
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,166
Oh, I'm sure.

117
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm glad to hear
you say so, sir.

118
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,208
Unfortunately,
this vessel is
about to undergo

119
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,834
extensive repairs
requiring my personal
supervision.

120
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,000
What about Risa?

121
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,500
Some other time, Number One.

122
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:34,750
Will, I just had
some terrific news.

123
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:36,542
Really?

124
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,750
There's an excellent
chance that my mother
may be joining us

125
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,166
on Starbase 12.

126
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,792
Your mother?

127
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:46,000
She's returning home from
a conference on Achrady VII

128
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,250
and she's going to try
to rearrange her schedule

129
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,875
so she can spend some time
visiting with us.

130
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,375
That's wonderful, Deanna.

131
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,375
She mentioned how much
she was looking forward

132
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:55,959
to seeing you again, Captain.

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,166
Did she?

134
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,458
Commander, could I have
a word with you?

135
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,542
Is something wrong, Captain?

136
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,291
Tell me, Number One.

137
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,792
Is the entire crew aware
of this little scheme

138
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:19,709
to send me off on holiday?

139
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,625
I believe there are two ensigns
stationed on deck 39

140
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,333
who know nothing about it.

141
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:28,125
I suppose this means
I can look forward to a week

142
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,000
of continual harassment
on this subject?

143
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

144
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:42,250
I admit I have been feeling
a little fatigued.

145
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,041
I'll see to it
that these bags

146
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,125
are beamed directly
to your room, sir.

147
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,208
You look very handsome,
if I might say so, Captain.

148
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,583
Are you taking
all these books?

149
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,458
I thought I'd take
some light reading

150
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,083
in case I got bored.

151
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,041
<i>Ulysses</i> by James Joyce?

152
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,583
<i>Ethics, Sophistry and</i>
<i>the Alternate Universe.</i>

153
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,542
Ving Kuda-- you call
that light reading?

154
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,417
To each his own, Number One.

155
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,750
Have I mentioned
how imaginative

156
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,375
the Risian women
are, sir?

157
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:15,709
Too often, Commander.

158
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,125
I do have one request, sir.

159
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,792
You want me to bring you back
a souvenir?

160
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,625
It's called a<i> Horga'hn.</i>

161
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,583
I don't think you'll have
any trouble finding one.

162
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,792
Consider it done.

163
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:37,875
Captain, I would feel better
if you would allow me

164
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,583
to assign a security
officer to you.

165
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,625
We will be out of communication
range when we leave orbit.

166
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,291
(<i> sighs</i> )

167
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,542
I really don't think that will
be necessary, Mr. Worf.

168
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,959
Risa has a reputation
of being a most peaceful planet.

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,333
Aye, sir.

170
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,375
Well, the ship is yours,
Number One.

171
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,750
Enjoy your
trip, Captain.

172
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:01,875
I'll try, Counselor.

173
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:07,667
He's going to have
a great time.

174
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,500
(<i> people talking, laughing</i> )

175
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:22,291
(<i> birds singing</i> )

176
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,709
Oh... I beg your pardon.

177
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,041
God, it's so good
to see you again.

178
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,792
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

179
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:04,625
You know, I think
you might be right.

180
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,417
Welcome to Risa.

181
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,875
A simple handshake
would have sufficed.

182
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,709
(<i> woman laughing</i> )

183
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,625
(<i> women squealing</i>
<i>with laughter</i> )

184
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,834
(<i> people talking, laughing</i> )

185
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,834
(<i> sighs</i> )

186
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:05,041
(<i> ball humming</i> )

187
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,291
(<i> humming</i> )

188
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,417
WOMAN:
Return.

189
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,250
My apologies.

190
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:21,333
I fear I have yet to master
the art of hoverball.

191
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,417
So it would seem.

192
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,917
My name is Joval.

193
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,083
I'm employed here.

194
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,709
Is there anything
you require

195
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,333
to make your stay
a more pleasant one?

196
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,792
You find me amusing.

197
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,000
No.

198
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,667
It's just that you are
the fifth woman

199
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,458
to ask me that question
this morning.

200
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,834
All I require is to sit
in the sun, read my book...

201
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,500
alone.

202
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:48,333
And afterward?

203
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,208
I really hadn't thought
that far ahead.

204
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,792
Then, may I suggest a swim,
followed by a massage.

205
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:58,583
Some other time, perhaps.

206
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,375
I don't understand.

207
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:02,458
You say you wish
to be alone

208
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,542
yet, you carry the<i> Horga'hn.</i>

209
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,250
Well, I just purchased it.

210
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,166
Why?

211
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,834
Are you implying this has
some special meaning?

212
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:17,250
The<i> Horga'hn</i> is the Risian
symbol of sexuality.

213
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,542
To own one
is to call forth its powers.

214
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,500
To display it is to announce
you are seeking<i> jamaharon.</i>

215
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,500
Riker.

216
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,500
Do you seek<i> jamaharon?</i>

217
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:33,667
I don't even know what it means.

218
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,125
The<i> Horga'hn</i> is for a friend.

219
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,208
I see.
Someone close to you.

220
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,166
That's right.

221
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,333
Someone you love.

222
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,875
I wouldn't go that far.

223
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:44,500
Well, your attitude
is most puzzling.

224
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:47,041
I will leave you
now to your book.

225
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,250
That is all I ask.

226
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,458
You're blocking the suns.

227
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,291
I know you're working with her.

228
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,208
I warn you, it's a mistake.

229
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:22,500
Are you addressing me?

230
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,375
Don't bother to deny it.

231
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:26,500
I've seen the two
of you together.

232
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,583
I don't know what the devil
you're talking about.

233
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,667
But, whatever it is, I assure
you, it's no concern of mine.

234
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:36,000
Tell her I want the disk
returned to me immediately.

235
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,375
Perhaps I have not
made myself clear.

236
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:41,250
You have the wrong man.

237
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:55,250
I am rapidly losing patience
with you.

238
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,417
I demand you
talk business.

239
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:02,250
You'll find Ferengi demands
carry little weight with me.

240
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:06,667
Obviously, you've never dealt
with my people before.

241
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:07,917
(<i> chuckles</i> )

242
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,875
On the contrary.
All too often.

243
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:14,250
Then, you know the Ferengi
are not to be trifled with.

244
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,583
Or trusted.

245
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:19,625
You dare to insult me?!

246
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:30,417
I advise you to listen closely,
for I will not say this again.

247
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,333
I came to Risa for a holiday,
nothing more.

248
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,208
I have no knowledge
of this woman of whom you speak

249
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,208
nor have I set eyes on any disk.

250
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,542
(<i> laughs</i> )

251
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,458
You expect me
to believe such
feeble lies?

252
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,709
I don't care what you believe!

253
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,917
This is not
over yet, human.

254
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,417
The disk is mine!

255
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,542
And so is the woman.

256
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,625
Remember that.

257
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,458
WOMAN:
Hello.

258
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,959
Oh, it's you.

259
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,875
Well, that's not much
of a greeting.

260
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,500
Look, I don't wish
to appear rude

261
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:29,625
but I am not seeking
<i>jamaharon.</i>

262
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,709
All right.

263
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,500
But you really should try it
sometime.

264
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:37,959
If I try it
it will be

265
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,542
at a time
of my own choosing.

266
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,917
That's fine with me.

267
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,333
It's not as though I was
offering to help you find it.

268
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:53,917
Uh... I, uh...

269
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,667
I assumed that

270
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:57,041
because of the way you
welcomed me the other day...

271
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,041
I'm sorry

272
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,458
if I embarrassed you.

273
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,500
I don't recall
saying I was embarrassed.

274
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,458
It's just that I prefer
to be acquainted

275
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,375
with the women that I kiss.

276
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,625
That's understandable.

277
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,125
The name's Vash.

278
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,291
Jean-Luc Picard.

279
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,166
So tell me about yourself,
Jean-Luc.

280
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,959
(<i> sighs heavily</i> )

281
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,583
Would you rather I guess?

282
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,458
I can be
very persistent.

283
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,375
I'm the Captain
of a Federation starship.

284
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:32,250
Oh...

285
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,875
That explains it.

286
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,250
Explains what?

287
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,750
I noticed you arguing
with that Ferengi.

288
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,208
For a moment there

289
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,583
it looked like it was going
to come to blows.

290
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,417
You're the woman
he was talking about.

291
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,667
I hope your disagreement
wasn't over me.

292
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:52,667
For that information,
you'll have to ask him.

293
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,583
Where are you going?

294
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,458
To find some privacy.
Wait a second.

295
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,166
What did he tell you?
I bet there wasn't
a bit of truth to it.

296
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,083
And you said you
didn't know her.

297
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,834
I don't.
And I don't want to.

298
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,500
Return the disk to me
and all will be forgiven.

299
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:10,959
The disk doesn't belong
to you, Sovak-- it never did.

300
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,959
It would seem the two of you
have a lot to discuss.

301
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,959
If you will excuse me.

302
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,667
Jean-Luc, I'm sorry.

303
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:18,041
Perhaps I could explain
all this to you later?

304
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,500
Perhaps you can.

305
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:23,333
I have a proposal

306
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,000
I believe you'll find
most interesting.

307
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,667
Save your breath.

308
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:29,667
I'm willing to pay you
your weight in gold

309
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,375
in exchange for the disk.

310
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,959
Is that not a generous offer?

311
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:42,208
Oh... I must have that woman.

312
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:53,291
What the hell
are you doing in my room?

313
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,875
We are Vorgons.

314
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,500
I am Ajur.

315
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,375
This is Boratus.

316
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,709
We come from
the 27th century.

317
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,250
We traveled 300
years into the past

318
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,000
to find you.

319
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,709
All right, let's assume for the
moment that I believe you.

320
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,417
That you are, indeed,
from the future.

321
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,250
What is it
you want from me?

322
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,709
Have you heard of the<i> Tox Uthat?</i>

323
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,208
What?

324
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,792
I'm aware of the legend.

325
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:31,625
It tells of a visitor...
from the future

326
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:36,458
who left behind a mysterious
device known as the<i> Tox Uthat.</i>

327
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,083
Essentially that story
is correct.

328
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,333
Then the<i> Uthat</i> actually exists?

329
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:47,625
Yes. It was invented by
a scientist named Kal Dano

330
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,458
in the mid-27th century.

331
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,333
The<i> Uthat</i> is a quantum
phase inhibitor

332
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:56,083
capable of halting all
nuclear reaction within a star.

333
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:07,125
But... why bring such
a powerful weapon into the past?

334
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,250
Criminals attempted
to steal the device

335
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,208
so he fled back
to the 22nd century,
where he hid it.

336
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,041
Ajur and I were
the security team

337
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,000
assigned to
retrieve the<i> Uthat.</i>

338
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,834
I gather you were unsuccessful.

339
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,834
Yes.
When we returned

340
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,208
we began to search
through the historical records

341
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,875
for some clue
to the<i> Uthat's</i> fate.

342
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,709
And your search led you to me?

343
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,625
We came upon a brief account
stating that you had discovered

344
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:33,041
an object of unknown origin
while vacationing in Risa.

345
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,750
From its description--

346
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:36,959
a crystal fitting
into the palm of the hand--

347
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,875
we surmised it could
very well be the<i> Tox Uthat.</i>

348
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:44,417
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you

349
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:48,125
but I haven't found anything,
including peace

350
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,333
which is the only thing
I'm looking for.

351
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,125
You<i> will</i> find
such a device, Captain.

352
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,041
To us, it is already
part of history.

353
00:20:56,083 --> 00:21:00,709
And, uh, if I find it,
what then?

354
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,750
You will give it to us
immediately

355
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,500
so that we may return with it.

356
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:10,583
Well, the<i> Uthat</i> belongs
to your time, not mine.

357
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,375
(<i> buzzing whir</i> )

358
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:39,959
May I come in?

359
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,750
Excuse the mess.

360
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:47,375
Sovak has taken to searching
my room periodically.

361
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,625
This what he's
looking for?

362
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:52,959
I'm sorry I had
to hide it like that.

363
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,208
I was afraid he'd start
searching me next.

364
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,041
This disk must contain some
very valuable information.

365
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,125
Well, I doubt it's anything
you'd be interested in.

366
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,583
Depends.

367
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,834
On what?

368
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,208
On whether or not

369
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,709
it has something to do
with the<i> Tox Uthat.</i>

370
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,208
Did Sovak tell you that?

371
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,709
Well, let's
just say

372
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,083
I've heard... rumors

373
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:27,041
that the<i> Uthat</i> is located
somewhere on Risa.

374
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,750
Look, the last thing I need
is a partner.

375
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,500
So it's true.

376
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,583
Have a seat.

377
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:41,583
I don't suppose you ever heard
of Professor Samuel Estragon?

378
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,500
Yes, as a matter
of fact, I have.

379
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:46,250
He spent half his life searching
for the<i> Tox Uthat.</i>

380
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,000
I served
as his personal assistant

381
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,709
for the past five years.

382
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,417
Shortly before he died,
he uncovered new data

383
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,041
pinpointing its location

384
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:58,583
and that disk contains
his research notes and maps.

385
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:02,000
And you're continuing his work.

386
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,208
Exactly.

387
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,834
With a Ferengi as an associate?

388
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:09,208
Sovak and I definitely are not
working together.

389
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,458
But the two
of you

390
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,417
are... very well acquainted.

391
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,500
Well, at times

392
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:18,959
he aided the professor
in his explorations.

393
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,667
Especially in situations
that weren't quite ethical.

394
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:26,166
And now with typical
Ferengi logic

395
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,875
he's convinced that
the<i> Tox Uthat</i> belongs to him.

396
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:31,583
All he cares about is selling it
to the highest bidder.

397
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:35,417
Whereas you, of course,
have a nobler purpose in mind.

398
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,250
I told the professor
I'd present it

399
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,125
to the Daystrom
Institute for study.

400
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,250
Ah.

401
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,125
But, first, I have
to find it

402
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,709
and that won't be easy with
Sovak watching me every minute.

403
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,125
I'll go in your place.

404
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,250
And what about me?

405
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,458
You remain here.

406
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,542
It's safer.

407
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,875
Is that an order?

408
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:01,375
Absolutely.

409
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:04,583
This isn't a starship, Jean-Luc.

410
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,000
I don't follow orders.

411
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,542
Oh, I see.

412
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,542
Besides, you'd never
find it without me.

413
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,917
The professor's notes
are in code.

414
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,667
From the moment I met you

415
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,458
I knew you were going
to be trouble.

416
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,834
You look like a man
who could handle trouble.

417
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:27,667
So, where exactly
is the location?

418
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:30,333
It's about 27 kilometers
due east.

419
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,125
There's some subterranean
caves there.

420
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,667
That's where you'll
find the<i> Uthat.</i>

421
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:37,375
I'll meet you in the lobby
in 15 minutes.

422
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:38,875
Be punctual.

423
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:43,792
Oh, and, uh, I advise you
to change your clothing.

424
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:46,417
Jean-Luc?

425
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:49,959
We're going to make
a wonderful team.

426
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,458
(<i> people talking, laughing</i> )

427
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,667
(<i> birds singing</i> )

428
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,375
I expected such treachery.

429
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:09,375
Did you think
you could sneak
away from me

430
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:11,291
so easily?

431
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,333
The disk-- where is it?

432
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,500
Didn't anyone tell you weapons
aren't allowed on Risa?

433
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:24,709
You're making a grave mistake

434
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,375
putting your trust
in this woman.

435
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,000
It would be a worse mistake
to trust you.

436
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,625
Silence!

437
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:33,792
Do you know how she acquired
the disk in the first place?

438
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:34,709
Sovak!

439
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,375
(<i> laughing</i> )

440
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:41,125
I paid her to steal it.

441
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,208
But instead,
she betrayed me

442
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,583
and used my money
to make her way here.

443
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:47,959
It didn't happen that way.

444
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,375
She's a greedy
and unscrupulous woman.

445
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:55,750
(<i> sighing</i> )

446
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:58,709
A perfect mate for a Ferengi.

447
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,750
You're becoming quite annoying,
Sovak.

448
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,333
As are you, human.

449
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,333
Perhaps I should kill you

450
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,875
and then take the disk.

451
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:08,083
No, wait.

452
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,125
You can have it.

453
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,291
See, I told you we'd
make a wonderful team.

454
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,291
We've got a long trip.

455
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:45,083
(<i> device beeping</i> )

456
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:54,333
Have you calculated
how much further we have to go?

457
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,667
Another 11 kilometers.

458
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,625
We should stay here
for the night.

459
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:02,625
I was hoping

460
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,041
you'd say that.

461
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:09,000
Actually, we've...

462
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:12,000
we've made better time
than I expected.

463
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:14,208
Well, I'll take that
as a compliment.

464
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,458
As it was intended.

465
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

466
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:35,208
Jean-Luc...

467
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,875
I'm afraid I haven't been
completely honest with you.

468
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:40,750
Forgive me
if I don't act surprised.

469
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:47,458
Sovak did pay me
to hand over the disk.

470
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,834
So you did steal it.

471
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,875
It wasn't stealing.

472
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,250
The professor had died.

473
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,250
I had already spent
five years of my life

474
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:57,166
tracking down the<i> Uthat.</i>

475
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,792
But you took Sovak's money.

476
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:02,875
It was the only way
I could afford to get to Risa.

477
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:06,792
As for Sovak, he got
exactly what he deserved.

478
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:12,792
Well, any woman who can
beat a Ferengi at his own game

479
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,667
bears watching.

480
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:19,375
I'll take that
as another compliment.

481
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:22,166
I'm flattered.

482
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,166
Hmm. Well...

483
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,792
we should get some sleep.

484
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:38,542
You know, Jean-Luc, it's
lucky for you we met.

485
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,667
If it wasn't for me...

486
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:42,333
If it wasn't for me

487
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:46,667
you'd still be back there
sitting in the sun, relaxing.

488
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:49,625
That happens to be
why I came to Risa.

489
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:52,458
I'm sure you hated
every minute of it.

490
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,208
That kind of vacation
isn't for a man like you.

491
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,208
You need excitement.

492
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,458
Excitement?

493
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,500
Spending the night
in a damp cave

494
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:03,834
chasing after something we
shall probably never find?

495
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,834
You're enjoying yourself,
aren't you?

496
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,250
Ah.

497
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,125
Yes.

498
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,875
I just wanted
to hear you say it.

499
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:17,875
Good, now let's
get some sleep.

(<i> chuckles</i> )

501
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:46,041
I'll never forget that look
on your face

when you thought I was
offering you<i> jamaharon.</i>

503
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:52,083
Now, that was a simple
misunderstanding.

504
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,125
Oh.

506
00:29:59,709 --> 00:30:02,083
You did seem
a little disappointed

when I turned you down.

You're pretty stimulating
yourself.

We're a lot alike.

514
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,500
That's probably why
we get along so well.

00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:26,792
You call this
getting along?

516
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:29,583
Fine.

00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,417
We don't get along.
We're not getting along.

518
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,041
I didn't say that.

519
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:37,166
No, no. If you want to believe
that we're not getting along

520
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,083
that's all
right with me...

You still think
I'm trouble?

00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,083
(<i> sighs</i> )

534
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,667
I can't get a reading on this.

535
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:03,000
There must be Starithium ore
in these rocks.

536
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:06,625
And that leaves us
but one alternative.

537
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,166
Shall we?

538
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,375
Picard!

539
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,542
A little premature,
aren't we?

540
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:36,417
We are to be a witness
to a great moment, Picard.

541
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:39,667
Who the hell are they?

542
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,959
They are...

543
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,875
security officers
from the 27th century.

544
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:48,208
They're here to take back the
<i>Uthat.</i>

545
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:52,625
You knew about this
and didn't say anything?

546
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:54,917
I'm sorry, Vash.

547
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:57,375
Would you have brought me here
if I had told you?

548
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,750
Probably not.

549
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:02,458
My point exactly.

550
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,542
SOVAK:
So, the betrayer

551
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,208
is herself betrayed.

552
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,208
Well, you've put together
quite a little team.

553
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,834
Do not interrupt the Captain.

554
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,792
SOVAK:
Quiet!

555
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:14,583
PICARD:
How did you get here?

556
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,041
SOVAK:
I found the disk in her room.

557
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,375
That's impossible.

558
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:21,291
I made a copy
as a precaution

559
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,709
but I burned it
before we left.

560
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,709
Ah... only the outer casing
was incinerated.

561
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,625
Now, I had no intention
of interrupting you.

562
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:32,250
Please,<i> continue digging!</i>

563
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:46,250
(<i> laughing</i> )

564
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,875
(<i> grunting</i> )

565
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,458
No one told you
to stop digging, human.

566
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,625
I see no reason
to continue.

567
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,291
You will do as I say.

568
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,375
Look about you, Sovak.

569
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:17,375
By now it must be
obvious, even to you.

570
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:19,208
The<i> Uthat</i> is not here.

571
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,625
(<i> Sovak cackling</i> )

572
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:21,792
Is this

573
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:24,583
some pathetic attempt
at trickery?

574
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:26,000
Of course, it's here.

575
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:28,458
We simply haven't
found it yet.

576
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,250
Are you saying that the
professor's findings were wrong?

577
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:34,291
It would appear so.

578
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,458
But how can that be?

579
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,583
His evidence
was overwhelming.

580
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,083
Enough with this foolishness!

581
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:42,000
Can't you see
he's trying to deceive us?

582
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:44,458
Return to work this instant.

583
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,583
I'm afraid he's right, Sovak.

584
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:51,750
According to the disk, we should
have reached it hours ago.

585
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,041
Lies!

586
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:55,083
Treachery!

587
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,959
This cannot be happening.

588
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,583
Not another failure.

589
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:01,041
Not after having come so close.

590
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:03,041
It is most puzzling.

591
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,166
(<i> buzzing whir</i> )

592
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:17,125
It's over, Sovak.

593
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:20,875
No, I will not be cheated
out of my prize.

594
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:22,291
Tell him!

595
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,709
Tell him the professor's
research is irrefutable.

596
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,333
I don't know anymore.

597
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,792
Then step aside.

598
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:41,041
The<i> Uthat</i> is here, somewhere.

599
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:44,208
It's just waiting to be found.

600
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,625
It can't hide
from me forever.

601
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,458
(<i> panting</i> )

602
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:05,083
Five years of my life wasted.

603
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:13,750
There will be
other treasures

604
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:16,041
to be found, Vash.

605
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,709
Not like the<i> Uthat.</i>

606
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,000
I hope you won't mind,
but, um...

607
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,875
I need to be alone.

608
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:59,667
(<i> birds calling</i> )

609
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:07,625
RIKER:
<i>Enterprise</i> to Captain Picard.

610
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:09,291
Picard here.

611
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,125
Go ahead, Commander.

612
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:13,667
We hope we're not interrupting
anything important, Captain

613
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,041
but we wanted to inform you

614
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:17,208
that we have achieved orbit
around Risa

615
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,959
and we're ready to beam you
aboard at your convenience.

616
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,041
I'll be returning shortly,
Commander.

617
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,208
In the interim, stand ready

618
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:28,208
to initiate Transporter Code 14
at my signal.

619
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,500
Transporter Code 14?

620
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,166
You heard me, Number One.

621
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,291
Yes, sir.

622
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,542
Picard out.

623
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:53,458
PICARD:
Leaving so soon?

624
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,250
Jean-Luc.

625
00:37:56,291 --> 00:38:00,291
I was just about
to come say good-bye.

626
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:07,750
Well, then... I've
saved you the bother.

627
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:13,667
I want to put this all behind me
as soon as possible.

628
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,542
You understand?

629
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:18,750
Of course.

630
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:21,625
There's just one last
thing you can do for me.

631
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:23,583
Anything.

632
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,333
Tell me where you've
hidden the<i> Tox Uthat.</i>

633
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,000
That's not funny.

634
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:34,291
You never intended to
burn that second disk.

635
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:36,458
If you had, you wouldn't
have been so careless

636
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,709
as to allow Sovak
to salvage any of it.

637
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,875
You wanted him
to follow us

638
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:43,166
so that he could
see for himself

639
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:47,250
that the<i> Uthat</i> wasn't
at the cave site.

640
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,834
That was the only way
he could be convinced

641
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:52,208
that your quest
had been futile.

642
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,417
But how could I have known
the<i> Uthat</i> wasn't there?

643
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,125
Because you had already
been there once before.

644
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:01,750
Probably the moment you
arrived on the planet.

645
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:04,250
That's when you found it.

646
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:14,542
You're a man
of many talents, Jean-Luc.

647
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:34,250
A piece of the future.

648
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,041
A very dangerous piece.

649
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:53,000
Were you really
going to give this

650
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,583
to the Daystrom Institute?

651
00:39:55,625 --> 00:40:01,583
Well, maybe not<i> give</i> it.

652
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:05,583
Five years is
a huge investment, Jean-Luc.

653
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:08,667
I deserve to make
a reasonable profit.

654
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,583
Congratulations,
Picard.

655
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:16,250
We knew you
would not fail us.

656
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,625
You're not going to just
hand it over, are you?

657
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,041
You didn't trust me.

658
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,625
What makes you think
you can trust them?

659
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:26,250
I assume the Vorgons have proof
to back up their claim.

660
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,375
Our being here
is proof enough.

661
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,542
Wait a second, Vorgons?

662
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:34,583
The professor's notes said
that it was two Vorgons

663
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:35,959
a male and a female,
who attempted

664
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,208
to steal the<i> Uthat</i>
in the first place.

665
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,083
For all we know,
it could be them.

666
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,750
You, uh... You're going
to have to prove

667
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,250
that you are
who you say you are.

668
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:49,542
You yourself said

669
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,583
the<i> Uthat</i> belongs
to the future.

670
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:53,500
But not necessarily to you.

671
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:56,417
You will return
what is ours.

672
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:57,500
No!

673
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,083
<i>Enterprise,</i> Code 14.

674
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:04,291
Lock onto present coordinates,
two-second delay.

675
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:05,583
Mark!

676
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,166
Are you all right?

677
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:18,166
Go.

678
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,417
Return
to your own time.

679
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:22,291
There's nothing for you here.

680
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,875
History recorded
that<i> you</i> destroyed the<i> Uthat.</i>

681
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:31,250
You have fulfilled
your destiny all
too well, Picard.

682
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,792
(<i> buzzing whir</i> )

683
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,291
I don't suppose
there are any openings

684
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:58,709
for an archaeologist
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

685
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:07,083
Somehow I doubt you'd find
life aboard a starship

686
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,291
suitable to your taste.

687
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:14,750
Probably not.

688
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:17,291
I could never tolerate
all that discipline.

689
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,834
Oh...

690
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,291
So...

691
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:32,667
What are your plans?

692
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:36,125
I thought I might explore
the ruins on Sarthong V.

693
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,083
Oh! Unbelievable!

694
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:42,917
You are out of your mind.

695
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:46,792
The Sarthongians are merciless
to trespassers.

696
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:52,375
Why, Jean-Luc...

697
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:55,750
you really do care about me.

698
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:02,917
Promise me you will try
and stay out of trouble.

699
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:06,375
I always try.

700
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:23,083
I wish we had more time
together.

701
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,583
Well, perhaps we do.

702
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:29,166
The Vorgons are time travelers.

703
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:34,834
Now they know where and when
the<i> Uthat</i> can be found

704
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:38,959
they may very well come back
and try for it again.

705
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:45,959
So we may be doing this
all over again.

706
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:56,208
Welcome aboard, Captain.

707
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,959
Status report,
Number One.

708
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,959
All went well
on Starbase 12.

709
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,041
I think you'll find the ship
in splendid condition.

710
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:04,041
I'll present my compliments
to the crew.

711
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:06,542
Oh, yes, Number One

712
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:09,208
about that<i> Horga'hn</i>
you requested.

713
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,875
Yes, sir?

714
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:13,583
You and I need to have
a little chat about that.

715
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:17,291
Was it a relaxing
trip, Captain?

716
00:44:19,959 --> 00:44:22,583
Uh-huh.

717
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,625
