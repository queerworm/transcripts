<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44085.7.</i>

2
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:06,667
<i>Due to a medical emergency</i>

3
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:08,166
<i>we have been forced</i>
<i>to cut short</i>

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,250
<i>a two-day liberty on Ogus II</i>

5
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:13,333
<i>and set course</i>
<i>for Starbase 416.</i>

6
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,291
<i>It seems a young man's</i>
<i>practical joke</i>

7
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,375
<i>has come dangerously close</i>
<i>to a lethal conclusion.</i>

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,625
Well, Mr. Potts.

9
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:34,083
Why don't we start
at the beginning?

10
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,917
We were at the arcade, sir

11
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:37,417
an-and I brought
this balloon with me

12
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,250
filled with red pillion dye.

13
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,625
You see, Willie's always
making fun of me.

14
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:41,667
I figured I'd
get him back...

15
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,583
Hey, hey,
slow down.

16
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,750
We programmed the game
for an ordinary laser duel.

17
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,667
You know, 21 points.

18
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:52,750
Four points for...

19
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:54,458
Yes, I'm familiar with the game.

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,917
Go on.

21
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,667
We went out to the forest
behind the east arcade.

22
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:01,750
I told Willie that his laser
pistol looked kind of funny

23
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:03,750
almost like a real one.

24
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:05,166
When I went behind the trees

25
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,542
I put the balloon into my vest,
and then...

26
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,208
And then you made
your nine-year-old brother

27
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,125
believe that he'd killed you.

28
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,917
Yes, sir.

29
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,875
And then he ran away?

30
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:16,917
Yes, sir.

31
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,041
And while he was hiding,

32
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,667
he ate the fruit of
a cove palm.

33
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:20,959
It was just a joke, sir.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,375
I didn't think
this was going to happen.

35
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,417
Are you aware
of the infectious nature

36
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:27,500
of the parasites
which inhabit the cove palm?

37
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:28,709
I-I am now, sir.

38
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,333
Are you also familiar
with the terms

39
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,125
that I agreed to keep you
boys on the<i> Enterprise</i> 

40
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,875
when your parents
went on sabbatical?

41
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:37,792
Tha-That we'd stay
out of trouble, sir.

42
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:39,208
Mr. Data?

43
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,750
DATA:
On my way, sir.

44
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:44,583
Think about it, Mr. Potts.

45
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,583
And while you're at it think
about what may have happened

46
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,458
had we not been this close
to a Starbase medical facility.

47
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,125
Were you able to contact
the boys' parents?

48
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,333
They have been
made fully aware of
the situation, sir.

49
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:00,834
RIKER:
Good... Escort this young man
to the quarantine anteroom.

50
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,166
Perhaps he could assist us

51
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,333
in lifting
his brother's spirits.

52
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,834
Aye, sir.

53
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,875
H-He really could die.

54
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,458
Fortunately

55
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,542
we are only two days
away from Starbase 416

56
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,125

58
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,000
Can isolate what, sir?

59
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,208
Their laboratory can
isolate what, Commander?

60
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,625
Sir, I know I
made a mistake

61
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,458
and I can tell
you're angry

62
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,250
but if you're not
going to talk to me...

69
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,041
Back so soon, Mr. Data?

70
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,083
La Forge to Bridge.

71
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,792
PICARD:
Go ahead, Commander.

72
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:51,458
Captain, we've completed our
dilithium vector calibrations.

73
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,750
We are currently at warp 4.5.

74
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,917
You're clear to increase
to warp seven.

75
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,917
Very good, Geordi.

76
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,291
Let me know if you...

77
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,917
Captain, did you
request a course
correction?

78
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,375
I didn't say we could
increase speed to warp 9.1, sir.

79
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:06,875
New course set
for heading 341 mark 221.

80
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:08,125
Course set by whom?

81
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,041
Not by me, Commander.

82
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,583
What's going on?

83
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,667
Data, who programmed
the new coordinates?

84
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,000
WESLEY:
Warp 9.3, Commander.

85
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,041
LA FORGE:
I don't advise this, Captain.

86
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,000
If we're going to maintain
our realignment progressions

87
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,959
we shouldn't be pushing warp
eight for at least an hour.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,333
Commander.

89
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,625

Our velocity is holding
steady at warp 9.3.

104
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,500
Do you wish to
override, Commander?

105
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,917
No, not yet.

106
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,458
Computer, isolate cause
of life-support failure.

107
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,458
Atmosphere conditioning pumps
on deck one

108
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,125
are operating in negative mode.

109
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,750
How can that be?
There are seven independent

110
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:26,500
safety interlocks to
prevent that.

111
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:28,750
Captain, I believe
we've found the problem

112
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,375
but it really doesn't
make sense.

113
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:31,792
Bring the<i> Enterprise</i>
to a full stop, Commander.

114
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,458
Aye, sir.
Full stop, Ensign.

115
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,000
It's not responding, sir.

116
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,125
I'm going to have to do this
at a manual input level, sir.

117
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,458
Wes.

118
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,333
We're still at the altered
heading, Captain.

Computer, locate
Lieutenant Commander Data.

124
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:57,083
Commander Data
is on the Main Bridge.

125
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,542
What the hell
is he up to?

126
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,667
Number One, take a security team
up to deck two.

127
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,333
Try and break through
from below.

129
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,000
Everything's locked up, Captain.

139
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,333
Maintain minimum auxiliary power

140
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,166
and disengage
subspace communication.

141
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,458
Acknowledged.

142
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,875

I am aware of the risks, Ensign.

147
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:56,083
When the umbilical splits

148
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,792
we should regain
primary control.

149
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,125
Do you agree?

150
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,875
Yes, sir.

151
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:03,208
The saucer module should fall
out of warp within two minutes.

152
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,125
Be prepared to sweep back

153
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,625
and pull it in
with a tractor beam.

154
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:08,041
Aye, sir.

170
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,709
And just what location
are they accepted from?

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,917
Interface terminals

You're the only one
who has clearance

173

to localize
command functions.

174
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,208
It seems Commander Data
has acquired it as well.

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,583
J14-Baker backs onto Science
Station Two, Commander.

179
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,834
Have they re-inverted

180
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,000
the environmental
control sequencer?

181
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,667
Yes, sir. Life-support
has been re-established.

182
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,333
Then you and Casey
get up here.

183
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,750
Let's get to it.

184
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,625
(<i> in normal voice</i> ):
Computer, configure
a perimeter field charge

185
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:35,375
sections 9-K through 12-T.

186
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:36,834
(<i> electronic buzzing</i> )

187
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,417
RIKER:
What the hell was that?

188
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,875
WORF:
He's activated
a force field, sir.

189
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:43,458
RIKER:
Great. Just great.

190
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,792
Chief O'Brien.
Yes, Captain?

191
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:47,917
We had better disable the site
to site transporter function.

192
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,291
When we get wherever we're going

193
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,500
I don't want Mr. Data
beaming off the Bridge.

194
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:53,709
I'll get right to it, sir.

195
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,583
Doctor Crusher?

196
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,583
Yes, Captain.

197
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,834
Is your quarantine intact?

198
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,083
So far, Sick Bay force fields

199
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,917
don't seem
to have been affected.

200
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,041
The boy?

201
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,792
He's all right.

202
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:08,041
But he's not going
to stay all right.

203
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,583
Sir, we have to get this ship
to a Starbase medical facility.

204
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,083
It seems, Doctor
that Mr. Data

205
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:17,083
has other plans
for the<i> Enterprise</i> right now.

206
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,583
Oh, come on, I
can't believe that.

207
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,000
Everybody's played
a practical joke

208
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,458
on somebody at one
time or another.

209
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,000
Not me.

210
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,834
Not even a little one?

211
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,917
How about April Fools'?

212
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,291
I can't believe that
you're telling me

213
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,917
that you've never tried
to pull something

214
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,542
even on April Fools' Day?

215
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,875
What for?

216
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:43,375
It's never funny
to the one getting fooled.

217
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:44,750
Well, I'm sure
your brother didn't intend

218
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:49,250
for it to get
this out of hand.

219
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,417
Certainly not to
the degree it has.

220
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,125
Take a deep breath.

221
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,125
What's so funny about making
someone think you killed them?

222
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,458
Take a deep breath.

223
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,166
Have you been
drinking all the
water I asked you to?

224
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,250
Yes.

225
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,375
Well, keep it up.

226
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,625
There might be
a slight delay

227
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,667
in reaching Starbase,
and I want...

228
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,208
There. You see?

229
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,417
How can I tell him when he's
not going to listen to me?

230
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,625
Why don't you try, Jake?

231
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,667
It's just a waste
of time.

232
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:22,083
He won't listen.

233
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:45,709
Computer, prepare
to transport me directly

234
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,667
to the following coordinates.

235
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,417
Site-to-site
transport interlocks

236
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,166
have been manually deactivated.

237
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,208
Can you override?

238
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,792
Negative.

239
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:00,417
Show me the shortest route
to Transporter Room One.

240
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:09,333
Computer, prepare to activate
cascade force field sequence

241
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,375
in the following progression.

242
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:18,333
LA FORGE:
No matter what we try
the computer

243
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,875
will only accept
commands from the Bridge, sir.

244
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:22,917
He has blocked every
subspace channel, sir.

245
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,458
We cannot even
call for help.

246
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,333
Have you tried tracing back
navigation inputs?

247
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,000
We don't even know what
star system we're in, sir.

248
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,667
The only way we knew
we'd come out of warp

249
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,667
was by looking
out a window.

250
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,291
O'Brien to Captain Picard.

251
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,375
Go ahead, Chief.

252
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,417
Captain, he's up to something.

253
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,792
What now?

254
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,125
He discovered
the site-to-site lockout.

255
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,333
I wouldn't be surprised
if he tried to

256
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,291
make it to
a transporter room now.

257
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,208
Mr. Worf, I want security teams
along all the main passageways

258
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,333
and in every transporter room.

259
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,709
And see if the computer
will be good enough

260
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,583
to give us
the precise stun setting

261
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,834
to disable Mr. Data.

262
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,417
Yes, sir.

263
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,750
Computer, estimate the time
from this location

264
00:12:57,792 --> 00:13:00,625
to Starbase 416 at warp nine.

265
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,625
Inquiries regarding
command functions

266
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:05,542
are no longer accepted
from your present location.

267
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,917
(<i> in Picard's voice):</i>

previously transferred
to Bridge.

270
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,500
Enter code.

accepting instructions
from Commander Data en route...

277
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,083
now.

278
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,583

He's out.

282
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,333
I order you to stop!

283

Computer

284
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,083
begin scan-phase.

285
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:32,417
No, no, it's too close.

286
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,792
This has gone
far enough, Data.

287
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:44,250
Computer, three-meter
cross-seal.

288
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,750
I wouldn't
advise that, sir.

289
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:48,542
The phase coils don't take well
to ricochets.

290
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,750
What's he doing?

291
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:58,500
He's reactivating the site-
to-site transport interlocks.

292
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,041
Does that mean
he'll be able to...?

293
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,333
(<i> insects chirping,</i>
<i>birds calling</i> )

294

Uh-huh.

299
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,792
You're right on time.

300
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,166
Open.

301
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,959
One of these...

(<i> ratcheting clicks</i> )

303
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,709

There... you... are.

305
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,875
I fail to recall
how I arrived here.

306
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,917
I sent for you.

307
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,917
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
In a manner of speaking.

308
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,125
And who are you, sir?

309
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,667
(<i> laughing</i> )

310
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,000

311
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,000
<i>Enterprise,</i> do you read me?

312
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:21,667
I always loved
that face.

313
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,917
Please, sit down.

314
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,083
We were headed
for a medical facility.

315
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,959
I was taking the boy's brother
to Sick Bay, and...

316
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,250
I'm sure
your starship

317
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,834
will be back for you soon.

318
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,709
Please, sit down.

319
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,166
I must find a way
to contact the<i> Enterprise.</i>

320
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:51,250
Tell me

321
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:55,542
do I look somewhat,
uh... familiar to you?

322
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:00,375
You do bear a resemblance

323
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:03,542
to Dr. Noonien Soong,
the cyberneticist who...

324
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,792
(<i> chuckling</i> )

325
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,417
who constructed me.

326
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:10,667
But Dr. Soong was killed
shortly afterward

327
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,291
by the Crystalline Entity.

328
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,458
Ah, there we are.

329
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,250
This is your lucky day, Data.

330
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:28,500
You found your long lost father,
and he's alive.

331
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:31,083
What do you think of that?

332
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,208
But the colony was destroyed.

333
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,875
There were no survivors.

334
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:37,083
I, uh...

335
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,166
I never felt too comfortable

336
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:45,417
living anywhere without
a pre-arranged route of escape.

337
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,250
I admit, I, uh...

338
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,625
I wouldn't have guessed

339
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:51,333
I'd be running
from a giant snowflake, but...

340
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,041
It is really you.

341
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:06,875
LA FORGE:
Captain

342
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,625
the quarantine field
in Sick Bay.

343
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,291
You have
access to it?

344
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,208
When he transferred force field
control to the Bridge

345
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,542
he must have only specified

346
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,458
the fields he was
planning to initiate.

347
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,333
The quarantine field
was already operating.

348
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,500
LA FORGE:
Under normal circumstances

349
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:20,250
we could divert
that field energy

350
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,834
and use it to cancel the force
field protecting the Bridge.

351
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,250
But we have to retain
the medical quarantine.

352
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,792
Determine the absolute minimum
field energy Dr. Crusher needs

353
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,166
and use the rest
to get me onto my Bridge.

354
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,667
How are you
this morning?

355
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:46,959
Not so great.

356
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,041
I'm having trouble
standing up.

357
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,041
I get sort of dizzy.

358
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,083
You heard the old story
about the man

359
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,709
who goes to his doctor?

360
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,458
He says, "Doctor, it hurts
when I raise my arm like this."

361
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,667
The Doctor says, "Then don't
raise your arm like that."

362
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,875
So... if I get dizzy
standing up...

363
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,583
Then don't stand up.

364
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,542
(<i> door opens</i> )

365
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,417
Okay, Doc,
we're ready.

366
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,000
If all goes well, you
shouldn't notice a thing.

367
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,000
Make sure it goes well,
Commander.

368
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,291
Your brother tells me

369
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,500
that you still
won't speak to him.

370
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:29,959
So?

371
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,166
It's hard
on him, too.

372
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,834
He feels very guilty
about what happened.

373
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,250
He's your brother.

374
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,792
Why is everyone so worried
about him?

375
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,583
I'm the one who's sick.

376
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,625
I'm the one who's going to die.

377
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:47,000
Hey, nobody is going
to die, Willie.

378
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,542
Do you hear me?

379
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,375
Nobody.

380
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,583
Captain, we are in.

381
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,750
PICARD:
We're on our way, Lieutenant.

382
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:16,458
Computer,
restore Tactical Station.

383
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,709
Deactivation of command
function overrides

384
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,542
requires Alpha Two clearance.

385
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,875
Beverly thinks it's
going to be tight.

386
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,000
Let's hope he didn't take
us too far off course.

387
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,291
Let's hope.

388
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,000
It won't answer
to my clearance, sir.

389
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,625
Computer, this is
Captain Picard.

390
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,750
Return all command
functions to
their stations.

391
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,208
Alpha Two clearance recognized.

392
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,083
Please enter security code.

393
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,875
Security code?

394
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:47,083
Data.

395
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,542
I was afraid
of something like this.

396
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,250
Sensors are operative.

397
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,041
Well, at least
that's something.

398
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,542
What have you got?

399
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,166
No fix on Data.

400
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,000
But I am picking up
a single life-form

401
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,625
on the surface, sir.

402
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,333
It appears human.

403
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,750
That's a human that has the
answers to a lot of questions.

404
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,834
Something else.

405
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:08,917
What is it?

406
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,250
A small vessel.

407
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,750
Entering orbit.

408
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,667
I detect no life-forms
aboard, sir.

409
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,709
Mm-hmm. Good.

410
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,208
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Good, good, good.

411
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,417
Keep it up,
keep it up.

412
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:34,417
Old Tom Handy swore
you'd never master that.

413
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,583
Data, Data, whistle for me.

414
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:45,375
(<i> whistling</i>
<i>"Pop Goes the Weasel" off-key)</i>

415
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:46,583
Oh. Oh, well.

416
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,667
All right, that's enough.

417
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:50,458
Sit down, sit down.

418
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,458
Ah, beautiful, beautiful.

419
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,291
You know, I've been able
to keep track of you

420
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,500
from time to time.

421
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:01,750
You've become
something of a celebrity

422
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:04,667
in cybernetic circles.

423
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:09,625
Uh, Data, why Starfleet?

424
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:13,458
Sir?

425
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,625
I gave you the ability

426
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,875
to choose
whatever you wanted.

427
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:20,959
To do whatever you wanted.

428
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,917
Why Starfleet?

429
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:26,583
It was Starfleet officers
who rescued me.

430
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,709
Oh, so you decided

431
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,417
to emulate your
emancipators, huh?

432
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,917
How disappointing.

433
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,417
What choice of vocation

434
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,291
would have met
with your approval, sir?

435
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,250
Well, I often hoped

436
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:48,750
you might...
become a scientist.

437
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:52,542
Perhaps even
a cyberneticist.

438
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:56,166
To follow in your footsteps,
as it were.

439
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:58,542
I see nothing
wrong with that.

440
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,625
May I ask you a question, sir?

441
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,208
Certainly.

442
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,250
Anything
you like.

443
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,083
Why did you create me?

444
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:17,458
Why does a
painter paint?

445
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,417
Hmm?

446
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,333
Why does a boxer box?

447
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:27,625
You know what Michelangelo
used to say?

448
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:31,709
That the sculptures he made
were already there

449
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,834
before he started,
hidden in the marble.

450
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:39,625
All he needed to do
was... (<i> whistles</i> )

451
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,917
remove the unneeded bits.

452
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:44,208
Wasn't quite that easy
with you, Data.

453
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,667
But the need to do it,
<i>my</i> need to do it

454
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:51,166
was no different
than Michelangelo's need.

455
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:59,625
Now let me ask you a question.

456
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:05,625
Why are humans
so fascinated by old things?

457
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,125
Old things?

458
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:09,959
Old buildings,
churches, walls.

459
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,125
Ancient things.

460
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,041
Antique things.

461
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:15,291
Tables, clocks, knickknacks.

462
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:18,125
Why? Why? Why?

463
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,458
There are many
possible explanations.

464
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,667
If you brought a Noophian
to Earth

465
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:25,667
he'd probably look around
and say

466
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:27,166
"Tear that old village down.

467
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:29,250
"It's hanging in rags.

468
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:32,417
Build me something... something
new, something efficient."

469
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:33,875
But to a human

470
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:39,417
that... that old house,
that ancient wall...

471
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,709
that's a shrine.

472
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,792
Something to be cherished.

473
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,792
Again, I ask you, why?

474
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,500
Perhaps, for humans

475
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:57,333
old things represent
a tie to the past.

476
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:00,458
Well, what's so important
about the past?

477
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,458
People got sick,
they needed money.

478
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,834
Why tie yourself to that?

479
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,875
Humans are mortal.

480
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:09,333
They seem to need a sense
of continuity.

481
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,000
Aha. Hmm...

482
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:13,875
Why?

483
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:17,041
To give their lives meaning,
a sense of purpose.

484
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,333
Oh. Well.

485
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:25,959
And, uh, this continuity--
does it only run one way?

486
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,375
Backwards... to the past?

487
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:31,583
I suppose it is a factor

488
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,792
in the human desire
to procreate.

489
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:39,208
Oh, so you believe
that having children

490
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:44,458
gives humans a sense
of immortality,

491
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,959
do you?

492
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:49,041
It is a reasonable explanation
to your query, sir.

493
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:56,959
And to yours,
as well, Data.

494
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,250
(<i> door opens</i> )

495
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:12,959
Lore!

496
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:21,250
Looks like we have ourselves
a... family reunion.

497
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:29,291
Open.

498
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,375
DATA:
I implore you

499
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:31,959
do not reactivate him.

500
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,917
Don't be
ridiculous, Data.

501
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:36,625
Lore is far from
the maniacal android

502
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:39,125
you have made him out to be.

503
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:42,667
In any case, he'll obey me.

504
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,583
He always did.

505
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:45,750
But he admitted
to an alliance

506
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,000
with the Crystal Entity.

507
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,208
To gain its favor,
he betrayed the colonists

508
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,417
and would have betrayed

509
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:53,542
the<i> Enterprise</i> as well,
had I not...

510
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:56,417
Shh.

511
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:59,500
One more.

512
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:02,667
That should do it.

513
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:08,291
Shh, shh-shh-shh.

514
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,583
So... you're still alive.

515
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,750
I'm surprised
you woke me.

516
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:20,583
Why didn't you just
take me apart again

517
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:23,166
and be done with it?

518
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,166
That is why the two of you

519
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,542
captured me, isn't it?

520
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:29,250
SOONG:
Data had nothing
to do with this, Lore.

521
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,417
And nobody captured you.

522
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:35,041
Not exactly, that is.

523
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:40,542
You see, both of your brains
contain a simple homing device.

524
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,917
Data's was activated
purposefully.

525
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:46,458
Yours... Well, until you
walked through that door

526
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,834
I had no idea you'd
ever been reassembled.

527
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,917
No thanks to you.

528
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:55,208
But thanks to you
dear Brother,

529
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,333
I spent nearly
two years drifting in space.

530
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,000
If it hadn't been
for a fortunate encounter

531
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:03,291
with a Pakled trade ship,
I'd still be out there.

532
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,166
I had no alternative.

533
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,166
You would have destroyed
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

534
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,458
Well, since I seem to be

535
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,667
an uninvited guest
at your little party

536
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:17,500
I'll leave you
with your beloved son

537
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:19,291
and be on my way.

538
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,625
SOONG:
Lore, wait.

539
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,917
There are questions
I can answer.

540
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:29,125
You'll have no chance
to ask them later.

541
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,041
You see, I'm dying.

542
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,500
Yeah, I'm dying.

543
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,959
Dying from what, sir?

544
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,291
Wait a minute.

545
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,625
Wait a minute.

546
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:47,166
What... what do you mean,
you're dying?

547
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,917
You look fine.

548
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,083
You're not that old.

549
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:57,041
You... you look fine.

550
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:58,792
What is this?
Some kind of a trick?

551
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:03,291
I wish it were.

552
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:10,959
We have control
of sensors

553
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,333
life-support and
auxiliary power, Captain.

554
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,458
Nothing more.

555
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,834
The code, Mr. La Forge?

556
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,750
We can't even locate
the file address.

557
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:18,959
At least, that would tell us

558
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,250
how many digits
we're talking about.

559
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,875
Not that it would
really help much.

560
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:23,750
I want something
that will really help.

561
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:25,250
CRUSHER:
And quickly, too.

562
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:28,291
Willie Potts has
24 hours, 36 tops.

563
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,542
If it goes much
longer than that

564
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,583
the only thing left
for Starbase 416

565
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:34,041
will be to do a postmortem.

566
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,583
Geordi, if the
computer's programmed

567
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,834
to allow Data
to transport down

568
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,083
it would figure
that it would allow him

569
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,125
to beam back up, right?

570
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:41,458
It would figure.

571
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,709
And Data would have
left a trace imprint

572
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,709
when he beamed down?

573
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,125
Sure, everybody does.

574
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:47,959
So, what would be involved
in pulling that trace

575
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,500
and finding a way to
make the computer think

576
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:50,750
someone else is Data?

577
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:51,959
Maybe a few
someone elses?

578
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

579
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,250
We'd have to access
the transport controller

580
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,917
and reset it to a testing mode.

581
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,625
Convince it that it's
still back in school

582
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:00,250
accepting simulated inputs.

583
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,625
That's not going to be easy
without the main computer

584
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:05,959
but I suppose we could network
a few tricorders together.

585
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,375
Try, Mr. La Forge.

586
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:08,750
Yes, sir.

587
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,834
You did what you had to do?

588
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,291
What kind of an answer
is that?

589
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,333
The only one I can give you.

590
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:24,375
You were not
functioning properly.

591
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:25,542
Lore told me

592
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,208
the colonists envied him

593
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,583
because you made him
so completely human.

594
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:34,917
I wouldn't exactly have used
the word "envious," Data.

595
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,041
You disassembled me.

596
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,333
You took me apart.

597
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,083
Lore also told me
that the colonists

598
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:43,417
petitioned you to replace him
with a less perfect android.

599
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh...

600
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:47,875
The last thing you should
think of yourself as, Data

601
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:49,583
is less perfect.

602
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:52,959
The two of you are virtually
identical, except for a bit

603
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,333
of programming.

604
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,291
It was a lie.

605
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,834
Another lie.

606
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,125
I would have proven myself
worthy to you

607
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:05,166
if you'd just given me a chance.

608
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:09,458
But it was easier
just to turn your back

609
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,667
and build your precious Data.

610
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:13,333
You were the first.

611
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:16,417
You meant as much
to me as Data ever did

612
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,041
but you were unstable.

613
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,750
The colonists were not
envious of you.

614
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:21,500
They were<i> afraid</i> of you.

615
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:22,792
You were unstable.

616
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:23,875
I am not

617
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:27,125
less perfect than Lore.

618
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:30,583
Why didn't you just fix me?

619
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,917
It was within your power
to fix me.

620
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:35,417
It wasn't as easy as that.

621
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:40,417
The next... the next logical
step was to construct Data.

622
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:45,041
Afterward, I planned to get
back to you, to-to fix you.

623
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:50,417
"Next logical step."

624
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:53,917
I am not less perfect than Lore.

625
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:56,208
(<i> mocking Data</i> ):
"I am not less perfect
than Lore."

626
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,417
Enough!

627
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,125
Both of you, sit down.

628
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,458
Sit down.

629
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:15,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

630
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:20,041
For all these years, I've been
plagued by what went wrong.

631
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,625
With all of your
complexities, Lore

632
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,250
your nuances...

633
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:30,166
basic emotion seemed
almost simple by comparison.

634
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:35,250
But the emotion
turned and twisted

635
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:38,875
became entangled
with ambition.

636
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:41,000
Lore...

637
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:44,291
if I had known you were
no longer sitting in pieces

638
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:47,667
on some distant shelf,
if I had known

639
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:52,166
tha-that I could simply press
a button and bring you here

640
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:55,041
I would have spent those years
trying to make things right

641
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,375
for you as well.

642
00:33:57,417 --> 00:34:00,750
But all I knew of was Data.

643
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,583
So I worked long

644
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:05,125
and hard.
Yes.

645
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:08,083
And now I believe
I've succeeded.

646
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:15,250
This... this...

647
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,709
this... is why I've brought
you here, Data.

648
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:25,250
Basic emotions.

649
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:28,959
Simple feelings, Data.

650
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,250
Your feelings.

651
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:35,917
I've imagined
how hard it's been for you

652
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:39,166
living amongst beings
so moved by emotion.

653
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,625
I don't have to imagine.

654
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:48,625
I know how hard it's been.

655
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:51,000
You'll be surprised, Data.

656
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:53,542
Feelings do
funny things.

657
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:59,750
You may even learn to...
understand your evil brother.

658
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:01,625
To forgive him.

659
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,291
We will be more alike, Data,
you and I.

660
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,625
You'll see.

661
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:11,875
I'm... I'm happy for you.

662
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:14,000
I question your sincerity, Lore.

663
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:16,959
Well, perhaps with this

664
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
you'll learn
to be more trusting, Data.

665
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:23,250
Your brother has had good reason
to be bitter.

666
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:25,875
But, sir, Lore was
responsible for...

667
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:29,458
He wasn't given the chance
that you and I were given--

668
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,375
to live.

669
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:33,625
But now, I'm sure he understands

670
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:37,041
why I did
what I had to do.

671
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,500
If there were only time, Lore.

672
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:42,709
What a shame.

673
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:48,083
The procedure is quite simple,
hmm, but I'm tired.

674
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,458
I need to rest first.

675
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm tired.

676
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,417
They're sure this
is going to work?

677
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:24,625
Nobody knows
the transporters

678
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:26,125
better than O'Brien
and La Forge.

679
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,542
They tell me they've managed
more than a little

680
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,542
sleight of hand with our
authorization codes.

681
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:31,208
They can insert them
into the recall loop?

682
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,417
The computer should think
all three of us are Data.

683
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,583
I just hope we don't
all beam back

684
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:37,291
looking like Data.

685
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,083
Whenever
you say, sir.

686
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,333
Bring him home,
Number One.

687
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,709
Energize.

688
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:06,375

I've always loved that ditty

696
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,333
but I could never quite get
the cadence right.

697
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,000
Thank you, Father.

698
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,834
You called me Father.

699
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:39,041
Well, what would you prefer
I called you?

700
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,125

701
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,625
What did Lore tell you
about that?

702
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:46,000
That is what the colonists
called you, isn't it?

Often-Wrong Soong.

704
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,208
It is a very sloppy rhyme.

705
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,458
Wrong Soong? Wrong Soong?

706
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,750
I-I-It just doesn't work.

Data, how are
you feeling?

709
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:01,417
Often-Wrong's
got a broken heart.

710
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:05,250
Can't even tell his boys apart.

711
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:06,375
Lore.

(<i> laughing</i> )

713
