1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,542
You don't believe in me.

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,000
I don't.

3
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,917
What evidence
would you have

4
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:18,083
of my reality
beyond that of your senses?

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,917
I don't know.

6
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:23,959
Why do you doubt
your senses?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,250
Because...

8
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,125
a little thing
affects them.

9
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,917
A slight disorder
of the stomach

10
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,333
makes them cheats.

11
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:34,625
You may be a bit
of undigested beef

12
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,709
a blot of mustard,
a crumb of cheese

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,917
a fragment
of an underdone potato.

14
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:44,792
Why, there's more of gravy
than of grave about you

15
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,667
whatever you are.

16
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:48,500
Humbug, I tell you.

17
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:49,542
Humbug.

18
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,583
(<i> screaming</i> )

19
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,875
(<i> fearful cry</i> )

20
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:55,166
Freeze program.

21
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:59,333
Very well done, Data.

22
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,375
Your performance skills
really are improving.

23
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:04,458
Your courtesy
is appreciated, sir

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,625
but I am aware that I do not
effectively convey the fear

25
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,875
called for in the story.

26
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:12,458
Well, you've never
known fear, Data

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,834
but as an acute
observer of behavior

28
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,792
you should be able
to approximate it.

29
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:19,375
Sir, that is not
an appropriate basis

30
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:21,208
for an effective performance.

31
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,333
Not by the standards
set by my mentors.

32
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,417
Your mentors?

33
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,542
Yes, sir.

34
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,750
I have studied
the philosophies

35
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:30,542
of virtually
every known acting master.

36
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:36,250
I find myself attracted
to Stanislavsky, Adler, Garnav--

37
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,208
proponents of
an acting technique

38
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,834
known as "The Method."

39
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,834
Method acting, huh?

40
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,417
I'm vaguely familiar with it

41
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:49,041
but why would you choose
such an old-fashioned approach?

42
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,750
Perhaps because
the technique

43
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:53,458
requires an actor to seek
his own emotional awareness

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,667
to understand the
character he plays.

45
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,041
But, surely, that's
an impossible task
for you, Data.

46
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:03,000
Sir, I have modified the method
for my own uses.

47
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,625
Since I have
no emotional awareness

48
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,542
to create a performance

49
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,125
I am attempting
to use performance

50
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,375
to create emotional awareness.

51
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:11,667
I believe if I can learn

52
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:14,583
to duplicate the fear
of Ebenezer Scrooge

53
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:18,041
I will be one step closer
to truly understanding humanity.

54
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:22,208
RIKER:
Captain Picard,
please report to the Bridge.

55
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,500
On my way, Number One.

56
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:27,417
Data, the moment
that you decided

57
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,208
to stop imitating
other actors

58
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,625
and create your
own interpretation

59
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,458
you were already
one step closer

60
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,875
to understanding
humanity.

61
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,959
We've received
an emergency transmission

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,041
from the science station
on Ventax II, sir.

63
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,375
What's the nature
of the emergency?

64
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,041
Uncertain.
The signal was interrupted...

65
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,417
Contact reestablished
with Ventax II, sir.

66
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,375
On screen.

67
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:57,917
I am Dr. Howard Clark,
director of the science station

68
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,083
here on Ventax II.

69
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,041
Thank you for responding.

70
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,208
Mr. Worf,
can you improve our reception?

71
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,583
The trouble is
at the transmission source, sir.

72
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:10,291
Dr. Clark, we're barely able to
maintain communication with you.

73
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,792
Can you boost the level
of your power source?

74
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm afraid not, Captain.
It's under attack.

75
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,250
Under attack?

76
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,542
There's a mob outside the door

77
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,208
trying to break
into the station.

78
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,375
The planet is in chaos--
lootings, fires

79
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:25,166
mass hysteria.

80
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,750
These people
are all convinced

81
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:30,208
that their world is coming
to an end<i> tomorrow.</i>

82
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,709
Please, we must have
your immediate...

83
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:11,417
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

84
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,417
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

85
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

86
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,041
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

87
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:25,458
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

88
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,458
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

89
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,583
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44474.5.</i>

90
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,417
<i>We have reached Ventax II</i>

91
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,375
<i>and are attempting to contact</i>
<i>the Federation science station</i>

92
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:40,750
<i>which at last report was</i>
<i>under siege by an angry mob.</i>

93
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,542
They are
transmitting again.

94
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,083
On screen,
before we lose contact.

95
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,208
<i>Enterprise.</i>

96
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,625
<i>Enterprise,</i> do you read me?!

97
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,166
Emergency! We need help.

98
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,041
Dr. Clark,
this is Captain Picard.

99
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,458
We are ready to beam you
and your team

100
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,417
on board...

101
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,792
(<i> explosion</i> )

102
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,208
They're in! They're in!

103
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,667
Transporter Room Three

104
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:59,500
lock onto the science team,
beam them aboard.

105
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:00,917
I've locked onto Dr. Clark.

106
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,458
I can't pick out the others.

107
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,417
It's a mess down there.

108
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,250
Then beam Dr. Clark aboard
by himself.

109
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,458
Yes, Captain.

110
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,458
Mr. Worf, will you escort him

111
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,458
to my ready room.

112
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,875
Aye, sir.

113
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,625
Number One, try
and make some sense

114
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,417
out of this mess.

115
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:27,458
The people in Ventax II
live in an agrarian society.

116
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,542
At least, they do now.

117
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,333
What do you mean "now"?

118
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,291
It's an interesting
anthropological question

119
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:38,875
one we were studying
before the... trouble began.

120
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,542
In the distant past

121
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,959
the Ventaxian culture
had achieved

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,417
an extremely, um,
advanced scientific level

123
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,750
but a millennium ago

124
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:53,458
they turned their backs
on technology.

125
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,750
They reverted
to a simpler existence.

126
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,875
And remained that way
for centuries.

127
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01,917
First contact was made
by a Klingon expedition

128
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,625
70 years ago.

129
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,166
Since then,
the new technology's

130
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,875
been available
to the Ventaxians.

131
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:09,041
They simply are not
interested in it.

132
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:13,458
Virtually no social problems
can be found on this planet.

133
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,083
In fact, I would have
described their society

134
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,792
as idyllic, until...

135
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,542
Until what, Doctor?

136
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,333
It's hard to believe.

137
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:28,500
Several years ago, Acost Jared,
the Ventaxian head of state

138
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:31,000
began to grow
increasingly obsessed

139
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,041
with the legend of Ardra.

140
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,959
With each passing day,
he grew more anxious

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,125
and he'd talk
about little else.

142
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,500
"Ardra is coming back.

143
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,041
"Ardra will be here soon.

144
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,250
"We must all leave

145
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,208
before Ardra returns."

146
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,625
And who is this Ardra?

147
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:54,458
For all intents and purposes...

148
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,709
the devil.

149
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,834
Captain, these people
actually believe

150
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,166
they've sold their souls
to the devil.

151
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,125
Riker to Captain Picard.

152
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,417
Have you located the
science team, Number One?

153
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,583
Evidently, they're
being held hostage.

154
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,917
Hostage?

155
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,208
There's a Ventaxian leader

156
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,750
on the viewscreen,
name of Acost Jared.

157
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,250
Doctor.

158
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,291
Jared, you must secure
the release of my people.

159
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,125
I can't believe
you would allow this.

160
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:33,083
Howard, my friend, you know
how I abhor all acts of violence

161
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,166
but events
are out of my control.

162
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,792
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

163
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:38,583
Is there nothing you can do?

164
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,709
As the hour of Ardra's return
approaches, fear has overwhelmed

165
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,375
my people.

166
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:45,166
It has been a thousand years!

167
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,125
The prophecies have come true.

168
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,709
Prophecies?

169
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,959
Ardra's arrival was
supposed to be heralded

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,417
with the shaking
of the cities.

171
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,458
Now, there has been a series
of geological tremors

172
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,458
on the planet--
minor quakes.

173
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,375
Nothing extraordinary.

174
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,333
But poorly timed.

175
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,917
There is more.

176
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,959
For several nights, there have
been visions of Ardra.

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,125
Again, just as the contract said
would occur before her return.

178
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,959
Visions? You mean dreams.

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,792
No. She has appeared.

180
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:13,875
I, myself, have seen her.

181
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:17,000
Jared, tell your people,
if the hostages are released

182
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,458
I am prepared
to offer Federation assistance

183
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,875
should this...
this Ardra return.

184
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,542
I'm afraid it will not matter.

185
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:29,375
They know your weapons are
useless against her, Captain.

186
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:32,583
I will make inquiries
concerning the hostages.

187
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,375
The innocent should not suffer
for our sins

188
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,500
but I can make no promises.

189
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,125
This situation is
deteriorating, Captain.

190
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,041
The people are reaching
levels of anxiety

191
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,083
that could lead to suicide.

192
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,750
Mr. Data, what do we
know about this Ardra?

193
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:53,208
She is a cornerstone
of Ventaxian theology.

194
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,500
It seems Ardra came to Ventax II

195
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,709
and promised 1,000 years
of peace and prosperity

196
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,166
for a price--
upon her return

197
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,041
she would enslave
the entire population.

198
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,458
In Ventaxian culture,
it is considered bad luck

199
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,417
to speak her
name out loud.

200
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,542
CLARK:
There are ancient scrolls
concerning Ardra

201
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,959
that are stored
in the Atheneum Vaults.

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,667
Scholars study them.

203
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:18,083
They've been of little
public interest
until recently.

204
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,583
I think I should meet
with this Acost Jared.

205
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,208
He's still our best hope
for a release of the hostages.

206
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,041
I'll arrange to have him
transported on board.

207
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,417
No, I'm going
down to the planet myself.

208
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,875
Sir, you'd run the risk

209
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:31,709
of being taken
as an additional hostage.

210
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,959
Mr. Worf, you and Mr. Data
will accompany me.

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,291
Mr. O'Brien can keep a lock
on our communicators.

212
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,250
He can pull us
out if necessary.

213
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,709
Yes, sir.

214
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,375
PICARD:
Counselor, I want
you to come, too.

215
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,250
(<i> screams</i>
<i>and distant explosions</i> )

216
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,542
Captain Picard, you
shouldn't have come.

217
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,250
Your life is
in danger here.

218
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,917
You must calm your people.

219
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,208
There is no reason
for panic.

220
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,417
No reason?

221
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,625
If these tremors
have frightened them

222
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,417
leading to this hysteria
over Ardra

223
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,834
let us reassure them.

224
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,500
We have scanned the
tectonic stress patterns

225
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,291
of your planet's crust.

226
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,709
There is no evidence
that the quakes

227
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,041
pose any kind of threat.

228
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:22,750
No, no, no.
The threat is from Ardra.

229
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,792
You cannot understand.

230
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,667
If you can at least help us
to locate our people.

231
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,333
(<i> rumbling</i> )

232
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,333
She is here.

233
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,208
Nonsense. It is only...

234
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,417
Time's up.

235
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,834
(<i> people screaming</i> )

236
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,250
I'm disappointed.

237
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,458
I expected my tenants

238
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,542
to take better care
of my property.

239
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,959
Ardra, most powerful one

240
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,375
I am Jared,
leader of Ventax II.

241
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:10,291
I take responsibility
for all that displeases you.

242
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,625
Please, do not
punish my people.

243
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,917
Punish? Who said anything
about punishing?

244
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,375
I merely expect your end
of our contract to be upheld.

245
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:20,834
Thank you, Ardra.

246
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,875
And don't talk like some
ancient prophet around me

247
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:26,208
with "thees" and "thous"
and "most powerful ones."

248
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,625
It was appealing
for a few centuries

249
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:30,166
but I bore easily.

250
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,709
And stop cowering.

251
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,417
When I want you on your knees,
I'll let you know.

252
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,875
Much better.

253
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:40,291
A fine example
for the others.

254
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,583
Who would you be?

255
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,917
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard

256
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,667
of the Federation Starship
<i>Enterprise.</i>

257
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,500
Keep up
the good work.

258
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,333
Now, the first thing we'll need
is an accounting

259
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,083
of all you've been
accumulating for me.

260
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,834
This form will provide
guidelines

261
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,875
for a full census
of the population

262
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:03,417
with emphasis on productivity
and economic forecasts.

263
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,000
Who are you?

264
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,041
My, you are forceful,
aren't you?

265
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,667
Good. I like my men
to be forceful

266
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,458
at least, at the start.

267
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,917
If your intention
is to intimidate

268
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,000
you're not succeeding.

269
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,041
That's all right.

270
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,792
I like a challenge.

271
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,250
TROI:
An entire planet

272
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,000
has been terrorized
because of the suggestion

273
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,834
that you're going
to enslave the population.

274
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,458
Well, it's true.

275
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,625
Of course, I wouldn't put
it so melodramatically.

276
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,417
It's just a
standard contract

277
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,834
with an unusually
long term.

278
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,709
So you do purport to be
the mythic figure Ardra?

279
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,834
I have many names,
my pale friend.

280
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:41,000
I am Mendora
in the Berussian Cluster.

281
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,709
Torak to the Drellians.

282
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,959
The Klingons call me<i> Fek'lhr.</i>

283
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,875
You are not<i> Fek'lhr.</i>

284
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,250
Ah, but I am.

285
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,667
I am the Guardian

286
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,041
of<i> Gre'thor</i>
where the dishonored go

287
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:02,125
when they die.

288
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:06,625
But here on Ventax II,
I am called Ardra.

289
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,750
The same Ardra
who negotiated a contract

290
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:12,000
with these people ten
centuries ago today.

291
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,250
Oh, you doubt me.

292
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,417
A non-believer.

293
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,625
Really, Jean-Luc Picard

294
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,291
of the Federation Starship
<i>Enterprise</i>

295
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,792
no doubt you have
traveled the galaxy

296
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,375
encountered a diverse
universe of creatures.

297
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:28,083
Is there no room
for the likes of me?

298
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,625
I've encountered many

299
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:32,208
who are more credibly to be
called the devil than you.

300
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,458
The devil.

301
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,250
Now there's one I haven't
heard in a long time.

302
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,041
You claim you visited
this planet 1,000 years ago

303
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,458
and negotiated a contract?

304
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,959
That's correct.

305
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,709
I would like to see
that contract.

306
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,834
The scrolls of Ardra, Captain.

307
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,291
A long-winded
description

308
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,792
of a very simple
business arrangement.

309
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,875
I did away with their wars,
famine and economic ruin

310
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:09,208
and provided them
1,000 years of paradise.

311
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,834
My terms were clearly stated.

312
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,125
They went into this
with their eyes open.

313
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,041
I'm sure you'll find
everything is in order.

314
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,166
You won't mind if I don't
take your word for it.

315
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,792
Jared, with your permission

316
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:26,250
I'd like Mr. Data to review
these scrolls thoroughly.

317
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,500
It is no longer
my decision, Captain.

318
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:36,500
I<i> have</i> intrigued you,
haven't I, Picard?

319
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,583
I am only here
to secure the release

320
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,542
of the Federation hostages.

321
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,208
Hostages?

322
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,583
Is this true?

323
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,917
Uh... yes, Ardra.

324
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,959
Panic gripped the people
as the time of your return

325
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,166
grew closer.

326
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,125
Yes, I do have
that effect on people.

327
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,333
See that the hostages
are released-- now!

328
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,709
Immediately.

329
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,792
Let us not cloud this
with bit players, Picard.

330
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:05,250
You will not leave because
you find<i> me</i> irresistible.

331
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,583
<i>Enterprise,</i> advise Dr. Clark

332
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,417
that the hostages
are being released.

333
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,500
This is Clark.

334
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:15,834
You did it, Captain.

335
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,041
Thank goodness.

336
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,166
Goodness had nothing
to do with it.

337
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,500
Three to beam up.

338
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,542
Mr. Data will remain
on the planet's surface.

339
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,333
Data, I want
a complete report

340
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,834
on the contents
of these documents.

341
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:32,709
I refuse to abandon
this planet to that woman.

342
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,875
Energize.

343
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,333
Could she be another refugee
from the Q Continuum?

344
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,625
For that matter,
could she<i> be</i> Q?

345
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,417
Q would never bother
with contracts.

346
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,458
Or economic
forecasts.

347
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,291
I noticed that, too, Counselor.

348
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,583
I had the distinct
impression

349
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,166
of being in the presence of a...

350
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,291
a flimflam artist.

351
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,458
WORF:
But her powers?

352
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,667
Her powers are,
at the best, unclear.

353
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,417
Think about it, Mr. Worf.

354
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,667
Transporter
technology

355
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,083
can make things
appear and disappear.

356
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,375
The illusion that she
can transform herself

357
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,041
into a Klingon creature

358
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,542
could be created
by holographic projection.

359
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,250
CLARK:
And creating
a minor tremor

360
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,500
could be the result
of a low-frequency tractor beam

361
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,250
projected against
the tectonic plates.

362
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,125
We are capable of recreating
all of these events.

363
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,709
It's just that she
dresses them up

364
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,583
and she delivers them
with more dramatic flair.

365
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,041
Like a magician.

366
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,333
Exactly.

367
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,709
TROI:
She has an incredibly
focused mind.

368
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,125
It was virtually impossible
to sense any deception.

369
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,750
Or anything else,
for that matter.

370
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:45,125
The best magicians
will never let you see

371
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,041
what's up their sleeve,
Counselor.

372
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,000
She must be tapping into
some sort of power source

373
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,250
to produce those effects.

374
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,750
She's not hiding
that up her sleeve.

375
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,291
Number One, I want
you and Mr. Worf

376
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,583
to run high-resolution scans
of this star system.

377
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,542
Look for a ship,
a base of operations

378
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,667
anything large enough

379
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,000
to generate
that power.

380
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,542
Mr. La Forge,
accompany Dr. Clark

381
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,083
back to the science station.

382
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,166
See if you can trace

383
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,166
the origin
of these tremors.

384
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:19,959
Your chair offers a lovely view
of my planet, Picard.

385
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,750
Come, sit with me.

386
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:24,500
Either leave my Bridge

387
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,959
or I will remove you
by force.

388
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,500
By force?

389
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,667
(<i> laughing</i> )

390
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,625
You disappoint me.

391
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,041
You didn't strike me
as that sort, Picard.

392
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:39,166
But, by all means, try.

393
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,500
Mr. Worf?

394
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,583
I was really hoping
you'd try it yourself.

395
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:06,542
Transporter Room Three,
lock onto the intruder

396
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,834
and transport her
to the planet's surface.

397
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,250
Aye, sir.

398
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,166
Ensign, put up the shields
until further notice.

399
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,709
Yes, sir, Captain,
whatever you say.

400
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,041
We are not impressed
with your magic tricks.

401
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,083
I pity you.

402
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,500
We live in a universe of magic

403
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,417
which, evidently,
you cannot see.

404
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,083
(<i> door opening</i> )

405
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,041
Ah, my pale friend
has returned.

406
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,125
Have you finished

407
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,709
examining
the contract?

408
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,667
I have, sir.

409
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,333
Report, Mr. Data.

410
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,917
The contract agrees to deliver
the people of Ventax II

411
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,875
into the personal
servitude of Ardra

412
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,917
after 1,000
years of peace.

413
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,333
I have compared
the terms

414
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,291
to the body of laws
which govern the planet.

415
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,041
The language of the agreement
is correct in every detail, sir.

416
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,875
Such speed and accuracy.

417
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,458
You're much too talented
to be human.

418
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,834
I am an android.

419
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,417
Android? Of course.

420
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:06,083
How wonderful--
an unexpected bonus.

421
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,333
Bonus?

422
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,458
Yes.

423
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,375
When the contract came to term

424
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,792
I gained clear title
to the planet--

425
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:16,000
anything on the surface,
in the air, or...

426
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,000
in orbit.

427
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,750
So, you see,
the<i> Enterprise</i> belongs

428
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,250
to me now as well.

429
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,583
(<i> chuckles</i> )

430
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:28,041
I am afraid the contract could
be interpreted

431
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,750
in that way, sir.

432
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,792
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

433
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:46,333
<i>Although I consider this</i>
<i>woman's claim upon my ship</i>

434
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,250
<i>to be an empty threat,</i>
<i>it has further inspired</i>

435
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,583
<i>my determination to expose her</i>
<i>for the fraud she is.</i>

436
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:55,959
(<i> door chimes</i> )

437
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,291
Come.

438
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,417
You wish to see me, sir?

439
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,917
Yes, Mr. Data.

440
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,875
A wise man once said

441
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:13,333
"There is a sucker
born every minute."

442
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,000
Barnum, sir. P.T.

443
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,709
I've been examining
the dynamics

444
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,500
of what used to be called

445
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,750
"the con game."

446
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:24,792
Quite fascinating--

447
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,625
worthy of your
study, Data.

448
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,333
Sir, do you
believe Ardra is--

449
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:33,000
to use the vernacular--
a con artist?

450
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,500
Yes, I do, Data.

451
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:42,208
And I believe it is our job
to out-con the con artist.

452
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,500
Sir, I must point out
that the Ventaxians

453
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:49,333
did have 1,000 years
of peace and tranquility

454
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,500
as promised by Ardra.

455
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,875
We can only speculate

456
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:54,083
what happened on that planet
1,000 years ago.

457
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,542
Maybe a Ventaxian leader

458
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,709
saw the destruction
of his society at hand

459
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,709
and he conceived
this "contract of Ardra"

460
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,125
to motivate change.

461
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,709
Or maybe there<i> was</i>
an Ardra of some sort

462
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,458
who was the basis
for this mythology.

463
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,542
Who knows?

464
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,000
The point is...

465
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:13,333
that somehow a fundamental
theology was created

466
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,250
which transformed
this society

467
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,917
but in the process
of change

468
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:21,125
created this latent fear

469
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,959
which has been passed down
through generations.

470
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,417
Data, from your
own experience

471
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,500
of performing
Ebenezer Scrooge

472
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:32,750
you're aware how fear can be
a very powerful motivator.

473
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:34,125
Indeed, sir.

474
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,583
In the story,
the spirits used fear

475
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,458
to motivate Scrooge
to reform his character.

476
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,834
And in the hands of a con artist

477
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:46,417
fear can be used to motivate
obedience, capitulation

478
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:50,000
the exploitation
of innocent people

479
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,417
and that is what I believe
has happened here

480
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,250
and I intend
to prove that.

481
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:58,041
I need to find a loophole--
some way of challenging

482
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,375
the validity
of this contract.

483
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:01,792
Sir, the language
of the contract

484
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:05,250
seems carefully chosen
to avoid any loopholes.

485
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,583
Check it again, Mr. Data

486
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,834
and check every Ventaxian
legal precedent

487
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,667
for the last 1,000 years.

488
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:11,834
We'll talk again
in the morning.

489
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,166
Aye, sir.

490
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:36,208
(<i> wind whistling</i> )

491
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:45,583
Picard to Bridge.

492
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,125
Intruder alert.

493
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,542
Picard to Bridge.

494
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,583
Oh, I've arranged
for a bit of privacy.

495
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:02,166
(<i> buzzing</i> )

496
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:10,208
Just the two of us.

497
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,417
(<i> seductive laughter</i> )

498
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,583
This is becoming very tiresome.

499
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,834
Oh, come now, Picard.

500
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:21,083
You know
you find me tantalizing.

501
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,166
Give in to your desires.

502
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,500
You know, there's nothing

503
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,875
about you I find
tantalizing.

504
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:34,625
On the contrary I find
you obvious and vulgar.

505
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:37,000
Easily fixed.

506
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,583
I can be
your ideal woman, Picard--

507
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:42,458
prim and proper

508
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,333
and chaste

509
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:47,333
until I succumb
to your charms.

510
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,583
Or would your fantasies

511
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,458
turn more toward
a professional woman?

512
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,417
One, perhaps, who wears
a Starfleet uniform?

513
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,583
Perhaps I could even be...

514
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:59,291
...someone close at hand,
yet unattainable.

515
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:05,208
I can do anything
for you, Captain...

516
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,875
Anything you could
ever imagine.

517
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:13,417
I could give you a night that
would light fire

518
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,208
in your dreams until you die

519
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,667
and you would reject me?

520
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:20,792
Oh, yes.

521
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:22,291
You shall regret that.

522
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,625
I think not.

523
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:24,959
Oh, but you will.

524
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:30,667
Captain Picard.

525
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:33,375
Captain, I-I wasn't
expecting you here.

526
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:35,500
Neither was I.

527
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:37,125
La Forge to<i> Enterprise.</i>

528
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,250
Go ahead.

529
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:40,041
Worf, Captain
Picard is here.

530
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,750
You'd better transport him
back on board.

531
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,625
The Captain? But I have no...

532
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,250
PICARD:
It's all right, Mr. Worf.

533
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:48,041
Ardra somehow
transported me here.

534
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,375
Will you beam me
directly to my quarters?

535
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:52,000
Aye, sir.

536
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:55,291
We're locked onto you.

537
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,667
Transporter is malfunctioning,
Captain.

538
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,542
Some sort of interference.

539
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:00,875
Checking.

540
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:03,375
Just have Mr. Data
fetch me in a shuttle

541
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:05,417
and have him bring along
a uniform.

542
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,375
Did you say "uniform"?

543
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,959
Yes, I did.

544
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,375
Aye, sir.

545
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,792
Mr. La Forge and Dr. Clark
have made no headway.

546
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:22,375
Commander Riker
and Lieutenant Worf

547
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:24,583
have picked nothing up
on their scans.

548
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,875
Sir, I believe
I have found

549
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,125
an obscure precedent
in Ventaxian law

550
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,500
which may be of interest.

551
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:30,834
Yes?

552
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:33,250
The case involves
a contract dispute

553
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,667
over services rendered
by a Klingon craftsman

554
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:38,250
on the construction
of a Ventaxian home.

555
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:41,583
Because the dispute
involved an alien culture

556
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,667
the parties decided
that arbitration

557
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:46,458
rather than the courts,
should resolve the issue.

558
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,083
Both parties agreed
to chose an arbitrator.

559
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:54,000
It is the only known case
involving an alien claimant.

560
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,417
That's exactly what I needed.

561
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,750
Well done, Data.

562
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,500
Shuttlecraft One to<i> Enterprise.</i>

563
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:04,583
Prepare for docking sequence.

564
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,458
RIKER:
Proceed, Shuttle One.

565
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:10,667
(<i> consoles beeping</i> )

566
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:13,041
<i>Enterprise?</i>

567
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,709
<i>Enterprise,</i>
do you read me?

568
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,500
<i>Enterprise,</i> come in.

569
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:32,375
I cannot locate the<i> Enterprise</i>
anywhere within one light-year

570
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,875
of the planet, sir.

571
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,667
I don't believe Ardra
is capable of transporting

572
00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:37,500
the<i> Enterprise</i>
a light-year away.

573
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,000
Keep hailing
them, Mr. Data.

574
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,542
Repeat on all
frequencies.

575
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,041
Hey, I think
we found something here.

576
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,125
There's a sudden jump
in Z-particle readings

577
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,542
just about the time
the<i> Enterprise</i> disappeared.

578
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:51,750
Where did it
originate?

579
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,333
It was too brief
to pinpoint.

580
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,625
But it could suggest
a hidden power source.

581
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,542
Gentlemen, we need
to find that source

582
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,000
if we are to defeat this woman.

583
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,333
Well, if you can get
her to perform

584
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:02,333
a few more
magic tricks like that one

585
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,250
we just might be able
to track it down.

586
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:09,208
So, I trust you have
a bit more respect for me now.

587
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,875
What have you done
with my ship?

588
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:13,166
I've done nothing
with your ship.

589
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,875
<i>My</i> ship is safely
in my possession.

590
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:19,250
I do not recognize your
claim on the<i> Enterprise</i>

591
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,458
nor on this world
for that matter

592
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,208
and in accordance with
Ventaxian legal precedent

593
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,792
I call for an
arbitration.

594
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:29,041
An arbitration?

595
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,583
There's nothing
here to arbitrate.

596
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,083
PICARD:
Oh, but there is.

597
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,375
You're a fraud, madam,
and I intend to prove

598
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:35,875
that you could
not have effected

599
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:37,875
the changes that took
place on this planet.

600
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:39,041
Do you not believe
what you see

601
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,792
with your own eyes?

602
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:42,375
Your ship is
gone, Captain.

603
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:43,792
An illusion.

604
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:44,875
Magicians have been
making things of all sort

605
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:46,125
disappear for ages.

606
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:48,083
Oh, you underestimate me

607
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:51,750
but then, most people do,
until it's too late.

608
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:54,208
But if you are
who you say you are

609
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,500
then you have
nothing to lose.

610
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:57,083
I also have
nothing to gain.

611
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:59,417
I already have possession
of this planet

612
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,917
and your ship.

613
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:06,125
I am prepared to offer
an added incentive.

614
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:09,125
If you win...

615
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:12,291
I'll take you to the
ruins of Ligillium.

616
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,125
The Zaterl emerald?

617
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,291
You know where it is?

618
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,792
Yes, I do.

619
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,583
Oh...

620
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,125
You are too
clever, Captain

621
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,792
but I have
enough jewels.

622
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:31,291
If you wish
this foolish arbitration

623
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:34,250
I will choose my own prize.

624
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:36,041
And what
would that be?

625
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,500
You.

626
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:46,834
By all rights, your
body is already mine

627
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,417
but I want more.

628
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:51,500
I want your heart,
your mind, your soul

629
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,166
and I want you to give them
to me without resistance

630
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:56,834
of your own free will.

631
00:29:56,875 --> 00:30:00,041
So, do you still
wish to pursue

632
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,875
this most dangerous game?

633
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,041
I agree to your terms.

634
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:12,500
Oh, Picard, I will
enjoy you morning,
noon and night.

635
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:17,375
But... we must agree
to an arbitrator.

636
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:18,750
Very well.

637
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:24,041
I choose Mr. Data.

638
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,208
Any objections?

639
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,834
But Mr. Data is a member
of my crew.

640
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:30,083
Of<i> my</i> crew

641
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,834
and he's an android.

642
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:35,041
He is incapable
of deceit or bias.

643
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:39,000
He has no feelings to get
in the way of his judgment.

644
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:41,542
Ardra, before
he responds

645
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,083
may I have a word
in private with
Captain Picard?

646
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,875
Sir, I request
you reject me
as an arbitrator.

647
00:30:57,917 --> 00:30:58,959
Why?

648
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,291
Ardra is right.

649
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:02,208
If I am chosen, I will
perform my duties

650
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,208
without bias or sentiment.

651
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,417
I cannot guarantee

652
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:09,250
I will deliver
a verdict in your favor.

653
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:11,417
Data, where else on this planet

654
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:14,709
can I find someone
she cannot intimidate?

655
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,500
Sir, I will have to follow
the rules of conduct

656
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,834
for a Ventaxian jurist.

657
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,458
I understand.

658
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,875
You'll make a fine judge.

659
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:29,333
1,000 years ago,
our planet was dying.

660
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,250
Overcrowded and dangerous
city-states

661
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:33,291
warred unceasingly
with each other.

662
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:36,291
The air and water were polluted
with industrial waste

663
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:39,458
and there was a constant threat
of starvation and epidemic.

664
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,083
Then what happened?

665
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:43,291
And then... you came.

666
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:44,709
Objection.

667
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,208
There is no conclusive evidence
that this woman

668
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,000
ever visited
this planet 1,000 years ago.

669
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:52,875
And I suppose you want
a thousand-year-old witness?

670
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:55,125
That would be acceptable.

671
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:58,417
Jared, in the contract
does it specify

672
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,750
how you would know me
when I return?

673
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:03,333
Yes, by the date.

674
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:04,917
Anything else?

675
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:09,208
By the shaking of the cities
and by the visions.

676
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,417
And all of these
occurred on schedule?

677
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,792
Yes.

678
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:15,542
Thank you.

679
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:19,250
Your Honor, I submit that I
have established my identity

680
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:22,375
as stated
by the contract.

681
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:23,959
Captain Picard

682
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,792
my interpretation
of Ventaxian law

683
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:30,041
suggests that,
under these circumstances

684
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,500
this is acceptable.

685
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:33,959
Your objection is overruled.

686
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,959
But, Your Honor...

687
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,417
Sir

688
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:38,542
I have ruled.

689
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:39,875
Please sit down.

690
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:46,834
You may proceed.

691
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,792
Thank you, Your Honor.

692
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,917
Now, when I first
set foot on Ventax II

693
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:54,291
what did I offer
your people?

694
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,875
According to the scrolls

695
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:58,458
you offered us 1,000 years
of peace and prosperity

696
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
if we would promise
to surrender ourselves to you

697
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:02,125
at the end of the term.

698
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:05,000
And why do you think they
would strike such a bargain?

699
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,875
We had nothing to lose.

700
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:08,792
There was no hope in sight.

701
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:10,125
Until I came along.

702
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,166
Objection!

703
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:13,250
I withdraw the
observation.

704
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,875
No further questions.

705
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:22,750
Your Honor, nothing in this
testament proves that Ardra

706
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,917
had the power to affect
the lives of the Ventaxians.

707
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:28,583
My opponent has failed
to prove her case

708
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:31,417
and I move that her claim
be summarily dismissed.

709
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:35,125
I find no cause to invalidate
the contract at this time.

710
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:37,917
The arbitration
will continue.

711
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:43,250
Your Honor, Captain Picard,
as a new visitor to my planet

712
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,834
has been a consistent doubter
of my abilities.

713
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:46,875
I would like
to ask<i> him</i>

714
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:48,667
a few questions,
if I may.

715
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:49,917
DATA:
It is highly
irregular

716
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:52,083
to question
the opposing advocate

717
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:54,083
but I see no reason to deny it.

718
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:56,000
Proceed.

719
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,917
Please do not take any offense
to these questions, Captain.

720
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,834
You know how fond I am of you.

721
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,041
Objection.

722
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,542
Sustained.

723
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,500
The advocate will refrain
from expressing

724
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:07,583
personal affections
for her opponent.

725
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:13,291
You do not believe
my powers are real, do you?

726
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,166
No, I don't.

727
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:18,959
Then, sir, may I ask you
to explain this?

728
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,417
(<i> rumbling</i> )

729
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:27,417
You are out of order.

730
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,041
Or this?

731
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:36,667
The advocate will refrain from
making her opponent disappear.

732
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:41,375
Or this?

733
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,875
(<i> growls</i> )

734
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:47,125
Can you explain it, Picard?

735
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,834
Any more disruptions

736
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,125
and I will rule you
in contempt of court.

737
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:52,834
Is that understood?

738
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,542
I am sorry, Your Honor

739
00:34:56,583 --> 00:35:00,792
but can you
explain it, Picard?

740
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:02,750
Yes or no?

741
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:05,667
No.

742
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,041
I rest my case, Your Honor.

743
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,542
(<i> chuckles</i> )

744
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:25,000
The decay rate
of these Z-particles

745
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:28,125
make it almost impossible
to trace the source.

746
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:30,333
I'm correlating
the particle trajectories.

747
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:33,083
They're beginning to align.

748
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,458
Wait a minute.

749
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,000
(<i> chuckling</i> )

750
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,709
I have coordinates.

751
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:43,375
34 degrees north, 62 degrees
east, at an altitude

752
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:46,500
of 210 kilometers.

753
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:48,375
That would
put it in orbit, uh,

754
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:50,625
above the Western
magnetic pole.

755
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:52,000
Running visual scan.

756
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,166
Nothing.

757
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:00,709
Uh-uh. This time,
I don't buy the magic.

758
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,375
Something's got to be there.

759
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,583
Jared, you've described
quite thoroughly

760
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:07,917
the history of your people

761
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:11,875
before and after
Ardra's first visit

762
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:15,834
but I am a little unclear
about the change itself.

763
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:20,333
Did Ardra simply...
snap her fingers

764
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:23,667
and transform the planet
into this paradise?

765
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:25,792
No. The changes
occurred gradually

766
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:27,792
over a long period of time.

767
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:29,500
Did she personally
form the government

768
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:32,834
that so peacefully ruled
this planet for a millennium?

769
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:34,125
No.

770
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,667
Historical records
indicate

771
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:37,000
a council
was convened

772
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:39,417
to assess our options.

773
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:40,875
They drew up
a new constitution

774
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:43,542
which the population
later ratified.

775
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:47,917
I see.
So she advised this council?

776
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,000
No.

777
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,291
No?

778
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:54,375
Then she must have destroyed
all the weapons on the planet.

779
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:57,583
No, our leaders
did that

780
00:36:57,625 --> 00:37:00,417
and they signed a treaty
of non-aggression.

781
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:04,834
Well, then,
let's move on

782
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:07,959
to the environmental gains
on Ventax II.

783
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,291
How were they accomplished?

784
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,625
We shifted
our economy

785
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:15,208
from an industrial
to an agrarian base.

786
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,250
It was more ecologically sound.

787
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:22,458
But Ardra must have purified
the polluted water and air.

788
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,166
No, the record shows

789
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:27,709
there were a series of
initiatives covering everything

790
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,333
from atmospheric contaminants
to... waste disposal.

791
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:36,792
Did she not even pick up
one piece of trash?

792
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,166
Ardra had left Ventax II

793
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:41,250
before the environmental
reforms began.

794
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:45,750
Forgive me,
but it sounds as if...

795
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:49,250
with a lot of courage
and hard work

796
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:55,000
your ancestors changed
this world all by themselves.

797
00:37:55,041 --> 00:38:00,333
Objection. The advocate
is drawing conclusions.

798
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:02,750
Sustained. I will
draw my own conclusions

799
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:06,625
if you do not mind... sir.

800
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:07,959
No further questions.

801
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,000
Rebuttal?

802
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,875
Just two questions.

803
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:19,625
Is there any doubt
in your mind

804
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:23,583
any doubt at all-- that if I
had not intervened

805
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:24,792
the terrible conditions here

806
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:27,458
would have
continued?

807
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,458
I remind you
that you're under oath.

808
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,375
No doubt at all.

809
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:37,542
Then, as former head of state
for the Ventaxian people

810
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,667
you are satisfied
that I fulfilled

811
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:41,166
my part of the bargain?

812
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:45,417
Yes, Ardra.

813
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,208
Thank you.

814
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,917
Your Honor,
what more can be said?

815
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,291
Both sides agree

816
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,667
the terms of the contract
have been fulfilled.

817
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:56,125
Captain Picard, do you have
any further evidence to present

818
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,333
before I render
judgment?
(<i> door closes</i> )

819
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:02,000
I believe my associate,
Mr. La Forge

820
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:04,291
may be bringing the answer
to that question.

821
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,166
I request
a recess.

822
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:07,166
Hi, Data.

823
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:09,667
Geordi.

824
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:10,959
One hour recess
is granted.

825
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,291
(<i> bangs gavel</i> )

826
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:20,959
(<i> door closes</i> )

827
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,041
Mr. La Forge, my reputation
as a litigator--

828
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,917
not to mention
my immortal soul--

829
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:27,291
is in serious jeopardy.

830
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,542
Well, whatever's been
going on over here

831
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:31,041
gave us exactly
what we needed.

832
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:33,000
Have you identified
the source of her power?

833
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,041
A cloaked ship.

834
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,458
She has a Romulan
cloaking device?

835
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
More likely
a bad copy of one.

836
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,125
We picked it up on
a wavelength stretchout.

837
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:42,333
And the<i> Enterprise?</i>

838
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,333
Exactly where it's
supposed to be.

839
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:46,208
Ardra extended
her cloaking
shields around it--

840
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,667
set up a subspace
damping field

841
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:49,625
to interfere with
normal operations.

842
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,208
I've isolated
the frequency spread

843
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,625
and penetrated
the field.

844
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:53,667
Can you make contact?

845
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:56,500
Already have.

846
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:58,291
This is
what I want to do

847
00:39:58,333 --> 00:39:59,917
but we have
less than an hour...

848
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:09,542
Jared, you are a wise
and experienced leader

849
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,500
and I assume that you
trust your senses.

850
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,041
Yes, I would say so.

851
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:16,000
And all your senses tell you
that this woman here

852
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:19,083
is the most powerful force
on this planet, don't they?

853
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,542
Yes.

854
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:23,583
And what would you say
if I were to tell you

855
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:27,208
that she has no powers
whatsoever?

856
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,750
But we have seen her powers
here.

857
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:30,875
ARDRA:
That's right

858
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,500
and you will again.

859
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:36,750
Oh, yes-- Ardra's magic.

860
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:38,375
Jared, would you believe me

861
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:41,667
if I told you
that I could steal her powers

862
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:43,583
and perform
the same magic acts

863
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,041
as she does?

864
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:49,667
I'm sorry, Captain Picard,
but you are not Ardra.

865
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:51,959
No, that's true.

866
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,375
I'm not Ardra

867
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:58,291
but I can create tremors
just as she did.

868
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:01,000
(<i> rumbling</i> )

869
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,583
Objection, Your Honor.

870
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:06,125
I think he deserves
some leeway.

871
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:07,500
Overruled.

872
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:09,583
But that will be
quite enough, Captain.

873
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:11,250
Of course.

874
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:13,959
Ardra, will you do the honors
and stop the tremors?

875
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,041
Uh... of course.

876
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:20,959
Is something the matter?

877
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,917
I like the tremors.

878
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:25,875
Well, I don't.

879
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:27,375
PICARD:
Do you recognize

880
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:30,166
the same old
bag of tricks?

881
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,458
What about this one?

882
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,875
Come back, Ardra,
if you can.

883
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,417
No?

884
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:38,792
Fine. Allow me.

885
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,000
Of all the impudence.

886
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:46,208
Impudence?

887
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,667
Impudence is pretending

888
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:52,333
to be<i> Fek'lhr</i>
of Klingon.

889
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:54,125
Your leeway
has run out, Captain.

I appreciate

00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:14,375
RIKER:
Glad to be of service, sir.

899
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:16,667
They have been
monitoring me on
my communicator.

900
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:19,000
Executing a
prearranged program

901
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,667
on her ship's computer--

902
00:42:20,709 --> 00:42:23,917
a fairly ingenious combination
of force field projection

903
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:27,125
holography and
transporter effects.

904
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:30,291
Ardra controls
her "magic"

905
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:33,875
literally by the
blink of an eye--

906
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:35,875
centuries-old technology.

907
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:37,792
An implant which permits
the movements of her eye

908
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:42,792
to choose and activate
each illusion.

909
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:45,417
Ardra once told us that she
is known by many names.

910
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:48,291
Well, at least in that,
she was being honest.

911
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,458
Her crew have admitted

912
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,917
that she is known
by 23 aliases

913
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:53,583
in this sector
alone.

914
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,291
You had no right.

915
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:58,959
Deceiving innocent people with
her petty schemes for years.

916
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,083
Ventax II must have offered her

917
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:04,291
the greatest opportunity
of her nefarious career.

918
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:07,750
She learned of the myth
of Ardra, studied it

919
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:11,166
and so expertly played
on your fears

920
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:14,834
that your people were ready
to virtually surrender to her.

921
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,083
Your Honor,
under the circumstances

922
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,667
I believe it
is only fair

923
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:27,542
that I release the Ventaxians
from their obligation

924
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:31,208
and I will let them
keep the peace they have

925
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,625
and I will just be on my way.

926
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,875
With the advocate's
withdrawal

927
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:45,458
the contract
is hereby dissolved.

928
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,041
This arbitration
is adjourned.

929
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,750
(<i> bangs gavel</i> )

930
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:51,417
Thank you, Captain Picard.

931
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:52,792
You saved our lives.

932
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:55,458
No, Jared, as I've
tried to tell you

933
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,417
you saved your own
lives a long time ago.

934
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:05,041
Congratulations, sir.

935
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:06,875
Your Honor.

936
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:09,125
(<i> tsking</i> )

937
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:12,583
You would have had
a lot more fun if you'd lost.

938
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:14,750
Till we meet again,
Jean-Luc Picard

939
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:16,625
of the Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

940
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:22,333
