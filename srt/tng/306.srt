No, thanks.

00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,458
I think I've had
enough already.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,458
Yeah.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,542
Yeah, me, too.

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,834
Ooh.

Hmm?

11
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:07,625
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,417
I think I'd
better go back.

13
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,458
Too chilly?

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,750
I can turn down the breeze.

15
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:14,625
No, it's been a

16
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:16,166
Yeah.

17
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:17,583
You're a terrific guy.

18
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:18,750
Yeah.

Oh, knock it off.

24
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,875
This was the final
battle, wasn't it?

25
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:58,291
Mm-hmm. Neither side
expected Orelious IX

26
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,000
to be the decisive conflict.

27
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,542
There's not much left,
is there?

28
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,166
The destruction is remarkable

29
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,125

I beg your pardon, Wesley.

33
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,417
Geordi had that big date
with Christi tonight.

34
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,208
He spent days putting together
the perfect program.

35
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,834
Looked like it ended
kind of early.

36
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,458
Uh-oh.

37
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,834

Commander Data
to the Bridge immediately.

38
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,917
Acknowledged.

00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,792
We're picking up a signal.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,834
It would seem to be
an ancient interplanetary code.

42
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,250
Mr. Data?

43
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,542
Confirmed, sir.

44
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,333
Survivors on Orelious IX
after all this time?

45
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,583
Not possible.

46
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,792
Well, hardly possible,
Number One.

47
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:01,750
Lay in a course

48
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:02,917

of the signal.

49
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,333
Approaching source, Captain.

50
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,417
Put it on the viewer.

51
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:31,917
A Promellian Battle Cruiser.

52
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,083
With its Lang cycle

(<i> console beeping</i> )

54
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,083
Sensors indicate
no life signs aboard, Captain.

55
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,709
I should hope not,
Mr. Data.

56
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,542
That ship belongs in a museum.

57
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,125
I'm afraid we're a little late.

58
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:57,709
That call for help
was probably initiated

59
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,417

I would prefer it
if Lieutenant Worf and I

75

were able to run a security
sweep of the ship first...

76
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:14,750
No.

77
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:15,750
Captain's prerogative.

78
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,959
This one's mine.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We have examined
every conceivable risk.

Captain.

00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,000
Ghosts, perhaps?

83
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,792
Number One, have you...

84
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,667
have you never dreamed

85
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:33,750
of climbing
inside the bottle?

86
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,375
Sir?

00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:37,917
The ship in the bottle.

88
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,458
Model airships...

89
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,625
I used to build them
when I was a child.

90

My God

91
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,000
I bet I had a Promellian
Battle Cruiser, too.

You're certain about the
atmospheric conditions, Data?

95
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,166
There is adequate oxygen
for life support, Commander.

96
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,583
It is exactly as they
left it, Number One.

97
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,667
In the bottle.

99
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,875
Oh, good Lord, didn't anybody
here build ships in bottles

100
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:09,542
when they were boys?

101
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,917
I did not play with toys.

102
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,166
I was never a boy.

103
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,458
I did, sir.

104
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,417
Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.

105
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,542
Proceed.

106
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,375
I did. I really did.

107
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,417
Ships in bottles--
it was great fun.

108
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,792
(<i> equipment powering down</i> )

109
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,458
What's that?
Not sure.

110
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,709
The secondary power bus
may need adjusting.

111
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,834
Keep me posted.

112
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:02,500
Extraordinary.

113
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,291
Admirable.

114
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:40,834
They died at their posts.

115
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,542
Hmm...

116
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:59,250
You'd expect a bridge
layout of this era

117
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:03,125
to be clumsy, awkward

118
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,458
but look at this.

119
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:09,417
It's a model of simplicity--
elegant and functional.

120
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,792
They built this craft
for generations

121
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:16,959
and it worked.

122
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:28,208
Don't you have anything
stronger than this, Guinan?

123
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,125
Yes.

124
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,750
Would it help?
No.

125
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:34,625
(<i> sighing heavily</i> ):
Tell me something, Guinan.

126
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:35,875
You're a woman, right?

127
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,959
Yes, I can tell you I'm a woman.

128
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,375
What is it
that you want in a man?

129
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:43,792
You mean me, personally?

130
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,208
As a woman, what's
the first thing you look at?

131
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,709
His head.

132
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,333
Mmm, his mind, of course.

133
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,000
No, his head.

134
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,792
I'm attracted to bald men.

135
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:01,875
Seriously?

136
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,458
Seriously.

137
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,125
Why?

138
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,083
Maybe because

139
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,709
a bald man was kind to me once

140
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,417
when I was hurting.

141
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,583
Took care of me.

142
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,166
Mmm...

143
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,709
I'd like to do that.

144
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,500
Well, I take care of myself
these days.

145
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,709
I mean take care of somebody.

146
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,667
I just don't get it, Guinan.

147
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:24,917
I can field strip

148
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,667
a fusion reactor.

149
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,583
I can realign a
power transfer tunnel.

150
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,667
Why can't I make anything work
with a woman like Christi?

151
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:33,792
It's like I don't know
what to do

152
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:34,917
I don't know what to say.

153
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,709
You're doing fine with me.

154
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,208
You're different.

155
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,834
No, you're different.

156
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,750
But I'm not trying now.

157
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:43,917
That's my point.

158
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,709
What is it, Wes?

159
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,667
The main power return
is acting a little weird.

160
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,041
Define "weird."

161
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:05,500
I'm getting fluctuating
waveguide readings.

162
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,875
Run a maintenance sweep.

163
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:07,959
Right.

164
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,333

00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,834
(<i> distress signal warbling</i> )

166
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:23,041
Mr. Worf, be sure we
get tricorder images

167
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,583
of their tactical display.

168
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,625
Aye, sir.

169
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,959
The source
of the distress signal

170
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,542
appears to be coming
from up there, Captain.

171
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:33,166
(<i> warbling louder</i> )

172
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,583
Let's put an end
to their last cry for help.

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,000
(<i> signal stops</i> )

174
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:49,250
Captain, I believe this is
an information storage device.

175
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,667
A crude analog of our own
isolinear optical chip.

176
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,375
Crude by our standards
today, Data

177
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:56,959
but when this ship was built

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,083
humans on Earth
were just perfecting

179
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,917
the mechanical clock.

180
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,667
They were still using
steel crossbows in battle.

181
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,542
Is there any way to see
what's on this?

182
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,375
Questionable, sir.

183
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:11,458
I believe I can supply power
to its playback unit

184
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,583
but its components
are quite old.

185
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,250
I will attempt

186
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,166
to amplify the image
with my tricorder.

187
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,458
I am Galek Sar

188
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,291
Captain of the Promellian
Cruiser<i> Cleponji.</i>

189
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,625
I wish anyone
who finds this record to know

190
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:38,083
my crew has behaved
courageously.

191
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,625
I want it recorded for all time

192
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:48,792
that I alone am responsible
for the fate that befell us

193
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,875
I have failed-- as a Captain

194
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,709
and as the man responsible

195
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,166
for all the souls
aboard my ship.

196
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,625
Picard to<i> Enterprise.</i>

197
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:04,875
RIKER:
Go ahead, Captain.

198
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,250
I think we have seen
all there is to see here.

199
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:13,000
At Mr. O'Brien's leisure,
we're ready to return.

200
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,125
Aye, sir.

201
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:20,917
Thrilling.

202
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,917
That was absolutely
thrilling.

203
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,458
And I was right,
Number One.

204
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,125
There were ghosts
on board that old ship.

205
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,792
One of them actually
spoke to us.

206
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,208
The friendly one, I hope.

207
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,083
My own counterpart.

208
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,709
The Captain's final message
praising his crew.

209
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,375
I hope you'll be as thoughtful
when the time comes.

210
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:44,125
Mr. Data, advise
the Astral V Annex.

211
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,333
This should be catalogued,
scheduled for retrieval.

212
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,417
Aye, sir.

213
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,500
(<i> chuckles quietly</i> )

214
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,458
I'm sorry, Captain.

215
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,917
It's just a rare pleasure

216
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,750
to see this side
of your personality.

217
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,333
Mr. Crusher, set course
for the original coordinates.

218
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,583
Yes, sir.

219
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,083
Captain, we are experiencing

220
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,583
a two percent drop
in energy reserves.

221
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,917
Compensating.

222
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:13,959
We were having
some problems while...

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,709
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

224
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,625
Readouts indicate
we are being bombarded

225
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,291
with a field
of high-intensity radiation.

226
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,792
Shields up.

227
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:24,291
Captain, energy loss
increasing to five percent.

228
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:26,500
Yellow Alert.

229
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:27,625
WORF:
Aye, sir.

230
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,917
Energy loss increasing, sir.

231
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,000
Mr. Crusher...

232
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:36,959
reverse course.

233
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,291
Full impulse power.

234
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,208
No response, sir.

235
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,166
Increase speed to warp one.

236
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:49,917
Engines aren't responding,
Captain.

237
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:50,917
Mr. La Forge

238
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,583
we need warp power now.

239
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,583
Matter/anti-matter
mixture ratio settings

240
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,375
at optimum balance.

241
00:14:57,417 --> 00:15:01,583
Reaction sequence corresponding
to specified norms.

242
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,083
Magnetic plasma transfer
to warp field generators

243
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,667
per program specs.

244
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:08,792
Commander, we should be going
like a bat out of hell.

245
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,083
Power loss now at 12 percent,
Captain.

246
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,500
Red Alert.

247
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,750
Radiation intensity
increasing.

248
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:17,583
LA FORGE:
We'd better slow
these engines down

249
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,834
before we burn out
the reaction chamber.

250
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,041
Slow to idle, Geordi.

251
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,542
Is it possible?

252
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,834
Have we fallen into the same
snare that killed them?

253
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,792
A thousand-year-old booby trap?

254
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,125
With engines idling, the energy
loss has been limited

255
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,458
but our reserves
will be depleted

256
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,083
in less than three hours.

257
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,959
We won't be able to hold
our shields in place.

258
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,291
Mr. Worf, have you been able

259
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,208
to identify the source
of the radiation?

260
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,333
No, sir.

261
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,083
The radiation field
is so strong

262
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,834
it interferes with our sensors.

263
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,875
And no apparent explanation
for the energy loss?

264
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,417
No, sir.

265
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,583
Is there anything
in the history books, Data

266
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,083
that could give us a clue?

267
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,333
There are many
fascinating records

268
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,333
of Menthar battle strategy.

269
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,166
They were exceptionally
innovative.

270
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,458
In fact, they were
the first to use

271
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,667
the Kavis Teke elusive maneuver

272
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,458
as well
as the Passive Lure stratagem

273
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,834
which is comparable
to Napoleon's...

274
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,458
Any mention
of a situation like this?

275
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:26,333
No, sir.

276
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,959
I recommend that I return to
the Cruiser with an away team.

277
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
They didn't have
much success

278
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,250
with this problem, Commander.

279
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,250
No, but they knew
who their enemy was

280
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,625
better than we do.

281
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,166
They may have known
what caused the trouble.

282
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,709
They just didn't know
how to get out of it.

283
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,834
Agreed.

284
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,458
Mr. Worf, what would be
the impact

285
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,834
of lowering the shields
long enough to get

286
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,834
the away team out?

287
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,375
Negligible.

288
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,792
Won't do much for our energy
conservation, Captain.

289
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,583
That's your job,
Commander La Forge.

290
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,875
Determine some way to keep
the<i> Enterprise</i> up and running.

291
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,792
Data, you join Commander Riker
on the away team.

292
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,333
Find out what happened
on that ship.

293
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,500
So, why can't we move?

294
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:09,625
Computer, as we increased
our power levels

295
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:10,834
was there any counterreaction?

296
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,333
Affirmative.

297
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,625
The opposing force grew
in direct proportion

298
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,917
to the power output
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

299
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,083
So it kept us from forming
a subspace field

300
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,750
for the warp drive?

301
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,834
That is correct.

302
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:43,792
Computer, who is this L. Brahms?

303
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,417
Doctor Leah Brahms.
Engineer.

304
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,083
Graduate
of the Daystrom Institute.

305
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:53,583
Theoretical Propulsion Group,
Galaxy-class starships.

306
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,667
Team seven, junior member.

307
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,792
<i>Junior</i> member?

308
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:00,959
Looks like she wrote the book
on propulsion.

309
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,709
Call up subspace design logs.

310
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,125

Author: Leah Brahms.

317
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,208
Geordi La Forge.

318
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,417
How you doing, Doc?

319
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,000
Specify program.

320
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,125
Yeah, down to work.

321
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,208
You're absolutely right.

322
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,208
I recommend we evacuate
and seal-off

323
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,375
all non-operational areas,
and group the families and crew

324
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:43,500
on the odd-numbered decks.

325
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:44,500
Proceed.

326
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:45,875
I'd also like to set up

327
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,709
an assembly area
for treating radiation symptoms

328
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,041
in case it's needed.

329
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,166
After the shields fall,
how long before fatal exposure?

330
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,291
30 minutes.

331
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,542
After that, there is
nothing that can be done.

332
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,083
RIKER:
Away team to<i> Enterprise.</i>

333
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,291
Captain, we may have
found something.

334
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,917
There's a file
of memory coils here.

335
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:07,875
They are identical to the coil
we found earlier, Captain.

336
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,834
The Captain's log, perhaps?

337
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,417
That's what we were thinking.

338
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,625
Mr. Data, are they
in working condition?

339
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,041
I believe so, sir.

340
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,667
We can enhance them
through the image processor

341
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:18,417
in the ship's computer.

342
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,625
Good. Return at once.

343
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:20,834
RIKER:
Aye, sir.

344
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,667
Computer, generate
a cross-section image

345
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:25,917
of the dilithium crystal
chamber.

346
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,583
What about...
reorienting the crystal?

347
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,542
BRAHMS:
It is possible
to reorient the crystal.

348
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,792
The key lies in adjusting
the lattice structure direction.

349
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:43,959
This modification
will be integrated

350
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,875
into the next class starship.

351
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,125
Sorry, can't wait.

352
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,417
You and me, Leah,
we got just two hours

353
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,625
to figure this thing out.

(<i> sighs</i> )

355
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,291
You know what I need to do?

356
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,166
I need to get inside there.

357
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:05,000
I need to be able
to turn that thing inside out.

358
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,083
Computer, is there
a cross-section image

359
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,458
we can replicate on a holodeck?

00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,083
at Utopia Planitia,
Drafting Room 5

365
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:27,542
of the Mars Station,
Stardate 40174.

366
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,542
Perfect.

367
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,750
Recreate it in Holodeck Three.

368
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:30,875
Stay with me, Doc.

369
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,875
Ready, computer?

370
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:45,041
Holodeck Three program is ready.

371
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,625
Damn...

372
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,417
Right back where it all started.

373
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,834
Oh, this is incredible.

374
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,083
Leah, did you design this?

375
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,667
BRAHMS:
The dilithium crystal chamber

376
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:29,125
was designed at outpost
designated Seran-T-One

377
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,834
Stardate 40052.

378
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,208
Some of the Federation's
best engineering minds

379
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,375
participated in its development.

380
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:38,750
That's the visiting dignitary
talk.

381
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,542
What's the inside story?

382
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,959
Off the record.

383
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,625
COMPUTER:
Access denied.

384
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,291
Personal logs are restricted.

385
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,709
Great.

386
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,208
Another woman
who won't get personal with me

387
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,417
on the holodeck.

388
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,625
Leah, I want to find a way

389
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:57,500
to supplement the energy supply
to the ship<i> and</i> to the engines.

390
00:21:57,542 --> 00:22:01,750
Could we alter
the matter/anti-matter paths?

391
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,291
BRAHMS:
Theoretically, yes.

392
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,583
The system should be able
to accept more reactants

393
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,250
at a faster rate of injection.

394
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,542
Well, this is your baby.

395
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,667
Show me which ones.

396
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,625
Computer, did I ask
for a simulation?

397
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,083
Affirmative.

398
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,625
You asked Dr. Brahms to show you

399
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:41,417
which system could accept
reactants at a faster rate.

400
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,500
By accessing available imagery

401
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,959
an adequate facsimile
was possible.

402
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,458
Hmm, I did do that, didn't I?

403
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,875
Okay, well,
it's good to see you, Leah.

404
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,083
Continue with your analysis.

405
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:05,834
Systems L-452 through L-575

406
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,291
will accept reactants

407
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,291
providing all other systems
are calibrated

408
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,083
to an equal factor.

409
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,959
Then, if we use multiple
injector streams

410
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,834
hitting more than one
crystal facet

411
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,250
we could do it.

412
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,625
We could hold our own.

413
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,041
Leah, you're beautiful.

414
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,083
La Forge to Picard.

415
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,083
Go ahead.

416
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,500
Captain, we've found a way

417
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,917
to extend the matter/anti-matter
energy supplies.

418
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:27,500
Well done, Mr. La Forge.

419
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:29,542
Geordi, can you give us enough
power to get us out of here?

420
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,375
Sorry, Commander, we haven't
addressed that one yet.

421
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,667
First priority was
to maintain the shields.

422
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:35,041
Acknowledged.

423
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,041
We'll get to work on it
right away, sir.

424
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,583
Pass my congratulations
to the rest of your team.

425
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,166
Thanks, Captain.

426
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,667
We're all smiles down here.

427
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:49,166
Captain, we've been
able to verify

428
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,792
that these coils are the logs
of the Promellian Captain

429
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:56,041
but most of them have decayed
and cannot be repaired.

430
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,750
RIKER:
Can you hear any playback
at all?

431
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,750
On most, there are
brief sections

432
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,625
which may yield
some information.

433
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,250
Well, do the best you can, Data.

434
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,625
Let's just hope we can
get the section we need.

435
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,750
PICARD:
Surely he must have logged
the cause of the ship's death.

436
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:12,667
What Captain wouldn't?

437
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,250
They were all found
in an open locker.

438
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,125
I don't think he was
too concerned with security.

439
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:24,959
452 through system L-575.

440
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,583
COMPUTER:
Adjustments to dilithium crystal
chamber complete.

441
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,750
Impact analysis, computer.

442
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:33,542
Warp energy has increased
14 percent.

443
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:36,709
Reactants per unit time
remaining steady.

444
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,375
Yes, all right!

445
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:43,333
(<i> sighs</i> )

446
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,583
Computer, do you have any...

447
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:51,750
you know, personality
on file for Dr. Brahms?

448
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:58,208
Starfleet personality profile
analysis, Stardate 40056.

449
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,750
Did she ever debate
at the intergalactic caucuses

450
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,542
on Chaya VII?

451
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:07,458
Doctor Brahms attended
Chaya VII caucuses

452
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,709
on the following stardates...

453
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,208
Never mind the dates.

454
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,166
Computer, if you add data
from all these sources

455
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:19,208
could you synthesize a true
representation of Dr. Brahms?

456
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:24,250
There would be
a 9.37 percent margin of error

457
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:27,041
in the interactive responses
from the facsimile.

458
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,083
I can live with that.

459
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:32,417
Do it.

460
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:49,667
Dr. Brahms?

461
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:52,125
Geordi, it's me, Leah.

462
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:53,542
Don't start calling me
"Dr. Brahms"

463
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,458
or I'll call you
"Commander La Forge."

464
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,875
Right.

465
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:59,750
Now, we've managed
to maintain energy

466
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,625
but we can't leave it
in this realignment forever

467
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:03,792
without burning out components,
so we need to move quickly.

468
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:08,709
Are you with me?

469
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,333
Uh, yeah.

470
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:11,750
Yeah, yeah.

471
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:23,792
GALEK SAR:
We have been stripped
of all propulsion

472
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,500
and our weapons are useless.

473
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:30,875
We cannot move
and we cannot fight.

474
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,959
The ship is being lashed
with lethal radiation

475
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,250
from the aceton assimilators

476
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:39,417
concealed
in the rubble surrounding...

477
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,250
Aceton assimilators?

478
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,500
Aceton assimilators are
primitive generators

479
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:50,041
which can drain power
from distant sources.

480
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,500
Generators...

481
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:54,291
It would not
be difficult
to modify them

482
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,333
to convert energy
into radiation.

483
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:00,375
The Menthars hide them
in floating debris

484
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:03,291
an unsuspecting ship flies in...

485
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,041
instant booby trap.

486
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,667
And now we're
supplying the devices

487
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,041
with the energy to kill us.

488
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:12,834
No, no, no.

489
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,041
Will you listen to me?

490
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:15,500
You can't boost
the warp power that way.

491
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:16,834
If you can just
increase the speed

492
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,125
of the parallel
subspace field processor

493
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,250
to gain a quicker
response time...

494
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:20,709
I want to give us enough power

495
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,500
to strengthen the shields
and barrel out of here

496
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:23,875
not blow us up.

497
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:25,333
This is my design
we're talking about.

498
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,792
I did the calculations myself.

499
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:28,333
I don't care if you built it
with your bare hands

500
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:30,041
out of an old Ferengi
cargo ship.

501
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,000
It's going to go...

502
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,083
(<i> imitates explosion</i> )

503
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,583
...and we're going
to go with it.

504
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,542
I am not used to having people
question my judgment.

505
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,125
And I'm not
used to dying.

506
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,083
Okay, look.

507
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,792
You worked in a lab
on a static model.

508
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,834
This is a working machine.

509
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,917
It's got tens of thousands
of light years on it.

510
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,959
True.

511
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,083
Damn right.

512
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,250
Listen.

513
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:07,000
We'd never be certain that
the circuit paths are sealed.

514
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,750
You're good.

515
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,458
Very good.

516
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,709
I know my ship--
inside and out.

517
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,583
Well, then you must know me
inside and out

518
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,458
'cause a lot of me is in here.

519
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,291
You know, I
always wished that

520
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,500
a chief engineer
could be present

521
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:34,834
when a ship
is being built.

522
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,250
That's what's wrong
with designers.

523
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,750
We never get out in space.

524
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,500
Well, you're there now.

525
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,875
RIKER:
Commander La Forge
to the Bridge.

526
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,583
On my way, Commander.

527
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,041
Don't go away.

528
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,333
I mean...

529
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,500
Computer, save program.

530
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,709
How many devices do we think
we're dealing with, Mr. Data?

531
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,375
To create this
radiation field

532
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,792
would take several
hundred thousand, sir.

533
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,041
They've been out there
a long time, Data.

534
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,959
There must have been
some deterioration.

535
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,917
There is no way to precisely
calculate that, Commander

536
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:17,959
but it is likely.

537
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,375
Is there
any indication

538
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:21,500
of a weakness
in a specific part of the field?

539
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:22,834
WORF:
Nothing substantial, Captain.

540
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,083
Of any kind?

541
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:26,667
Well, there is a .1 percent dip

542
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:28,333
in the strength
of the radiation field

543
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:32,375
at... 21 mark 8 by 42 mark 0.

544
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:34,125
I want that .1 percent.

545
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,208
I recommend we fire
directional phasers
at those coordinates.

546
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,375
LA FORGE:
We won't be able to maintain

547
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,500
energy reserves.

548
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:39,709
We might even lose
a few circuits

549
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,291
in the new configuration.

550
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,000
How critical will the losses be?

551
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:44,083
Not enough to shut down
our engines

552
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,375
but if we don't make it

553
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,083
I don't know
that I can hold the shields.

554
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,458
There is also the possibility

555
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,625
that the phasers will supply
the assimilators

556
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,667
with what they need most--
energy.

557
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,834
You know, I imagine
a very similar discussion

558
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:58,333
taking place
in our neighbor ship

559
00:29:58,375 --> 00:29:59,875
over a thousand years ago.

560
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:01,166
Well, let's hope our decisions

561
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:02,834
are more successful
than theirs were.

562
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:04,875
Mr. La Forge, I want you
to return to Engineering

563
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:06,667
and continue with your efforts
without delay.

564
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:10,750
Mr. Worf...
prepare the phasers.

565
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,166
Phasers locked
on coordinates.

566
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,458
Fire.

567
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:24,667
Nothing.

568
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:27,500
WORF:
Radiation levels increasing.
Eight percent.

569
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,208
Ten percent.

570
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,041
DATA:
Energy reserves are
dropping rapidly, sir.

571
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,291
Damn you.

572
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,125
Wouldn't that increase
the output

573
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:39,917
of the subspace processors
to gain a quicker response time?

574
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,750
The processors can handle
the extra input.

575
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:43,250
Yeah, but how do we reconfigure?

576
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,333
COMPUTER:
Energy reserves reaching
critical stage.

577
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:51,250
Standard procedure requires
termination of all simulations.

578
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,542
Computer, override
standard procedure.

579
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,667
Override authority restricted.

580
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:57,542
What?

581
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:58,625
Computer!

582
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:12,792
LA FORGE:
The crystal lattice
is breaking down.

583
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:15,291
We'll have to pick up repairs
when we can reach a Starbase.

584
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,083
The optimist
of the group.

585
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,375
How long do we have shields

586
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:20,000
based on current
calculations?

587
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:22,667
Under two hours.

588
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:26,041
And the radiation field
has increased by 17 percent.

589
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,667
So, what impact will that have
on fatal exposure?

590
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:30,750
Down to 26 minutes.

591
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:32,792
If we resist, we die.

592
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:35,125
If we don't resist, we die.

593
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,000
Mr. La Forge, have we shut down
all non-essential energy usage?

594
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:41,166
Yes, sir.

595
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,625
In fact, I need
to get some back.

596
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,667
I'm running a program
on Holodeck Three.

597
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:46,041
For what purpose?

598
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:48,875
Well, I've gone back
to the beginning

599
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:51,291
to the earliest construction
entries of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

600
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,041
I've created a...

601
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,709
well, a propulsion
design model to assist me.

602
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,542
I believe we're making progress.

603
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,208
Computer, reinstate
Holodeck Three program.

604
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,500
Holodeck Three program
is reinstated.

605
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:07,875
Mr. La Forge, your best
suggestion in one hour.

606
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:09,000
Picard out.

607
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:15,417
Computer,
resume Holodeck Three program.

608
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:17,792
Enter when ready.

609
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:21,709
There isn't much time left.

610
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,917
Somehow, we have
to generate

611
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:24,375
enough energy
to get out of here.

612
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:25,500
but we've got
a booby trap

613
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,000
that eats energy
for breakfast.

614
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:29,166
How do we fool it, block it,
shut it down, anything?

615
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:34,417
Okay, we know that for every
move the<i> Enterprise</i> makes

616
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:37,125
there's a countermovement
by the energy field.

617
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:40,000
Can we use that
to our advantage somehow?

618
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,083
Maybe.

619
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,250
There must be
a time differential

620
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,083
between the force
and counterforce.

621
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:46,000
If we can just make quick
continuing adjustments

622
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,792
in the linkups before
the counterforce reacts

623
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:50,583
we might just be able
to move this bucket.

624
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,041
Yeah.

625
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,125
Yes!

626
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:55,583
Leah...

627
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,417
do you like Italian food?

628
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,125
Like it?

629
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,625
Wait till I make
you my fungilli.

630
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:06,750
Okay, fusion reactor uplink
to navigation processor.

631
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:22,750
Hmm, then we have to adjust
the vector processor

632
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,959
and the drive coils.

633
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,458
(<i> growls</i> )

634
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,709
This is impossible!

635
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,000
Mmm... mmm.

636
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,417
Don't do that.

637
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:35,458
I'm sorry.

638
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,792
I thought it
would feel good.

639
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:38,125
I don't want to feel
that good right now.

640
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,875
What time is it?

641
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:43,333
Coming up on 1600 hours.

642
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:45,917
Oh, God, what am I supposed
to tell the Captain?

643
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,125
It's possible
and yet it's not possible.

644
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:52,000
Everything we've done says
we can't adjust that fast

645
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:54,458
but if we could,
it might work.

646
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,000
I could do it.

647
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,667
Data couldn't even do it.

648
00:33:57,709 --> 00:34:00,834
It will take 100, maybe 1,000
adjustments every second.

649
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:01,917
How are you going to do it?

650
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,291
It's humanly impossible.

651
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,417
I'm not human.

652
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:10,542
You, uh...

653
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,917
you mean the computer
could do it?

654
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,625
LA FORGE:
Captain.

655
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,583
Captain, this is, uh...

656
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,000
this is a holographic
simulation of one of
the propulsion experts

657
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,500
who designed the<i> Enterprise</i>
engines, Leah Brahms.

658
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,166
We...<i> I've</i> been examining

659
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,417
the force-counterforce
response times

660
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:36,083
trying to see if we could create
linkage at maximum power.

661
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,667
And?

662
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,083
There's a...

663
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,750
there's a chance we could
maneuver out of this trap

664
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:44,625
<i>if</i> we turn the ship over
to the computer.

665
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:50,417
What kind of a chance?

666
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,125
I don't know yet.

667
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:55,208
But we could program it and try
it out on a few simulated runs.

668
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,834
And this is the only way?

669
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,208
I think so, sir.

670
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,166
(<i> door chimes</i> )

671
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,250
Come.

672
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,125
Any word from La Forge?

673
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:24,500
He's come up with something
that may give us a chance

674
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:26,250
if we agree
to stay out of it.

675
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,834
He proposes to turn
total control of the ship

676
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,458
over to the computer

677
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,041
because<i> it</i> is capable
of making quicker adjustments

678
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,583
than any human being.

679
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:39,500
Computers have
always impressed me

680
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:41,959
with their ability
to take orders.

681
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,166
I'm not nearly as convinced

682
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,542
of their ability
to creatively give them.

683
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,375
You know, Number One

684
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:52,500
you missed something
not playing with model ships.

685
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:57,250
They were the source
of imaginary voyages

686
00:35:57,291 --> 00:36:00,166
each holding a treasure
of adventures.

687
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,333
Manning the earliest spacecraft

688
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,500
flying an aeroplane

689
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:07,625
with only one propeller
to keep you in the sky.

690
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,083
Can you imagine that?

691
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,291
Now the machines are flying us.

692
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:21,583
COMPUTER:
End simulation.

693
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,333
Fatal exposure.

694
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,959
Computer, reduce
thrust levels
another four percent.

695
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,625
Adjust trajectory
angle to compensate.

696
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:34,792
Begin simulation again.

697
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,041
There you go.

698
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,250
We got out.

699
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:43,792
Repeat simulation.

700
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,041
Same levels.

701
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,041
COMPUTER:
End simulation.
Fatal exposure.

702
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,500
See? Same variables

703
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:56,083
only this time, the computer
didn't quite make it.

704
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,208
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

705
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,041
COMPUTER:
Deflector shield failure.

706
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,041
Lethal radiation levels.

707
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:05,208
Fatal exposure in 26 minutes.

708
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,166
It might work, Geordi.
And it might not.

709
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,458
I can't ask Captain Picard

710
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,834
to turn the ship
over to a computer.

711
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,250
It's all we've got.

712
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,250
Picard to La Forge.

713
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:28,542
Captain

714
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:31,208
two minutes--
give me just two minutes.

715
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,291
There<i> is</i> another way, Captain.

716
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,750
Two minutes, please.

717
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,375
Two minutes, Mr. La Forge.

718
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:40,834
Picard out.

719
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,583
Geordi, there's no other way.
No, no, no, wait.

720
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:46,041
Listen, turn it
completely around.

721
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:49,083
Literally-- come at it
from the opposite direction.

722
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:51,875
God, it's so simple,
it might even work.

723
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:54,792
Okay.
Computer, new simulation.

724
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,000
Everything we've
tried to do has been

725
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,792
based on
overpowering the trap--

726
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,750
more energy, faster
adjustments--

727
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:06,208
but that's exactly
what we can't do

728
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,250
because that's what
we're supposed to do.

729
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:09,834
That's the booby trap.

730
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:13,917
The answer lies in our
own computer, the mind.

731
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,125
The best piece
of engineering
we'll ever need.

732
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,792
But didn't your researches
indicate

733
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:20,667
a thousand adjustments
per second will be required?

734
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:22,583
But not if we shut
everything off.

735
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:27,291
One blast of everything we've
got left for a microsecond

736
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,375
to beat the inertia, and
then we shut it all down

737
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:33,458
except for minimal life
support and two thrusters.

738
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,250
No impulse engines,
no computer.

739
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:37,625
One propeller, Captain?

740
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,500
COMPUTER:
Deflector shield failure.

741
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:41,417
Lethal radiation levels.

742
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:44,166
Fatal exposure in 12 minutes.

743
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:46,625
Have you analyzed
the risk factor?

744
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,583
The numbers say it's even money.

745
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,250
It's no better than turning it
over to the computer

746
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:51,709
but no worse either.

747
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,750
But I say forget the numbers.

748
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:54,291
There's no way the computer

749
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:57,083
can compensate for the human
factor-- the intuition

750
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,333
the experience.

751
00:38:58,375 --> 00:38:59,709
And the wish to stay alive.

752
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:14,792
Make it so.

753
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:16,125
I've run the
simulations, Captain.

754
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,125
If you want,
I'll take the conn.

755
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:20,208
Thank you, Mr. La Forge,
but you've done your job.

756
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,667
Now I must do mine.

757
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,083
I relieve you, Mr. Crusher.

758
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:28,000
Yes, sir.

759
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,792
(<i> bosun's whistle blows</i> )

760
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:35,500
All hands,
this is Commander Riker.

761
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:38,417
We are about to engage impulse
engines for a short burst.

762
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,458
Inertial dampeners
are on manual.

763
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,000
They may not fully compensate
for the acceleration

764
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,542
so brace yourselves.

765
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,959
COMPUTER:
Deflector shield failure.

766
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,500
Lethal radiation levels...

767
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,875
Computer, discontinue
radiation warning

768
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,417
until further notice.

769
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,083
It's all yours, sir.

770
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,333
Thank you, Number One.

771
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:05,166
Firing impulse engines.

772
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:17,709
Impulse engines are down.

773
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,792
Shutting down all systems.

774
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,083
(<i> equipment powering down</i> )

775
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:31,625
Velocity is 135 meters
per second.

776
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,917
(<i> console beeping</i> )

777
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:36,667
We will be entering the debris
field in eight seconds.

778
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:50,875
Starboard thruster firing.

779
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:58,083
RIKER:
Coming to heading 340 mark 10.

780
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:02,959
DATA:
Thruster is off.

781
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,625
RIKER:
Captain, that large mass
to the port

782
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,125
may contain an assimilator.

783
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:10,583
DATA:
Port thruster is firing.

784
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:18,291
WORF:
No reaction
from the assimilator.

785
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,583
We made it
over the first hurdle.

786
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,500
(<i> console beeping</i> )

787
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:27,667
Sir, object to port.

788
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:31,583
DATA:
Port thruster is firing.

789
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,917
Sir, the gravitational
attraction

790
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,250
of the various masses

791
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:39,125
has reduced our velocity
by eight percent.

792
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,875
By my calculations

793
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:42,333
we no longer have
sufficient momentum

794
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,750
to clear the
debris field.

795
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,917
Thank you, Mr. Data.

796
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:53,625
The asteroid's gravitation
is drawing us closer.

797
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:54,959
Velocity is increasing.

798
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:06,709
DATA:
Velocity is still
increasing.

799
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,834
Now at 219 meters per second.

800
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:18,500
DATA:
Starboard aft thruster.

801
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,125
You have used the asteroid's
gravitational pull

802
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:34,333
as a slingshot.

803
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:36,959
Excellent.

804
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:43,083
We're out.

805
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:44,458
We got through.

806
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,917
You have the conn, Mr. Crusher.

807
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:49,041
Yes, sir.

808
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:50,333
PICARD:
Initiate full restart.

809
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:51,458
Put all systems back on line.

810
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,834
LA FORGE:
With pleasure, sir.

811
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:55,834
Number One, make sure
that booby trap

812
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,875
doesn't bother
anyone again.

813
00:42:57,917 --> 00:43:00,375
Mr. Worf, ready
photon torpedoes.

814
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:03,709
Set to detonate on impact
with the Promellian vessel.

815
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,834
Aye, sir.

816
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,917
You know, I've always thought

817
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:14,750
that technology could solve
almost any problem.

818
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,125
It enhances the quality
of our lives.

819
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:22,291
Lets us travel
across the galaxy.

820
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,750
It even gave me
my vision.

821
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:29,291
But sometimes you just
have to turn it all off--

822
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:30,750
even the gypsy violins.

823
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:33,458
Violins?

824
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:36,250
Different program.

825
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:43,583
We made a good team.

826
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:44,583
Mmm.

827
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:45,792
Mm-hmm.

828
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,917
Maybe we can do it again
sometime.

829
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,125
Oh...

830
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:52,208
I'm with you every day, Geordi.

831
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:55,333
Every time you look
at this engine

832
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:57,166
you're looking at me.

833
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:59,458
Every time you touch it,
it's me.

834
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,333
Computer, exit holodeck.

835
00:44:24,917 --> 00:44:25,959
End program.
