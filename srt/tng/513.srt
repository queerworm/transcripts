00:00:01,917 --> 00:00:05,166
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45470.1:</i>

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:07,875
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has been</i>
<i>diverted to the Moab sector</i>

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,959
<i>to track</i>
<i>a stellar core fragment</i>

4
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:12,250
<i>of a disintegrated</i>
<i>neutron star.</i>

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,041
<i>Our science teams</i>
<i>have been asked to monitor</i>

6
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:17,417
<i>the planetary disruptions</i>
<i>it may cause.</i>

7
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,125
We've got a problem.

8
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,250
Our core fragment is going to
pass by Moab IV in six days.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,333
Isn't that exactly
what we anticipated?

10
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,875
We didn't anticipate there
would be someone living there.

11
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,917
An artificial environment
has been constructed

12
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:30,458
on the southern
continent, sir.

13
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,041
You've definitely
established

14
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,709
that there is
someone inside it?

15
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:35,875
Yes, Captain, sensors are
reading human life-forms.

16
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,375
Human?

17
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,750
Are they responding
to our hails, Mr. Worf?

18
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,500
Negative, sir.

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,041
Any starships reported missing
in this sector, Mr. Data?

20
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,709
No, sir.

21
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:48,375
How the hell did they find
themselves on a deserted planet?

22
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,417
LA FORGE: I'm pretty sure
they know we're here.

23
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,083
Mr. La Forge?

24
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,625
Our sensors are picking up
deep E-M readings.

25
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,542
Looks like wave patterns from
an obsolete subspace relay.

26
00:00:57,542 --> 00:00:59,417
Which would suggest
they also have the ability

27
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:01,333
to communicate with us.

28
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,166
Mr. Worf, open the lower
band frequencies

29
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,917
most commonly used
in the last century.

30
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,667
Channel open.

31
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:12,375
This is Captain
Jean-Luc Picard

32
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:16,041
of the Federation starship
<i>Enterprise.</i>

33
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,625
It is urgent
that you respond.

34
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,542
Sir, the defensive shield
around the structure

35
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:24,166
is increasing strength.

36
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,375
Not exactly
a welcome mat.

37
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:29,000
We mean you no harm.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,500
We must warn you

39
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,125
that your planet
is about to experience

40
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,375
massive seismic disruptions

41
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,375
due to an approaching
stellar core fragment.

42
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:41,291
No structure will be able
to withstand them.

43
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:46,500
They are responding.

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,375
PICARD:
On screen.

45
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,500
<i>Enterprise,</i> 
I am Aaron Conor.

46
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,458
PICARD:
Mr. Conor, we were unaware

47
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,750
that there were human colonies
in this system.

48
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't want to be rude,
Captain,

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,667
but we don't wish
to interact with outsiders.

50
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:04,208
I'm only responding
because of your warning.

51
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,208
The fragment will have
serious effects

52
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,333
on your planet
within six days.

53
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,291
Yes, I know.
We have been tracking it.

54
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,500
But our biosphere
is constructed

55
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,875
to withstand quakes of 8.7
on the Richter scale.

56
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,166
Mr. Data?

57
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,834
The fragment has a density

58
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:23,208
of 100 billion kilograms
per cubic centimeter.

59
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,750
As a result,
when it passes Moab IV,

60
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,875
it will cause
tectonic shifts

61
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,667
well beyond 8.7
on the Richter scale.

62
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm afraid we are going to have
to evacuate your people.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,750
Evacuate?
That is not possible.

64
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,792
There must be an alternative.

65
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,417
Well, we will
gladly explore

66
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,417
the possibility of it
with you Mr. Conor.

67
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,542
Would you like to
come aboard to discuss it?

68
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,500
Our environment is sealed.

69
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,583
No one can get in or out.

70
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:51,166
We are capable of
matter/energy transport.

71
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,166
Matter/energy?

72
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,000
We can take you directly
through the structure.

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,166
Really?

74
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,166
That's quite remarkable.

75
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,166
May we arrange
for your transport?

76
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:05,166
No. I must remain here.

77
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,125
But under the circumstances,

78
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,041
I will permit
a small delegation

79
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,333
from your ship
inside the biosphere,

80
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,667
if only to see this

81
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,375
matter/energy transportation
you speak of.

82
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,041
PICARD: Very good.

83
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,875
Commander Riker and an away team
will be with you shortly.

84
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,333
Picard out.

85
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,959
This is a mistake, Aaron.

86
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,250
Good Lord, Martin,
what would you have me do?

87
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,417
Anything that would
keep them out of here.

88
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:34,792
We have nothing to hide.

89
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:37,375
We have a great deal
to lose.

90
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,542
What is that?
It's them.

91
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,125
Look at this, Martin.

92
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,750
Incredible.

93
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:24,709
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

94
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,792
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

95
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:30,875
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

96
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,375
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

97
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:38,792
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

98
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:43,333
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

99
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,834
TROI:
It's lovely.

100
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:45,208
I can understand why you're
reluctant to leave, Mr. Conor.

101
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,166
Not just reluctant,
Ms. Troi,

102
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,792
it is imperative
that we remain.

103
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,834
It would be suicide
to evacuate.

104
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,083
It would destroy
everything we have worked

105
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,834
for two centuries
to accomplish.

106
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,959
You see this is
an engineered society.

107
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,709
Engineered?
Genetically engineered.

108
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:03,542
Our ancestors came from Earth
to create a perfect society.

109
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:06,625
They believed that through
controlled procreation,

110
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,917
they could create
people without flaws

111
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:11,875
and those people
would build a paradise.

112
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,291
All of you have been
selectively bred?

113
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,750
Your DNA patterns chosen?

114
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,417
Eight generations of us.

115
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:22,333
We have immeasurably extended
the potential of humanity--

116
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,291
physically, psychologically.

117
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,792
We have evolved beyond...

118
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:31,083
beyond...
beyond us.

119
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,834
Frankly, yes.

120
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:37,625
No one in this society
would be blind, for example.

121
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,291
No offense intended.

122
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,542
I can see you just fine, sir.

123
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:45,166
Yes, well,
my point was just...

124
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,458
Thank you, Martin.

125
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,917
Perhaps you've also
made it clear

126
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:49,542
there are still
a few imperfections

127
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,750
we're working on.

128
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,583
For the most part,

129
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,709
we have achieved
a fully integrated existence,

130
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:59,291
not just among ourselves,
but with our environment.

131
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,333
We don't just live here,
we're a part of our environment.

132
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,917
It is part of us.

133
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:07,583
Every plant life,
every microscopic life-form

134
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,083
is a part
of the master design.

135
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,458
We cannot separate
ourselves from it

136
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,583
without irreparably altering
who and what we are.

137
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,583
Your presence here
has already begun to affect

138
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,625
the entire balance
of our society.

139
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,333
If we don't survive,

140
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,583
the balance
of our society

141
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,709
won't mean a great deal,
will it?

142
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,125
I apologize,

143
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,375
but he is performing
his function

144
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,834
as he is designed to do.

145
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,834
LA FORGE:
And what function might that be?

146
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,875
CONOR: He is the interpreter
of our founders' intentions

147
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,291
for the society.

148
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,458
A judge.
Yes. More or less.

149
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,417
Obviously, he has
no diplomatic talents.

150
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,583
And obviously,
you do.

151
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:57,333
CONOR:
I have been bred to fill
this specific role.

152
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:01,291
We grow up knowing exactly
what our society needs from us,

153
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,208
what we are expected to do.

154
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,834
RIKER: That must take some
of the fun out of it.
Not at all.

155
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,542
My entire
psychological makeup

156
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:10,250
tells me that
I was born to lead.

157
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,709
I am exactly what
I would choose to be.

158
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:14,709
Think of it another way.

159
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:16,417
Are there still people
in your society

160
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:18,542
who have not yet discovered
who they really are

161
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,875
or what they were meant
to do with their lives?

162
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,834
They may be
in the wrong job.

163
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:25,583
They may be writing
bad poetry. 

164
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,375
Or worse yet,
they may be great poets

165
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,000
working as laborers,
never to be discovered.

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,458
That does not happen here.

167
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,500
It is, for us,
an ideal existence

168
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
and we will not
give it up easily.

169
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,208
We will do whatever we can
to help you preserve it.

170
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,000
Hannah, I'd like you
to meet our guests.

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,834
Oh, yes, of course,
from the starship.

172
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,083
I've been looking forward
to speaking with you.

173
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,250
CONOR:
Hannah Bates is
one of our scientists.

174
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,125
If there's any way
to sure up our defenses,

175
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,667
Hannah will find it.

176
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:14,417
She has a remarkable talent
in theoretical physics.

177
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:16,959
I've worked up
a few schematics

178
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,041
based on
gravimetric potentials

179
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,083
and deflector
energy allocation.

180
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,458
Geordi, Troi, and I will
return to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

181
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,875
When you've reached a
conclusion, you can contact us.

182
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,000
Commander,
if Mr. Conor doesn't mind,

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,542
I'd like to stay and see
more of his colony.

184
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:33,041
No, no.
That would be fine.

185
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,542
I'd like you to see it.

186
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:38,250
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i> 
One to beam up.

187
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,083
ENSIGN:
Acknowledged, Commander.

188
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,917
Energize.

189
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,417
Are you sure my being here

190
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:53,250
is not going to be...
disruptive?

191
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,834
Disruptive?

192
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,417
You mean what
Martin was saying?

193
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, I certainly
wouldn't wish

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,667
to throw off
your entire<i> balance.</i>

195
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,041
Too late.
The damage is done.

196
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,667
Seriously.

197
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,417
I sometimes think that
strict interpreters like Martin

198
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,375
have forgotten
we're still human.

199
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,166
We'll adjust,
accommodate.

200
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,458
There must be other
unexpected events

201
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,250
you have to deal with--

202
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,375
an untimely death,
an accident.

203
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,125
Our geneticists
are able to screen out

204
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,750
any congenital health risks
before conception.

205
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,959
Our population
is diverse enough

206
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,750
to maintain
a genetic balance

207
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,083
in the event
of accidental death,

208
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,583
but very little that is
unexpected occurs here.

209
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,458
Am I making this sound
incredibly dull?

210
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,166
Not at all.

211
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,667
I'll tell you the truth,

212
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,750
but I'll deny it
if you tell Martin.

213
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,834
I found today exhilarating...

214
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,709
meeting you,

215
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:52,583
meeting new people
with new ideas.

216
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,875
I feel the same
about being here.

217
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,417
I'm something of
a student of human nature

218
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,875
and I find this all
fascinating.

219
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,792
A student of human nature?

220
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:06,417
I'm the ship's counselor.
Ahh.

221
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,083
I'm afraid you wouldn't find
much work here, Counselor.

222
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:13,417
I'd book my next vacation
at your hotel if you had one.

223
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,667
Well, in that case,

224
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:18,583
I shall have to
have them build one.

225
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,959
The biosphere's superstructure
will never withstand

226
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,583
the tectonic shocks.

227
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,709
The environment
would be compromised.

228
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,792
That's how I see it.

229
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,333
Your ship...

230
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,709
what kind of energy output
is it capable of generating?

231
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:41,458
We have a matter/anti-matter
warp reaction system--

232
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,083
the most powerful in Starfleet.

233
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,166
Normally kicks plasma up
into the terawatt range.

234
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,500
Why?

235
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,041
Well, either we're
going to have to move,

236
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,917
or that fragment is...
(<i> chuckling</i> )

237
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:54,208
We can move a small moon
or an asteroid,

238
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,291
but a stellar core fragment?

239
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,667
That's much too massive
for our tractor beam.

240
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,000
What's that?
A wild idea.

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,250
Purely theoretical.

242
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,166
A multi-phase tractor beam?

243
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,375
When we first spotted
the fragment approaching,

244
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,500
I came up with the idea,

245
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,041
but we can't generate the kind
of energy we would need.

246
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,750
You can.

247
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,291
LA FORGE:
We'd need Hannah on the ship.
MARTIN: No.

248
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,250
HANNAH: With my theories
and their equipment,

249
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,417
we might be able to alter
the fragment's path.

250
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:46,583
It's our only chance
to avoid evacuation.

251
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,583
No one had ever come here

252
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,375
and no one had
ever left until today.

253
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,375
This is a date to note
in our history books.

254
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,333
This is in
direct violation

255
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,208
of the intentions
of our founders, Aaron.

256
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,709
I don't think they
intended us to die, Martin.

257
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:03,959
Her absence will create
an additional imbalance.

258
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,333
Temporarily.

259
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,792
Circumstances require us
to be flexible.

260
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:11,792
We have no idea how molecular
transport will affect her DNA.

261
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,375
It won't affect
her DNA at all.

262
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,291
There's been over a century
of evidence to prove that.

263
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,208
You can go, Hannah.

264
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,625
May I return later?

265
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,667
I look forward to it.

266
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,959
<i>Enterprise,</i> 
three to beam up.

267
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,458
Energize.

268
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,458
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental:</i>

269
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,208
<i>Commander La Forge and Hannah</i>
<i>Bates have spent three days</i>

270
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,000
<i>trying to find a way to adjust</i>
<i>the path of the core fragment.</i>

271
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,542
<i>If they do not succeed</i>
<i>in the next 48 hours,</i>

272
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,542
<i>we will need to</i>
<i>begin evacuation.</i>

273
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:07,375
I believe some will choose
to risk death

274
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,709
rather than leave, Captain.

275
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,458
You've spent a good deal
of time on the surface.

276
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,166
How do you suggest
we change their minds?

277
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,625
I'm not sure we can.

278
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:20,750
It would mean abandoning
their fundamental way of life.

279
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,667
They've managed to turn

280
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:25,875
a dubious scientific
endeavor into dogma.

281
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,083
You don't approve
of genetic engineering.

282
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,375
It was a bad idea
whose time has long passed.

283
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,083
They seem to have
made it succeed.

284
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,000
They've given away
their humanity with this

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,750
genetic manipulation.

286
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,709
Many of the qualities
that they breed out--

287
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:50,000
the uncertainty,

288
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,625
self discovery,
the unknown--

289
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:56,083
these are many of the qualities
that make life worth living.

290
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,625
Well, at least to me.

291
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,417
I wouldn't want to
live my life

292
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:03,792
knowing that my future
was written,

293
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:06,208
that my boundaries
had been already set.

294
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,041
Would you?

295
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:12,125
I've asked myself that question
a lot during the past few days.

296
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,125
I don't know.

297
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,875
I doubt it.

298
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,542
Nevertheless,
it's what they believe in,

299
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:25,625
and it won't be an easy matter
to talk them into leaving.

300
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:29,750
This leader of theirs, Conor,
he seems to be a reasonable man.

301
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,959
I find him very reasonable.

302
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,125
Open to suggestions,

303
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,959
thoughtful,
quite disarming.

304
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,500
The perfect administrator.

305
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,834
I'm sure.

306
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,333
Will he leave when he sees
there's no other choice?

307
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,583
I don't know.
I hope so.

308
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,959
You admire him.

309
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,375
Yes.

310
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,750
Then help him to see
the reality

311
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,917
of what may happen
to his colony.

312
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:07,375
If he makes
the right decision--

313
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,500
if he's as good a leader
as he's designed to be--

314
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,417
then perhaps the others
will follow.

315
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:18,208
If we increase the warp power
transfer by 80%...

316
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,250
It's just going to blow
the emitters again.

317
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,917
We won't be able
to reinforce the conduit

318
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,583
to hold that power level.

319
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,041
It just doesn't work.

320
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,792
(<i> frustrated sighing</i> )

321
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,709
I haven't had any sleep
in so long

322
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:34,166
my eyelids feel like they have
lead weights attached to them.

323
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,291
(<i> sighing</i> )

324
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,291
Ahh.

325
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,500
Geordi...
Hmm?

326
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,125
Were you always blind?

327
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,625
I'm sorry.

328
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,959
I probably shocked the hell out
of you, didn't I?

329
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,709
No.
I'll put it back on.

330
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:02,625
Don't. I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to embarrass you.

331
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,542
I've never been embarrassed
by this, Hannah.

332
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,417
Never.

333
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:10,500
I was born blind.

334
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,667
I've always been this way.

335
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,500
May I see it,
your visor?

336
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,583
Yeah, sure.

337
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,625
So...

338
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,542
I guess if I'd been
conceived on your world,

339
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,375
I wouldn't even
be here now, would I?

340
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,250
No.

341
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,959
No, I'd have been terminated
as a fertilized cell.

342
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:36,333
It was the wish of our founders
that no one have to suffer

343
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,250
a life with disabilities.

344
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,583
Who gave them
the right to decide

345
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,667
whether or not
I should be here?

346
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,875
Whether or not I might have
something to contribute?

347
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,583
I don't know what to say.

348
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,041
Here you go.

349
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,417
How does it work?

350
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:02,959
Well...

351
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:05,542
the visor scans
the electromagnetic spectrum

352
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,291
from one hertz
to 100,000 terahertz,

353
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,125
converts it all to
usable frequencies

354
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,792
and then transmits
that information directly
to my brain.

355
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,834
What about
the data conversion rate?

356
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:17,875
How do you avoid
a sensory overload?

357
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:21,417
A bank of preprocessors
compresses the data stream
into pulses.

358
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,709
You see, that way,
my visual cortex never...

359
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:27,375
Wait a minute.

360
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:31,417
Wait just a minute.

361
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:32,917
We should be able to send

362
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:35,166
a high-energy pulse
through the tractor system.

363
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,041
If it's short enough, it
shouldn't overload the emitters.

364
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,250
The technology
is right here.

365
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,500
If we could adapt those
pulse compression routines

366
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,625
and then apply them
to the warp power conduits...

367
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,125
We'd have to avoid
tractor force rebounding,

368
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,375
but that shouldn't
be hard.

369
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,500
Sure, with a few
modifications...

370
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:58,125
Oh, that's perfect.

371
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,542
What?

372
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,750
If the answer to all of this

373
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,041
is in a visor
created for a blind man

374
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,083
who never would have
existed in your society.

375
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,417
No offense intended.

376
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:15,709
(<i> playing a Chopin prelude</i> )

377
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:55,667
(<i> rumbling</i> )

378
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,959
Please, Matthew, continue.

379
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:07,709
(<i> music resumes</i> )

380
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:40,667
It's hard to believe.

381
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,917
So much loveliness here

382
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:46,458
just a few meters away
from such desolation.

383
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:50,125
It's hard to believe
we're about to lose it.

384
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,875
This may sound
incredibly simplistic,

385
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,750
but can't you
re-engineer

386
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,625
all this on
another planet?

387
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,125
A nursery rhyme my mother
used to read to me

388
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,000
has been running round and round
my mind since all this began.

389
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,500
A nursery rhyme?

390
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,792
"Humpty Dumpty
sat on a wall.

391
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:12,208
"Humpty Dumpty
had a great fall.

392
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,583
BOTH:
"All the king's horses
and all the king's men

393
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,625
couldn't put Humpty
together again."

394
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,625
Why do we tell our children
such ghastly stories?

395
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,709
Perhaps to prepare them
for times like these.

396
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,667
We are every bit
as fragile as an egg,

397
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,333
and as impossible
to reconstruct.

398
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,375
We are integrated
and refined to such a degree

399
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:39,375
that any fundamental change
would lead to chaos.

400
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,750
I'm so sorry, Aaron.

401
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,917
I wish I could
do something to help.

402
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:47,834
You have helped.

403
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:50,750
You've been wonderful
these past few days.

404
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,750
You've been
my counselor.

405
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,834
No...

406
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:59,959
A counselor has to maintain
a discreet distance.

407
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:02,792
I'd rather think of us
as friends.

408
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:04,625
Friends?

409
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,333
That just won't do
either...

410
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,500
will it?

411
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,041
Aaron...

412
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,333
I must confess,
part of me knows

413
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,834
that if I transport
through these walls,

414
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:24,375
you'll be on
the other side.

415
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,875
This is wrong.

416
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,500
Terribly wrong.

417
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,750
In order to move the core
fragment to a safe trajectory,

418
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,083
we needed our tractor beam
to be able to handle
high-powered pulses.

419
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,250
And we needed a more efficient
emitter to do that.

420
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,000
About four times
more efficient.

421
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,625
But we couldn't get
anywhere near that

422
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,792
without overloading
the emitter arrays.

423
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,208
So we added a little visor
technology to the process

424
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,417
and were able to boost
the effective force,

425
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:02,875
and at the same time,

426
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,542
lower the power conduit
stress levels.

427
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,875
What's the increase
in efficiency?

428
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,333
Up to almost 300%.

429
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,375
That's not enough.
HANNAH: That's true.

430
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:18,500
We won't be able to move
the fragment as far as
we'd like to, but...

431
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,834
But...
if we also fortify

432
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,041
the biosphere's structural
integrity at the same time...

433
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,834
With some of the shield
improvements that I've
discovered here, it could work.

434
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,917
Of course, we'll have
to lend them some of our
engineering support crews.

435
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:34,500
Advise Mr. Conor. Number One,
brief the appropriate officers.

436
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,166
Prepare them for transport
as soon as Mr. Conor approves.
Yes, sir.

437
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,333
You're up early.

438
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:51,959
I'm still on
<i>Enterprise</i> time.

439
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:57,041
Aaron...

440
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,208
I'm going back
to the ship.

441
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,166
I'm not going to
see you again.

442
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,542
Why?

443
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:08,083
Because it's
the right thing to do.

444
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,750
I'm not convinced of that.

445
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,375
You know it as well as I do.

446
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,208
You're angry.

447
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,250
Yes, I'm angry.

448
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,834
I'm angry with myself
for allowing this to happen.

449
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,542
Deanna...

450
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,959
I could fall in love
with you so easily...

451
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:36,166
but we both know the end
of that story, don't we?

452
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,458
How would Martin feel

453
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,792
about introducing
half-Betazoid DNA

454
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:42,834
into the genetic balance?

455
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,500
If we have to evacuate,
anything's possible.

456
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,792
Listen to yourself.

457
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:55,458
A few days ago,
you wouldn't even talk to us.

458
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,041
This is my fault.

459
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,750
I'm so sorry.

460
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,792
I need you here.

461
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,458
This doesn't
have to happen again.

462
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,333
I have to go.

463
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:21,917
Good news, Aaron.

464
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:24,542
We should be able to change
the course of the core fragment,

465
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:26,750
but we'll also need
to fortify the structure.

466
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,959
And we're going to
need help to do it.

467
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:31,583
We'll need to bring
down engineering crews
from the<i> Enterprise</i>

468
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,709
to work with your people
for the next 48 hours.

469
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:36,166
Engineering crews?

470
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,208
They have to install
five new shield generators

471
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:39,709
and power supplies.

472
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,625
50 officers are waiting
for your approval

473
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,375
to transport down.

474
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:52,667
We don't have
much time, Aaron.

475
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,792
Is there any other choice?

476
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:56,542
None.

477
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:03,667

transport when ready.

484
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:48,875
Aye, sir.

485
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,792
You may proceed,
Mr. La Forge.

486
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:54,166
Yes, sir.

Good luck.
You, too.

488
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:02,333
Engage tractor beam.

489
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,959
Okay, let's give it a try.

490
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:13,625
Shutting down
non-critical systems.

491
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,667
Emitter circuits
170% over standard.

492
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,750
Increasing impulse power
to tractor emitters.

493
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,083
E.P.S. power levels rising.

494
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,583
Transferring warp power
to tractor beam generator.

495
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:30,542
Graviton generator's
operating normally.

496
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:33,458
Surge pulse
now synchronized.

497
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:37,542
Emitters radiating
at 320% over standard.

498
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,458
Bridge, we need more power.

499
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,458
Reduce life-support to minimum
requirements, Mr. Data.

500
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:44,166
Aye, sir.

501
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,375
390% over standard.

502
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,500
Come on, come on.

503
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,000
No change in
the fragment's course.

504
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
We've got to increase
the pulse frequency.

505
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,542
The emitter circuits
won't hold for long.

506
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:01,667
We don't<i> need</i> them
for long.

507
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,959
400% over standard.

508
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:11,000
Okay.
Now we're getting there.

509
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,583
Fragment's moved .4 degrees
off its previous heading... .65.

510
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,208
It's working.

511
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,792
We have lost one of
the emitter circuits, sir.

512
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:25,041
Life-support failure...
decks nine, twelve and thirteen.

513
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:27,041
Engage evacuation procedures
for those decks.

514
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:30,000
Geordi, we are going to need
power back soon.
LA FORGE: Acknowledged.

515

heading adjustment

516
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:34,959
is at 1.01 degrees.

517
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:37,625
Is it enough?
Not yet. Hold on.

518
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,750
We've lost the second lateral
emitter circuit.

519
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,917
Losing life-support systems
on decks five through nine.

00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:47,625
Mr. La Forge?
LA FORGE: Hold on, Captain.

00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,709
Ship-wide life-support failure
in 15 seconds, sir.

523
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:53,083

00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,458
1.18!

527
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,917
Now, Mr. La Forge.

528
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:04,709
Yes, sir. Shutting down
all tractor emissions.

529
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,250
Transferring power
back to life-support.

530
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,125
One point... two!

531
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,750
We've got it!

532
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:20,792
Life-support normal
on all decks.

533
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,083
Mr. Data?

534
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,834
The fragment's course
has been altered

535
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:26,500
by 1.21 degrees, sir.

536
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,083
Hail the colony.

537
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,667
Yes, Captain?
PICARD: Success, Mr. Conor.

538
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,709
With the upgrades
to your biosphere,

539
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:37,959
the core fragment should
no longer be a danger.

540
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:42,041
I cannot adequately express
my appreciation to your crew.

541
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,667
Is Hannah able to hear me?

542
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:46,417
Yes, yes.
Go ahead, Aaron.

543
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,875
CONOR: This is an historic
achievement, Hannah.

544
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:51,250
You've done a wonderful thing
for our people.

545
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,041
Thank you.

546
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,375
We look forward to honoring you
appropriately when you return.

547
00:29:56,375 --> 00:30:00,083
Thank you again, Captain.
Conor out.

548
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,458
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental:</i>

549
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,333
<i>the stellar core fragment</i>
<i>has passed safely</i>

550
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:18,792
<i>out of the Moab system.</i>

551
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:21,291
<i>The colony was shaken</i>
<i>by powerful tremblers,</i>

552
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:23,125
<i>but fortunately</i>
<i>there were no injuries</i>

553
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,583
<i>and only minor damage</i>
<i>was reported.</i>

554
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,125
Energize.

555
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,083
That should do it.

556
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,333
All members of
the<i> Enterprise</i> crew

557
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,917
are accounted for,
Mr. Conor.

558
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:43,083
They've been invaluable,
Commander, thank you again.

559
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,458
If there's nothing else,
we can be on our way.

560
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:49,166
Would you tell Deanna Troi
for me that I'm sorry

561
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:53,083
I didn't get the opportunity
to say good-bye personally?

562
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:56,125
I'm sure she'll feel
the same way.

563
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,750
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )
A breach in the biosphere.

564
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,834
Get Hannah Bates.

565
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:10,417
Apparently the refortification
wasn't adequate.

566
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:12,875
There's definite
structural damage.

567
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:15,625
It appears that the tectonic
shifts created a breach.

568
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,000
Can it be repaired?
I don't know.

569
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,458
I'll have to run
a diagnostic in the lab.

570
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:23,542
Unless we seal it and fast,
we may have to evacuate.

571
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:26,500
How long do we have?
Uh, based on the level of
toxicity I'm reading,

572
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,375
it may only be
a matter of hours.

573
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,625
You mind if I give her
a hand, Commander?
By all means.

574
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:42,875
Isn't it amazing,
after all we went through?

575
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah.

576
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,959
Amazing.

577
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:48,291
It looks bad.

578
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,750
It's cracked
well beneath the surface.

579
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,375
Why are you doing this?

580
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,875
What do you mean?

581
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,625
There's no breach.

582
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,500
What are you talking about?

583
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,625
Look at it.
It's right here.

584
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:03,291
I measured the toxic leak.
You saw me.

585
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:06,875
Hannah, my visor's
positronic scan

586
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:09,041
would have detected
the leak

587
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,959
and its molecular
pattern enhancer

588
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:14,250
would have picked up
even the smallest crack.

589
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:22,166
The damn thing doesn't
miss much, does it?

590
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:23,542
Fine.

591
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,667
I'll tell them the truth.

592
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,709
Will that make you happy?

593
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:31,834
Why are you doing this?

594
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:38,542
I was born to be one of
the best scientific minds

595
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,542
of my generation.

596
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,500
And in the past five days,

597
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,458
I have encountered technology
that I had barely imagined.

598
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:50,083
And I've got to ask myself,
if we're so brilliant,

599
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:53,000
how come we didn't invent
any of these things?

600
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:58,667
Well, maybe necessity really
is the mother of invention.

601
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:02,333
You never really look
for something until you need it.

602
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:05,625
But all my needs have been
anticipated and planned for

603
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,458
before I was even born.

604
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:11,875
All of us in this colony have
been living in the Dark Ages.

605
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:15,083
It's like we're victims
of a 200-year-old joke.

606
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,625
Until you came,

607
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:20,250
all we could see was to
the wall of our biosphere.

608
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,375
Suddenly our eyes
have been opened

609
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,667
to the infinite
possibilities.

610
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,458
Asylum?

611
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:27,875
She wants to leave
the colony.

612
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,083
She may not be
the only one.

613
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:32,250
The science teams that
went down to the surface

614
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,333
fielded a lot of questions
from the colonists

615
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:37,458
who were more than curious about
what's outside their world.

616
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,625
Well, why shouldn't we
grant them asylum?

617
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,875
We can't do that.

618
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,458
We have to do that.

619
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,667
Do you understand what
it would do to the colony?

620
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,625
I understand that
these are human beings,

621
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,333
Counselor,
with free will.

622
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,583
If she wants to leave,
she has every right to.

623
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,583
And what happens to the colony
if she does and others join her?

624
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:56,208
The society is
genetically integrated.

625
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:59,166
Suddenly there would be
gaps, missing pieces.

626
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:01,208
It would destroy them.

627
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:04,375
There must be something
we can do to help.

628
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,625
We may have done too much
to help them already, Doctor.

629
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,458
Well, we saved them
from destruction.

630
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:11,542
PICARD:
Did we?

631
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:16,875
Counselor, I think it's time
you took me to meet Mr. Conor.

632
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,667
Transporter room three.

633
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,166
Computer, halt.

634
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:35,125
Captain, I have
to tell you something,

635
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,709
and it isn't easy for me

636
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:40,458
because I've used
very poor judgement.

637
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:42,667
Actually, I've acted
quite unprofessionally.

638
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:46,000
Counselor,
what is it you say?

639
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,834
Take a deep breath.

640
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:53,834
Conor and I have had
a relationship.

641
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:58,375
I see.

642
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:01,166
It should never have happened.

643
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,333
I knew there was
concern about

644
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:06,125
outside influences, and...

645
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,917
I should have been
more careful.

646
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:15,583
What is your status
with him now?

647
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:18,875
I did not intend
to see him again.

648
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:22,000
Would you prefer not
to return to the surface?

649
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,125
No, I think I should
come with you,

650
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,500
but I wanted you to know
before we went down.

651
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:31,834
I appreciate that.

652
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:33,917
Computer, resume.

653
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,166
I wanted so much
to help him...

654
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:45,166
to be there for him, but...

655
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:46,709
the more I was...

656
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:49,208
Deanna.

657
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:52,166
We all went into this
with the best of intentions.

658
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,208
I should have walked away

659
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:56,000
as soon as I saw
what was happening.

660
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,750
But you didn't...

661
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:00,709
and that's human.

662
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:02,792
We make mistakes.

663
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:07,208
Genetic manipulation or not,

664
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,333
nobody's perfect.

665
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:19,625
You would ignore
the welfare of the colony

666
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,709
for your own
selfish interests?

667
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,792
The welfare of this colony
would be best served

668
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:26,417
by rejoining the human race.

669
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,291
She has been contaminated
by the people on that ship.

670
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:33,000
Aaron.

671
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,709
Mr. Conor, I believe that
you and I should talk.

672
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:38,417
This is<i> your</i> doing.

673
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:40,166
We never should have
answered your hails.

674
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,083
If we'd followed
that advice, Martin,

675
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,375
we'd all be dead by now.

676
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,166
So much for the welfare
of this colony.

677
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:46,834
You are not
taking her with you.

678
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:49,250
I'm leaving, and I'll
tell you something else,

679
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,792
there are at least
a dozen others who are
ready to go with me.

680
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,792
Hannah, let's allow Aaron and
Captain Picard to discuss this.

681
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:58,083
Why don't we
go for a walk?

682
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,375
There's nothing else
for them to talk about.

683
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:09,208
Martin.

684
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:12,041
I think it would be
helpful if I...

685
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,875
I want to talk
to Captain Picard alone.

686
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,041
But...
Thank you, Martin.

687
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,959
The irony is he's the one
who saw this coming

688
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:27,667
from the moment
you arrived.

689
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:29,917
Because I didn't want
to hear him,

690
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,750
I chose not to listen.

691
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,417
You made decisions you felt
would save your colony.

692
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:37,041
No.

693
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,500
No.

694
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,208
I wish it were that simple.

695
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:44,709
I'm afraid I can't
forgive myself so easily.

696
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:47,875
You see, Captain...

697
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:51,208
I know what Hannah Bates
is feeling.

698
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,792
I've been feeling it
as well.

699
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,083
I found your people
intriguing,

700
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:59,000
stimulating,
as she has.

701
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,083
I've been every bit as curious
about you as the next man,

702
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,667
but I am not
the next man.

703
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:07,750
I am the leader of
these people,

704
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,458
and every genetic fiber
in my being

705
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,834
demands that
I protect them.

706
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:14,208
And instead,
I have betrayed them.

707
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,542
I have allowed
this to happen.

708
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:19,208
We've both allowed
this to happen.

709
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:22,750
Then let us both find a way to
stop it from going any further.

710
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:26,709
I wish I could see a way.

711
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:31,083
Picard, I was born
to govern this colony,

712
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,041
not to dismantle it.

713
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:34,834
If you force them to stay,

714
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:37,041
you will be suppressing
their human rights.

715
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,959
If even a handful leave,

716
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:42,041
the damage to this society
will be devastating.

717
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,875
What about the rights of those
who would stay behind?

718
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,917
They are the ones will
inherit the social chaos

719
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:50,709
that will follow
for generations.

720
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:53,417
Your arrival
created this problem.

721
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,083
Your departure solves it.

722
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,875
That is simplistic.

723
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:59,375
Refuse them passage.

724
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:02,834
I cannot ignore
the requests of people--

725
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,333
humans--

726
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,959
who ask for transport
away from here.

727
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:09,959
Nor can you ignore the fact
that thousands will suffer

728
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:11,959
if you agree to take them.

729
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:14,959
And as suffering grows,
more will demand to leave.

730
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:18,542
We are witnessing
the end of this existence.

731
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:20,959
I implore you, Captain.

732
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,291
Do not let this happen.

733
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:26,125
You would have me
make the decision for you,

734
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,083
but I can't do that.

735
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:31,208
I am willing to talk
to these people with you.

736
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:34,667
And I will urge them not
to make an impulsive choice,

737
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,667
but if finally,

738
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,792
they choose to leave,

739
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:42,458
the<i> Enterprise</i> 
will not turn them away.

740
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,083
Captain Picard has decided
to grant transport

741
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:02,417
to any individuals who wish
to leave Genome colony.

742
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:05,959
I am asking you to stay.

743
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:08,667
Aaron, don't you see

744
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,750
we can't be happy here
any longer?

745
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,500
We were innocent.

746
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,041
It will never be
that way again.

747
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,500
The experiences
of the past week

748
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,125
will become
part of our heritage.

749
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,000
We will adjust.

750
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,959
In a few generations...

751
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:28,208
We're not willing to
stay here a few generations.

752
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:31,375
All right.

753
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:34,959
Then give me six months.

754
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:38,083
Just wait six months
before you leave.

755
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,875
What will that accomplish?

756
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:42,083
It's true that
our presence here

757
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:45,583
has had an unintended
influence on your society,

758
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:48,959
but it's done and there is
no way to undo it.

759
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:51,583
But feelings are
running very high.

760
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:54,083
Perhaps it's not
such a bad idea

761
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:56,333
that you should take
adequate time

762
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,375
to weigh carefully
the consequences

763
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,750
of what you're
about to do.

764
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,333
We are prepared to
return in six months.

765
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:06,834
In other words,
we are being asked to
stay here for six months

766
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:09,625
while they pressure us
to change our minds.

767
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:13,375
In five days, you've seen only
the most superficial evidence

768
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:16,041
of what life is like
outside this biosphere.

769
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:20,000
Would you ever choose to live
aboard a ship in a bottle,
Captain?

770
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,250
You are in command
of a starship.

771
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,500
You live to explore
the unknown.

772
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,542
We ask for that
same privilege.

773
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:28,417
Hannah...

774
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:30,667
this is your home.

775
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:33,750
We are all, in a sense,
your family.

776
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,291
Don't we deserve
an opportunity

777
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:39,750
to open a dialogue on
this issue at the very least?

778
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,792
I am only asking
for six months.

779
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:43,458
It won't make any difference.

780
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,458
You'll only be putting
the people of this colony

781
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:47,667
through unnecessary
pain and anguish.

782
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:50,208
<i>You</i> are the ones
causing pain and anguish

783
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,083
in this colony-- you!

784
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:53,917
Don't you see, Aaron,
it's over?!

785
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:57,041
It's time for you to lead
our people into a new era.

786
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:59,041
You could
come with us.

787
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,875
When you're ready
to come home...

788
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:07,083
you will be welcome.

789
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:18,083
What will you do now?

790
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:21,250
Attempt to assess
the damage--

791
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,709
spend the rest of my life
on the near impossible task

792
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,875
of rebuilding this society
without the proper pieces.

793
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:32,125
Aaron, you acted in the best
interests of your people.

794
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:34,500
There was no way to
avoid what happened.

795
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,375
I replay each step
in my mind

796
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:41,083
looking for the wrong turn,
a mistake in judgement.

797
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:43,667
I can find only one.

798
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,875
And as hard as I try,

799
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:49,291
I cannot regret
even that one.

800
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:53,208
In fact, I'm quite certain
that given the opportunity,

801
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:57,250
I would choose to make
the same mistake again.

802
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,000
I can only wonder why
with all the hundreds

803
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,875
of genetically compatible women,
I would fall in love with you.

804
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,792
Don't say that.

805
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:09,750
Perhaps it's your imperfections
which make you so unique.

806
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:15,583
But I<i> am</i> in love with you,
Deanna Troi...

807
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,792
and I will always be.

808
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,041
(<i> chiming</i> )

809
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:43,625
Come.

810
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,417
The colonists
are all on board, sir.

811
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,417
How many finally?
Twenty-three.

812
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:51,417
If ever
we needed reminding

813
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:54,208
of the importance of
the Prime Directive, it is now.

814
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,917
The Prime Directive
doesn't apply.

815
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:57,709
They're human.
Doesn't it?

816
00:43:57,709 --> 00:44:01,458
Our very presence
may have damaged,

817
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:04,166
even destroyed
their way of life.

818
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:06,667
Now, whether or not we agree
with that way of life--

819
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:10,417
whether they're human or not
is irrelevant, Number One.

820
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,709
We are responsible.

821
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:14,583
We had to respond
to the threat

822
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,875
of the core fragment,
didn't we?

823
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:18,417
Of course we did.

824
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:21,542
But in the end,

825
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:24,208
we may have proved just
as dangerous to that colony

826
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:27,959
as any core fragment
could ever have been.
