00:00:01,917 --> 00:00:05,875
<i>Doctor Beverly Crusher,</i>
<i>Personal Log, Stardate 44821.3:</i>

2
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:08,834
<i>Began an analysis today</i>
<i>of the respiratory problems</i>

3
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:11,917
<i>being experienced on</i>
<i>the Beta Moon of Peliar Zel.</i>

4
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:14,959
<i>Finally got an actual letter</i>
<i>from Wesley.</i>

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:16,834
<i>Topped the class</i>
<i>in Exobiology,</i>

6
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:19,500
<i>but he's still struggling</i>
<i>in Ancient Philosophies.</i>

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
<i>And... there's someone new</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

8
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,250
Ambassador Odan, Dr. Crusher.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,166
I was just on my way
to speak to you.

10
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,709
Hello, Data.

11
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:40,875
I've completed my study
on the atmospheric variations

12
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:44,000
which have occurred
on the moons since the new
technology was implemented.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,959
Oh, thank you, Commander,
that will be most helpful

14
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,583
in my efforts to mediate
the quarrel.

15
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,291
I could go over it
with you now.

16
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,041
It would not require
more than two hours.

17
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,583
Oh, we-we do
appreciate that, Data,

18
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:57,000
but the Ambassador and I
have set aside this time

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,542
to analyze the incidence
of the lung disease

20
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:02,333
on the moons' inhabitants.

21
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,667
Then it is perfect timing,
Doctor.

22
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:08,000
What better occasion
to integrate my results
into your study?

23
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,709
Now that I think about it,

24
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,667
you're absolutely right,
Commander.

25
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,709
Unfortunately,
I'm not feeling very well.

26
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:20,417
Perhaps Dr. Crusher
could get you started

27
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:22,375
inputting your information.

28
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,417
I, myself, must return
to my quarters.

29
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,291
Ambassador, are you still
having those awful headaches?

30
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:30,125
I'd better bring you
a hypospray to take care of it.

31
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:33,083
I would be most grateful.
Okay.

32
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:38,333
Put a cold cloth on
your forehead, Ambassador.

33
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,792
I'll do my best to
be with you shortly.

34
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:43,625
I'll set you up with
the medical monitor, Data.

35
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,083
It'll take you a while to
input the figures, won't it?

36
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,333
At least an hour.

37
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,083
But I do not believe
much time can be saved

38
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,792
by exhibiting such
haste now, Doctor.

39
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:54,417
Data, there are times when
every second does count.

40
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,166
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

41
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:08,208
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

42
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,041
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

43
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:14,041
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

44
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:18,500
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

45
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,291
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

46
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,000
(<i> chuckling</i> )

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,333
Somehow, I had
an unnatural fear

48
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:44,166
that Data was going to barge in
and ask to discuss

49
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:48,250
the peripheral effects
of magnetospheric energy taps.

50
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,875
Well, if I don't get back
soon and take a look at
his projections,

51
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,291
he just might come
looking for me.

52
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,208
Do you know
when I first met

53
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,250
the formidable
Doctor Beverly--

54
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,917
what, uh, 10 days ago?

55
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:03,709
I thought to myself,

56
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:07,041
"This woman is ice...

57
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:11,041
through to her bones."

58
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,375
Who would have ever guessed
that instead of ice

59
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,542
there is fire?

60
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,875
Odan...

61
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,750
Stay here.

62
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,333
Don't go.

63
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,041
Odan, are we...

64
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,625
Is this interfering

65
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:36,458
with your work on
the Peliar Zel problems?

66
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,000
Well, fortunately,

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I've done about as much
as I can until we get there,

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,250
because I just can't seem
to keep my mind

69
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,291
on my work right now.

70
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,000
Odan...
Mm-hmm.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,625
I have to go.
No!

72
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,792
Promise me we'll be
together tonight.

73
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:56,500
I promise.

74
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,041
Then you may go,
Doctor Beverly.

75
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,709
It's just Beverly.

76
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,375
Not just Beverly.

77
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,125
It's Beverly's smile,

78
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,542
it's her kindness,

79
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,458
her beauty,
within and without.

80
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,458
So much more
than<i> just</i> Beverly.

81
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,959
PICARD:
Picard to Ambassador Odan.

82
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,959
ODAN:
Yes, Captain, this is Odan.

83
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,792
The Federation representative
from Peliar Zel has come on
board.

84
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,750
Would you care to meet us
in the observation lounge?

85
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,834
I'll be right there,
Captain.

86
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,834
If the news were encouraging,
I assume you would not be here.

87
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,917
I am afraid you are
correct, Captain.

88
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,166
The situation is growing
progressively worse.

89
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,583
(<i> whispering</i> )
Where have you been?

90
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,041
Uh, with a patient.
Minor emergency.

91
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,959
PICARD:
Ambassador Odan.

92
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:55,583
This is Governor Leka Trion
of Peliar Zel.

93
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,500
Ambassador,
thank you for coming.

94
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,959
I knew your father.

95
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,875
His efforts helped keep
our people at peace

96
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,458
for several generations.

97
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,417
I would hope to serve you
as well as he.

98
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:08,542
Governor,
Ambassador.

99
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,417
I hope Doctor Crusher was able
to help you with your headache.

100
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:18,333
Thank you.
Actually, she was.

101
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,583
Governor Leka has intercepted us
before we reach her planet

102
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,208
in order to update us
on the situation.

103
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,333
The people on our moons
have been in discord

104
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,208
ever since they migrated
from our planet

105
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,917
five centuries ago.

106
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:32,125
To us on the planet, they're
like two squabbling children.

107
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,208
We try to help them settle their
arguments by not taking sides,

108
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,166
but this time,
we are at a loss.

109
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,792
Well, I've been studying
the information you sent.

110
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:43,375
If I understand correctly,
the people of Alpha Moon

111
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,709
have found a way to tap
directly into the magnetic field

112
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:49,458
of your planet and now rely
exclusively on that
energy source.

113
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,250
Yes, but the Beta Moon
is now suffering

114
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,750
some environmental damage
as a result.

115
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,875
My design model suggests

116
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,625
that Beta will
eventually experience

117
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,458
rising temperatures,
erratic tide surges

118
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,750
and, in general,
the beginning of global warming.

119
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,750
The impact on the health
of the Betan people is clear.

120
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,291
There will be profound medical
repercussions.

121
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:15,542
Alpha is unwilling to give up
its newfound energy source.

122
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:19,291
Beta accuses them of
intentionally courting genocide.

123
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,583
Our efforts to reach
a compromise have failed.

124
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,458
And now we have
received intelligence

125
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,291
that both sides
are arming for war.

126
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,750
If that happens,
the people on my planet

127
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,333
will begin to take sides and the
outcome can only be disastrous.

128
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,834
We'll be in orbit around
Peliar Zel within six hours.

129
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:38,625
If you could arrange
for the representatives

130
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,500
of Alpha and Beta to be there,

131
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,709
then Ambassador Odan
could beam directly down

132
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,000
to the planet's surface.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,166
Excuse me, Captain.

134
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,875
I prefer to shuttle
to the surface.

135
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,750
I would not recommend it.

136
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,250
There are many radical factions
involved in this dispute.

137
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,917
It would be difficult
to guarantee your safety.

138
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,208
Well, I'm sure I'm not the first
who has expressed discomfort

139
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,208
at the idea
of molecular transport.

140
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,709
Thank you, but I prefer
to remain intact.

141
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,458
I'll shuttle down.
As you wish.

142
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:15,500
Counselor, what is it?

143
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,625
It's Ambassador Odan.

144
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,375
I continually feel...

145
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,417
fluctuations of
emotion from him.

146
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:25,959
Perhaps it's perfectly
normal among the Trill.

147
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,500
It could be.

148
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,458
We know so very little
about them.

149
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,875
Yes... quite.

150
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,500
WOMAN: Hi, Deanna.
Hi.

151
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:56,625
Is that the colgonite
astringent

152
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,750
you have on your eyes?

153
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,917
Yes. I guess so.

154
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,250
I've never tried it.

155
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,625
Someone...

156
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,959
just put it on... me.

157
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:15,000
I didn't know
you even came in here.

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,625
I don't.

159
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:20,291
At least, um...
at least not very often.

160
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:24,000
But it feels good
to indulge yourself sometimes.

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,542
I guess so.

162
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,709
Especially when you haven't
done so in a while.

163
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,792
Wha-What is that
supposed to mean?

164
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:36,166
Beverly...
you're in love.

165
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,417
(<i> sighs</i> )

166
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:42,750
Sometimes I wish
you weren't so empathic.

167
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,959
(<i> whispering</i> )
I don't think it's
really a secret.

168
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,583
It isn't?

169
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,917
You've been glowing.

170
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,917
Oh.

171
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,166
Must be the astringent.

172
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,792
What?

173
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,542
Nothing.

174
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,834
Oh, yes, there is.
What is it?

175
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,917
(<i> sighs</i> )

176
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:15,291
It's just something
I sense in Odan.

177
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,333
What?
What do you sense?

178
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,041
It's just...

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,041
How well do you
really know him?

180
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,458
I feel I know him better

181
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,667
than I've known anyone
in my life.

182
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,542
Am I being foolish?
I don't think so.

183
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:36,542
And yet, I've only known him
for a couple of weeks.

184
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:39,875
Of course,
that could be infatuation.

185
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,917
But I am a grownup
and I know the difference

186
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:44,667
between love and infatuation.

187
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, all I know is...

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,667
I haven't felt this way
for a long time.

189
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,542
And you like it.

190
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:58,250
I like it.

191
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,458
(<i> door chimes</i> )

192
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,959
Come.

193
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,583
You wanted to see me,
Captain?

194
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,792
Yes, Ambassador.
Please sit down.

195
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:16,083
We have entered orbit.

196
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,417
We shall be transporting
you to the planet

197
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:19,917
in a few minutes.

198
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,458
Oh, I am ready, Captain.

199
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,875
How will you proceed
when you're there?

200
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,375
Oh, I cannot answer that.

201
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,375
I... I never know until
I'm into the situation--

202
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,959
meet the people involved.

203
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,834
I work very much by instinct
and not by prearranged plan.

204
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:37,667
Well, it seems to
work well for you.

205
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,875
Well, I do like to go
into a situation

206
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,625
as well-informed
as possible.

207
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:45,208
And I must say that your staff
has been quite helpful

208
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,291
in briefing me
on the problems down there--

209
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,250
particularly Doctor Crusher.

210
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,375
My staff is quite capable.
I'm glad they've been useful.

211
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,750
Your Doctor Beverly is...

212
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,250
an extraordinary person,

213
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,375
both as a scientist and...

214
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,709
and as a woman.

215
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes, I'm sure that's true.

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,583
Well, shall we make our way
to the Shuttle Bay?

217
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,083
Captain, you know
her better than I.

218
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,000
Do you have any idea

219
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,583
how committed she is to
remaining with Starfleet?

220
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,125
I wouldn't presume
to speak for her.

221
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,250
Oh, no, of course not.
I just thought...

222
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,375
Well, you've known her
so much longer than I.

223
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,625
TAGGERT: Ensign Taggert
to Captain Picard.
Yes, Ensign?

224
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,417
TAGGERT: The shuttle is ready
to transport the Ambassador.

225
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,333
Very well.

226
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,375
I'll find
my own way, Captain.

227
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,500
I hope to return
with good news.

228
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,458
Commander Riker has asked to
pilot you himself, Ambassador.

229
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,542
I am honored.

230
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,208
I don't know
when I'll be back.

231
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,041
I know.
Have a safe trip.

232
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,959
Oh, I will stay safe,
Doctor Beverly.

233
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,792
I have good
reason to return.

234
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:08,458
I've researched
Earth customs.

235
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,375
This flower is given
to express love.

236
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,500
Yes, it is.

237
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,375
Initiate shuttle
preflight sequence.

238
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,875
RIKER: Preflight underway,
counting to clearance.

239
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,458
Shuttle has cleared
the bay door.

240
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,959
Commander Riker, you will be out
of shield range in five seconds.

241
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,625
Acknowledged, Lieutenant.

242
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,542
We'll be entering the upper
ionosphere in 2:20 seconds.

243
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:45,667
Sir, an unidentified ship

244
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,500
is emerging from the limb
of the moon.

245
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,041
Hail the vessel.

246
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,000
RIKER: I have visual contact.
I don't recognize it.

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,166
It claims to be an escort vessel
from the Beta Moon.

248
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,125
There was no mention
of an escort.

249
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,542
Request a security
clearance code.

250
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:04,125
They do not answer, sir.

251
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,000
Commander Riker, prepare to
return to the Shuttle Bay.

252
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
RIKER:
Acknowledged.

253
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,917
Captain, they are loading
their phaser banks.

254
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,875
Increasing power
to the shields.

255
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,375
Coming about.

256
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:26,125
Engage tractor beam.
Report, Number One.

257
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,959
We've lost port thrusters
and both backup stabilizers.

258
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,667
I'm losing control.

259
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,834
PICARD:
We're bringing you in.

260
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,834
Captain, the shuttle hull
has been weakened.

261
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,792
We're breaking up.
You can't tow us.

262
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,375
You better beam us
directly on board.

263
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,333
No. Don't do it.
I can't stabilize the shuttle.

264
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:49,041
If you transport me,
it will kill me. Please...

265
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,166
PICARD: Number One,
we're ready to beam you aboard.

266
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,625
Belay that order, Captain.
I'll bring her in manually.

267
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:58,083
Advise Doctor Crusher
we have a medical emergency.

268
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,208
CRUSHER: He's in shock,
He's lost a lot of blood,

269
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,834
but that still doesn't
explain these readings.

270
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:11,875
Eosinophilia in the
cerebrospinal fluid at 46%.

271
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,792
Sedimentation rate is 29,

272
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:20,959
but his lymphocytes
are still intact.

273
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,291
It's as though there's
a parasite at work.

274
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,875
Odan?

275
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,709
Odan...

276
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,458
I need to do
exploratory surgery.

277
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,250
You may have
a parasitic infection.

278
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
You must not.

279
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,917
You won't survive.

280
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:47,375
What is that?

281
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,333
Beverly...

282
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,417
<i>that</i> is me.

283
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:54,291
What?

284
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,250
This body is just a host.

285
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:02,333
I am that parasite.

286
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,083
<i>That</i> is what
must survive.

287
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,458
It has always been
this way.

288
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,458
The Trill
are a joined species...

289
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,625
a host and a symbiont...

290
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,375
and in this fashion,
we have survived for millennia.

291
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,458
You're dying.

292
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,291
What can I do?

293
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,166
The host body is dying.

294
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,375
You must contact
the Trill quickly.

295
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,208
Tell them I need another host.

296
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,375
They will send
a replacement.

297
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,959
I know this is
difficult to accept...

298
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,417
but I beg you,
Doctor Beverly...

299
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,625
help me.

300
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,583
This mission
must be completed.

301
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:10,000
Odan's host body
died of the injuries

302
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,208
just over an hour ago,

303
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:16,375
but the symbiont being,
Odan, is still alive.

304
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,208
Odan is the one who
negotiated the last treaty.

305
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,875
But the man everyone
thought was his father

306
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,500
was just another
host body.

307
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,959
And the reason Odan
refused the transporter?

308
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:28,583
It would have damaged
the symbiont.

309
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,250
We've contacted
the Trill.

310
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,667
Another host will be here
in 40 hours.

311
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,458
I've placed
Odan in stasis.

312
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,041
He can survive another
hour, maybe two,

313
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,875
but not beyond that.

314
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:41,417
Would it be possible for me
to serve as a temporary carrier?

315
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:42,834
No, Data.

316
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:45,542
The relationship requires
a biological being.

317
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,542
We're at a desperate impasse
in the Peliar system.

318
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:51,458
The attack on the shuttlecraft
has inflamed the dispute.

319
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,792
Who was responsible?
No one will
admit anything.

320
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:57,000
Each side accuses the other
and the threats are mounting.

321
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,542
We need Odan.

322
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:01,750
Doctor, could
a human host carry him?

323
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,458
I believe so.

324
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,375
From Odan's description
of the process,

325
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,375
it should be possible,
but I don't have...

326
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:11,333
Then I volunteer.
There's been no precedent
for a human host.

327
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,667
I couldn't guarantee
what might happen.

328
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,083
The risk is too great,
Commander.

329
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,583
Weigh it against
the prospect of war.

330
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,208
It's your choice, Will.

331
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,083
Let's get to it.

332
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:36,583
I've given you
a local anesthetic.

333
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,125
You must be conscious
during the implantation.

334
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,333
Drugs might damage
the symbiont.

335
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,834
I understand.

336
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:45,709
Laser scalpel.

337
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:47,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

338
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,750
(<i> scalpel humming</i> )

339
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,000
How do you feel?

340
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,625
Is there any pain?

341
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,041
No, just some
strange sensations.

342
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,792
Vital signs?
Heart rate 110.

343
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,041
Blood pressure 90 over 40.

344
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,250
I can't close yet.
The assimilation's not complete.

345
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,750
OGAWA: Pulse 130 and climbing.
EEG is erratic.

346
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,125
He's going to start
fibrillating.

347
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,667
200 milligrams
of metrazene.

348
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,375
WOMAN:
Yes, Doctor.

349
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,125
Hang on, Will.

350
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,875
We've got
incorporation, Doctor.

351
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,542
I'm closing.

352
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,125
OGAWA:
Brain waves are
still irregular.

353
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,250
The metrazene should
have stabilized him.

354
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,208
I'll give it ten more seconds
before I go in again.

355
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,834
Here we go.
EEG approaching regular.

356
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:17,250
Blood pressure leveling off.

357
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,000
That's better.
Signs are returning to normal.

358
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,792
Will...

359
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,542
it's Beverly.

360
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,500
Can you hear me?

361
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,959
Hello.

362
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,875
You're going to be all right.

363
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,166
How do you feel?

364
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,083
I'm fine.

365
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,667
You look a little tired,
Doctor Beverly.

366
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,750
I know this must be
disturbing, Governor,

367
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,709
but you must convince
the inhabitants of the moons

368
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,458
that I am Odan.

369
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:05,583
I have his skills,
his thoughts, his memories.

370
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:10,125
They will perceive you
as a Starfleet officer--

371
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,208
perhaps with
your own agenda.

372
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,250
The man they knew
as my father...

373
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,083
the man who stands
before them...

374
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,750
both are merely hosts.

375
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,667
It is your task to
help them understand.

376
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,291
I will try.

377
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,000
I cannot promise
they will listen.

378
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,792
They are more factionalized
than ever.

379
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:35,375
Listening is a skill
which seems to have evaporated

380
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,208
with the heat of argument.

381
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,208
Speak softly, Governor.

382
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,375
Those who cannot
hear an angry shout

383
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,166
may strain
to hear a whisper.

384
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,417
I will do what I can.

385
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,834
Well done.

386
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,709
Mr. Worf, will you escort
the Ambassador to his quarters?

387
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,458
I'm just
a little dizzy.

388
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,625
I'll be fine.
I just need to lie down.

389
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,250
Picard to Doctor Crusher.
CRUSHER: Yes, Captain?

390
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,125
Doctor,
the Ambassador is not well.

391
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:09,208
Will you please attend to him
in his quarters?
Right away, sir.

392
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,542
White cell count
is elevated.

393
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:15,917
Six-tenths of
a degree temperature.

394
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:18,125
But no sign of rejection.

395
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,583
That's good.

396
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,667
You look awfully pale.

397
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:24,875
Just a little weak
and lightheaded.

398
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,709
Cerebral blood flow
looks normal.

399
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,875
I'll leave
a metabolic booster.

400
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,083
Use it if the symptoms
get worse.
Beverly...

401
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,417
Beyond that,
I don't know what to do.

402
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,166
This is all new to me.

403
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,583
It is new to me,
as well.

404
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,917
Please don't go.

405
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:43,375
We've got to talk
about this.

406
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,458
I don't know what to say.
Nor do I.

407
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:48,125
But I know that
the silence would injure us.

408
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,625
Well, maybe you should have
thought about that sooner.

409
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,083
Maybe you should have
told me what you were.

410
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,625
It didn't seem to bother you
to remain silent yesterday.

411
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,166
It never occurred to me.

412
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,000
This is what I am.

413
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,041
Did you ever tell me that
you were only a single being?

414
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,125
Of course not.
It was normal to you.

415
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,625
I don't know who you are!

416
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,041
You must understand.

417
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:13,917
Whoever I... whoever I seem to
be, I am Odan,

418
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:15,917
who loved you.

419
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,667
That has not changed.

420
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,375
I still love you.

421
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,208
I can't help that!

422
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:24,417
If this causes you pain,
I will suppress it.

423
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:26,458
I will keep
my distance.

424
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:29,291
Doctor Beverly...

425
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,166
I would never hurt you.

426
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:44,750
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

427
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,792
May I join you?

428
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:02,375
You know, Deanna,
the first man

429
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,375
I ever loved unconditionally
was named Stefan.

430
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,333
He was a soccer player,
and I would watch him

431
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,542
as he would race
down the field.

432
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,542
And I thought my heart
would stop

433
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:15,000
because he was
so beautiful.

434
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,792
We married
and had three children--

435
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:20,959
twin boys,
Andrew and Alexander,

436
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:24,792
and then later,
a little girl, Jennifer.

437
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:28,291
Stefan became an artist...
very famous.

438
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:31,208
He created huge,
breathtaking

439
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,250
metal sculptures.

440
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,583
He came to adore me
as much as I worshipped him--

441
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:38,834
in my daydreams at least.

442
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:41,041
Stefan was 11
and I was eight.

443
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,500
He never even
knew I existed.

444
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,417
Oh, Deanna...

445
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:47,542
I loved Odan.

446
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm sure of it.

447
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,875
I had no doubts, no fears.

448
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:54,500
But what was it I loved?

449
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,291
His eyes?

450
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,709
His hands?
His mouth?

451
00:25:58,709 --> 00:25:59,875
They're gone.

452
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,542
If that was all it was,

453
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:05,208
I should mourn him
and go on.

454
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:07,250
But it was more than that.

455
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,709
I felt...

456
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:12,333
completely free with him...

457
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,000
unguarded...

458
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,834
at ease with myself.

459
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:20,375
There were so many things
that made him special to me.

460
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:22,208
And where are they?

461
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,792
Are they still here,

462
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,333
alive in Will Riker?

463
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,667
I look at Will,

464
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,500
and I see...

465
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,834
someone I've known
for years...

466
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:37,834
a kind of brother.

467
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,333
But inside...

468
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:46,333
is he<i> really</i> Odan?

469
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh... help me.

470
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,083
Please.

471
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:02,917
What do your
feelings tell you?

472
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:05,667
I feel his pull.
It's very powerful.

473
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:09,250
I wish he'd never
come on this ship.

474
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,250
Don't wish that,
Beverly.

475
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,458
You can't be open to love

476
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,750
if you don't risk pain.

477
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,250
I don't care.

478
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,000
I'd give anything not to feel
the way I do now.

479
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,583
(<i> door opens</i> )

480
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,542
He's here, isn't he?

481
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:33,250
Look at him.

482
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,291
I don't want to look at him.
Talk to me.

483
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:37,166
Just keep talking to me.

484
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:43,875
The first man I ever
loved was my father.

485
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:46,625
He was strong and tall.

486
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:50,291
He carried me when
the ground was muddy.

487
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,166
He chased away
the monsters

488
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,375
that hid under
my bed at night.

489
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:58,709
And he sang to me
and kept me safe.

490
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:03,417
And he went away.

491
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,500
What I wouldn't give
to hear those songs again--

492
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,542
to feel his arms
protect me.

493
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:15,000
I never will.

494
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,959
But I can still feel
his warmth and his love

495
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:21,500
as though he were
here with me.

496
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,375
If you can feel
those things

497
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:29,250
from the man we know
as Will Riker,

498
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,291
accept them.

499
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:34,667
Accept the love.

500
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,000
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44823.8:</i>

501
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,750
<i>Representatives of</i>
<i>the two moons of Peliar Zel</i>

502
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,333
<i>have agreed to come on board</i>

00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:07,333
<i>to meet the "new"</i>
<i>Ambassador Odan.</i>

504
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:10,959
White cell count
is elevated.

505
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:14,375
It's getting higher and higher
every time I read it.

506
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,250
Are you in pain?

507
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,834
Not much.

508
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:20,125
Ambassador, we can stall
the representatives.

509
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,000
They would see that
as a deception.

510
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,542
I must meet with them.

511
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,542
But surely, to present
yourself in this condition

512
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:26,875
is not going to
help our cause.

513
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,166
I promise you, Captain,

514
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,333
they will never know
that I'm ill.

515
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:33,792
Captain,
the emissaries.

516
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:38,250
May I present Kalin Trose
of Alpha Moon

517
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,041
and Lathal Bine
of Beta Moon.

518
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:43,083
Thank you
for receiving us, Captain.

519
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,291
Is<i> this</i> Ambassador Odan?

520
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:50,875
Lathal Bine,

521
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:53,917
it was your aunt who
represented Beta 30 years ago.

522
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,375
That is correct.

523
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:57,041
She was
a formidable woman.

524
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:59,291
I had the utmost respect
for her.

525
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:03,959
And who was it who spoke
for Alpha so long ago?

526
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:06,125
RIKER/ODAN:
That was you, of course--

527
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,917
Kalin Trose.

528
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:09,625
Then you were a young man,

529
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:12,041
bristling with
passion and zeal,

530
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:13,834
yet wise enough to understand

531
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:17,250
that your people needed peace
to ensure their future.

532
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,542
And how did you
achieve a compromise

533
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:28,208
between that young man

534
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:30,709
and the iron-willed woman
of Beta Moon?

535
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:33,083
They agreed to trade places
for a week

536
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,375
to understand
each other's situation

537
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,458
with more informed eyes.

538
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:40,208
After that,
an agreement came swiftly.

539
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:44,166
Nothing that you have said
is beyond what a schoolchild

540
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,625
could learn
in a history book.

541
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:49,208
What is not
commonly known is that,

542
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:53,125
during those negotiations,
you, Kalin Trose,

543
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:56,875
quelled a plot by
a radical from your own moon

544
00:30:56,875 --> 00:31:00,792
who was attempting to
assassinate the Beta delegate.

545
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,291
It is true.

546
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,709
Perhaps he was wiser
in his youth

547
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,083
than he is now.

548
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:11,834
Odan, you must
convince him to stop.

549
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,500
Will you accept me?

550
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,709
Will you allow me
to work with you?

551
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,750
Yes.

552
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,750
And Alpha Moon?

553
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,208
I will consider it,

554
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,959
but I must consult others.

555
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,875
This is
a typical tactic.

556
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,875
He is an obstructionist.
You can see that.

557
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,000
Kalin Trose,

558
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,417
you may confer
with your people,

559
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:40,125
but we must have your answer
within eight hours.

560
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:43,500
You shall have it.

561
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,917
His vital signs
are overworked.

562
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:06,208
His immune system
is under attack.

563
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:08,333
I can only guess
that he's suffering

564
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,291
from classic
rejection syndrome.

565
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:12,375
Is there any treatment
you can give him?

566
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:14,208
I can administer
an immunosuppressant.

567
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,125
That could help relieve
the symptoms,

568
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:18,000
but it can't correct
the underlying cause.

569
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,417
There is a foreign
organism in his body.

570
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:23,542
Medical school didn't
exactly prepare me

571
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,250
for situations like this.

572
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,417
You're doing all you can.

573
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:32,667
Don't worry about me,
Captain, I'm fine.

574
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,583
Ambassador,
when you feel up to it,

575
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,375
would you join me
in my ready room?

576
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,333
Of course.

577
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:53,083
I can give you something
that should help with the pain,

578
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:55,417
at least for a little while.

579
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:00,834
The pain's gone.

580
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:02,542
Thank you.

581
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,959
Please don't.

582
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:09,041
Please let me touch you...

583
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:10,959
just for a moment.

584
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:16,500
No... please.

585
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:27,375
It was a fast decision,
which we must take as positive.

586
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:30,166
The Alphan representative
has agreed--

587
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,083
however reluctantly--

588
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:33,959
to let you
mediate the dispute.

589
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:37,083
I knew they would.
They're reasonable people.

590
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:39,166
They're just trapped
in their own anger.

591
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:42,125
I have no doubt, however,
that they will bolt

592
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,750
if something goes wrong
in the discussion.

593
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,959
Then it's my job to see
that nothing goes wrong.

594
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,792
Did I say something wrong,
Captain Picard?

595
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:56,125
No, it's just that...

596
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:59,750
for a moment, you sounded
more like Will Riker.

597
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:07,291
We have received
information

598
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:08,834
that the new host will
arrive in 18 hours.

599
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:10,458
Will you be all right
until then?

600
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:14,500
The medication Doctor Beverly
gave me has helped.

601
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,792
I will find a way
to keep going.

602
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,583
Lemon tea.

603
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:42,417
Computer, location
of Doctor Beverly Crusher.

604
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:45,542
COMPUTER: Doctor Crusher
is in her quarters.

605
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:08,125
Can you make<i> balso</i> tonic?

606
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:10,792
COMPUTER:
There is no formula on record.

607
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:14,250
Please supply
a molecular structure.

608
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,375
Never mind.

609
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,041
(<i> door chimes</i> )

610
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,875
Come in.

611
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:39,083
I thought I should see
how you were doing.

612
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:42,166
If you needed
another hypospray.

613
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,041
I don't think so.

614
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,375
The symptoms haven't returned.

615
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:51,625
Oh, well, that's good.

616
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:53,542
Yes.

617
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:57,166
Uh, tomorrow's
an important day.

618
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:59,875
Do you feel
ready for it?

619
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:02,375
I'll be fine.
I've been preparing.

620
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,125
Oh, that's good.

621
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:06,208
Yes.

622
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,834
I'll, um, check your
vital signs in the morning,

623
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:13,458
before the
representatives get here.

624
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:17,458
I don't want them knowing that
I'm taking any medication.

625
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:21,417
Maybe you could schedule
a series of breaks.

626
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:23,542
That's good.
Yes.

627
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:26,250
Beverly, I want you.

628
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,875
If you are going to leave,
you better go right now.

629
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,375
I'm not leaving.

630
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:39,291
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,041
<i>of the two moons are ready</i>

633
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,542
<i>We have learned that</i>
<i>they each have troops massed</i>

634
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:49,750
<i>and are ready for combat,</i>
<i>if this final effort at peace</i>

635
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,667
<i>is not successful.</i>

636
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,625
White count is back up.
Temperature is elevated.

637
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,417
The effects of
the medication

638
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:59,500
are wearing off
faster every time.

639
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,083
I'll administer one now

640
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,667
and hope that it will hold
for an hour or so.

641
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:05,500
No. No more.

642
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:12,250
Ambassador, it's clear
you're in pain.

643
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,667
You can't get through
the next hours without help.

644
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,667
I must.

645
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:20,500
Are the injections damaging to
the host's body, Riker's body?

646
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,166
Yes.

647
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,625
We can't put him
through any further risk.

648
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:28,667
But how can you function,
conduct the meeting?

649
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:31,458
I'll manage.

650
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:36,792
We'll respect your wishes.

651
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:38,709
One more thing--

652
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:41,166
I will conduct
the mediations today.

653
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:46,000
But at the end of today,
regardless of the outcome,

654
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,667
I must be removed
from Riker's body,

655
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,875
even if the new host
has not arrived.

656
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:52,542
But you won't survive.

657
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:56,959
Riker will not survive
if I am not removed.

658
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:59,375
He has done enough.

659
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,792
Your word.

660
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,166
Very well.

661
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,208
WORF:
Worf to Captain Picard.

662
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:11,959
Yes, Mr. Worf?

663
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,291
WORF: The Governor and the two
representatives have returned.

664
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:17,542
I will escort them
to the observation lounge.

665
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,750
PICARD:
Thank you.

666
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,875
(<i> groans</i> )

667
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,625
I'll stand by with
the medication, just in case.

668
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,750
The pain may become so intense
that I'll have to...
Beverly...

669
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:48,417
Whatever else I may be to you,

670
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:50,417
I'm your friend.

671
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:53,417
I can only imagine
what you're going through.

672
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:57,458
And I want you to know,
I'm here.

COMPUTER: 1535 hours.

675
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:25,208
They've been in there
for almost six hours.

676
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:28,542
WORF:
Captain, I am receiving
a message from the ship

677
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:29,917
carrying the Trill host.

678
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:31,417
CRUSHER:
Are they here, Worf?

679
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:33,625
No, they are experiencing
difficulty.

680
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:36,792
They do not anticipate their
arrival for another nine hours.

681
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,750
Nine hours?

682
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,250
(<i> door opening</i> )

683
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,625
It was worth it.

684
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:48,125
Ambassador.

00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,792
(<i> sighs</i> )

686
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,959
They will not go to war.

687
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,667
PICARD:
Mr. Worf, see that
the representatives

688
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,333
are safely transported
off the ship.

689
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,125
Ensign, set a course to
intercept with the Trill vessel.

690
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,834
Prepare to go to warp nine.

691
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:07,500
Sir, it could take more than
two hours to reach the vessel.

692
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,208
I must remove him.
I gave my word.

693
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:27,917
Will is going
to be all right.

694
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:29,625
His vital signs
have stabilized

695
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,709
and he's sleeping now.

696
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:38,709
How is Odan?

697
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:40,834
I've placed him
in stasis.

698
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,625
He's fine for the moment.

699
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:51,375
You need some rest, Doctor.
No.

700
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,291
If Odan is to survive,
he needs to be implanted

701
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:54,875
in the new host
as soon as he arrives.

702
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,625
I'll wait here.
It'll be some time.

703
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,500
I know.

704
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:21,625
Doctor.

705
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:24,125
Is the Trill host here?

706
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,500
Yes.

707
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,625
Good.

708
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,458
Bring him in.

709
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,500
Doctor?

710
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,125
I am Kareel.

711
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,667
I am to become host to Odan.

712
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:54,041
The operation to implant Odan
into the new host

713
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,667
was completed at 1900 hours

714
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:59,041
and appears
to have been successful.

715
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:02,125
There were no difficulties
in assimilation.

716
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:05,375
Doctor Beverly,
could we talk for a moment?

717
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:14,041
You should be sleeping.
You need to rest.

718
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:15,875
I've never felt better...

719
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:17,875
except once or twice.

720
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,709
My poor Beverly.

721
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:27,125
This has been
so hard for you.

722
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:32,417
I want to thank you
for your caring...

723
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:34,583
for your standing by me.

724
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,291
I congratulate you.

725
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:39,959
You averted a war that
would have cost many lives.

726
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:42,500
Yes.

727
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,750
It seems as though

728
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,542
everything has turned out
for the best.

729
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:55,166
And, yes, I am still Odan,

730
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:57,625
and I still love you.

731
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:01,750
I cannot imagine that
ever changing.

732
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,041
I am glad
that you're all right.

733
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:10,083
Is there to be nothing more?

734
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,125
Perhaps it is a human failing,

735
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:22,375
but we are not accustomed
to these kinds of changes.

736
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,375
I can't keep up.

737
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:26,834
How long will you have
<i>this</i> host?

738
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:28,750
What would
the next one be?

739
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:33,083
I can't live with that kind of
uncertainty.

740
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:39,709
(<i> sighs</i> )
Perhaps...

741
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:41,750
someday...

742
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,542
our ability to love

743
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:48,166
won't be so limited.

744
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:54,291
I understand.

745
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:00,333
Odan...

746
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:03,000
I do love you.

747
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,959
Please remember that.

748
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:16,834
I will never forget you.
