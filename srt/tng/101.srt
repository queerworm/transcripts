1
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,792
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

2
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:27,458
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,917
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

4
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:32,917
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

5
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:37,583
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

6
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:41,250
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

7
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:30,250
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41153.7:</i>

8
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,667
<i>Our destination is</i>
<i>planet Deneb IV</i>

9
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:38,792
<i>beyond which lies the great,</i>
<i>unexplored mass of the galaxy.</i>

10
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,792
<i>My orders are</i>
<i>to examine Farpoint,</i>

11
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:48,291
<i>a starbase built there by</i>
<i>the inhabitants of that world.</i>

12
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,625
<i>Meanwhile, I am becoming</i>
<i>better acquainted</i>

13
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,959
<i>with my new command</i>

14
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,333
<i>this Galaxy-class</i>
<i>USS</i> Enterprise.

15
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,125
<i>I am still somewhat in awe</i>
<i>of its size and complexity.</i>

16
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,500
<i>As for my crew,</i>

17
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:07,166
<i>we are short</i>
<i>in several key positions</i>

18
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,583
<i>most notably,</i>
<i>a first officer,</i>

19
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,792
<i>but I am informed that</i>
<i>a highly experienced man--</i>

20
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:13,959
<i>one Commander</i>
<i>William Riker--</i>

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
<i>will be waiting</i>
<i>to join the ship</i>

22
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,959
<i>at our Deneb IV destination.</i>

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,250
You will agree, Data,

24
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,959
that Starfleet's orders
are difficult.

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,625
Difficult?

26
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:26,041
Simply solve the mystery
of Farpoint Station.

27
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,875
As simple as that.

28
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,125
Farpoint Station--

29
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,000
even the name
sounds mysterious.

30
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,834
It's hardly simple,
Data, to negotiate

31
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,917
a friendly agreement
for Starfleet to use the base

32
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,166
while at the same time
snoop around,

33
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,000
finding out how and why
the life-form there built it.

34
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,333
Inquiry--

35
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,417
the word... "snoop"?

36
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,458
Data, how can you
be programmed

37
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,917
as a virtual encyclopedia
of human information

38
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,417
without knowing
a simple word like snoop?

39
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,375
A possibility--

40
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:59,166
a kind of human behavior
I was not designed to emulate.

41
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,875
It means, uh...

42
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,959
to, uh...

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,291
spy, to sneak.

44
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,875
Ah! To seek covertly, to go
stealthily, to slink, slither...

45
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,166
Exactly, yes.

46
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,917
Glide, creep, skulk,
pussyfoot, gum...

47
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:13,959
Yes.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,250
...shoe.

49
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,667
Captain...

50
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,542
I'm sensing a...

51
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,875
a powerful mind.

52
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:27,000
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

53
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,917
Something strange on
this detector circuit.

54
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,375
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

55
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:43,083
DATA:
It registers as solid, Captain.

56
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,709
Or an incredibly
powerful force field

57
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,959
but if we collide with either,
it could be very...

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,250
Shut off that damn noise!

59
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,208
Go to yellow alert!

60
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,750
(<i> alarm stops</i> )

61
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:01,917
Shields and deflectors up, sir.

62
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,500
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

63
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,000
Reverse power-- full stop!

64
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,250
Controls at full stop, sir.

65
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,583
Now reading full stop, sir.

66
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,291
Thou art notified
that thy kind

67
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,583
hath infiltrated the galaxy
too far already.

68
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,917
Thou art directed to return

69
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,208
to thine own solar system
immediately.

70
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,667
That's quite a directive.

71
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:03,083
Would you mind identifying
what you are?

72
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,333
We call ourselves the "Q."

73
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,834
Or thou mayest call me that.

74
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,208
It's all much the same thing.

75
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,250
I present myself to thee
as a fellow ship captain

76
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,875
that thou mayest
better understand me.

77
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:22,458
Go back whence
thou camest.

78
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,667
Stay where thou art.

79
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,709
Data, call medics.

80
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,834
He's frozen!

81
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:40,125
He would not have injured you.

82
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,291
Do you recognize this--
the stun setting?

83
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,625
Knowing humans
as thou dost, Captain,

84
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,000
wouldst thou be
captured helpless by them?

85
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,792
Now, go back,

86
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:53,458
or thou shalt
most certainly die.

87
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,208
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplementary:</i>

88
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,250
<i>The frozen form</i>
<i>of Lieutenant Torres</i>

89
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,125
<i>has been rushed to Sick Bay.</i>

90
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,500
<i>The question now</i>
<i>is the incredible power</i>

91
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:14,792
<i>of the Q being.</i>

92
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,542
<i>Do we dare oppose it?</i>

93
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,083
Captain,

94
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,458
thy little centuries
go by so rapidly.

95
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,417
Perhaps thou will
better understand<i> this.</i>

96
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,333
Actually, the issue
at stake is patriotism.

97
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,083
You must return to your world
and put an end to the Commies.

98
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,041
All it takes are
a few good men.

99
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,333
What?

100
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,959
That nonsense
is centuries behind us.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,917
But you can't deny
that you're still a dangerous,

102
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,542
savage child race.

103
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,083
Most certainly I deny it.

104
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,083
I agree we still were

105
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:53,875
when humans wore costumes
like that 400 years ago.

106
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:55,750
At which time,
you slaughtered millions

107
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,709
in silly arguments
about how to divide

108
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,542
the resources
of your little world.

109
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,125
And 400 years before that,
you were murdering each other

110
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,458
in quarrels
over tribal god images.

111
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,375
Since then,
there are no indications

112
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:07,834
that humans will ever change.

113
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,208
But even when we wore
costumes like that

114
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,333
we'd already started
to make rapid progress.

115
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,291
Oh, yeah? Do you want
to review your rapid progress?

116
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,417
Rapid progress--

117
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:28,041
where humans learned to control
their military with drugs.

118
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,125
Sir, Sick Bay reports

119
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,375
Lieutenant Torres'
condition is better.

120
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:36,375
Oh, concern for one's
fellow comrade.

121
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,000
How touching.

122
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,625
And now,
a personal request, sir.

123
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,250
Permission to clean up
the Bridge.

124
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,875
Lieutenant Worf is right, sir.

125
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:44,709
As security chief, I can't
just stand here and let...

126
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,542
Yes, you can,
Lieutenant Yar.

127
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,500
Oh, better.

128
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:54,583
Then later, on finally
reaching deep space,

129
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,291
humans of course found enemies
to fight out there, too.

130
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,333
And to broaden
those struggles,

131
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,458
you again found allies
for still more murdering.

132
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,333
The same old story
all over again.

133
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:10,333
No. The same old story
is the one we're meeting now--

134
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,125
self-righteous life-forms

135
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,458
who are eager not to learn,

136
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,959
but to prosecute to judge

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,458
anything they don't understand
or can't tolerate.

138
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,792
What an interesting idea.
Prosecute and judge.

139
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:25,125
Suppose it turns out
we understand you humans
only too well.

140
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:29,166
We've no fear of what the true
facts about us will reveal.

141
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,250
Facts about you?

142
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,125
Splendid, splendid, Captain.

143
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,250
You're a veritable fountain
of good ideas.

144
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,834
There are preparations to make,
but when we next meet, Captain,

145
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,834
we'll proceed
exactly as you suggest.

146
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,792
Sir, respectfully submit
our only choice is to fight.

147
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:53,250
Fight or try
to escape.

148
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,250
Sense anything, Commander?

149
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,125
Its mind is
much too powerful.

150
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,458
Recommend
we avoid contact.

151
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,291
From this point,
no station aboard--

152
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,083
repeat-- no station
for any reason

153
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,208
will make use of transmitted
signals or intercom.

154
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,959
We'll try and take them
by surprise.

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,792
Let's see what this
Galaxy-class starship can do.

156
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:19,500
Lieutenant, inform
Engine Room to prepare for
maximum acceleration.

157
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,291
Aye, sir.
Records search, Data.

158
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,250
Results of detaching saucer
section at high warp velocity.

159
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,750
Inadvisable at
any warp speed, sir.

160
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,667
Search theoretical.

161
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,125
It is possible,

162
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,417
but absolutely
no margin for error.

163
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,959
Using printout only,
notify all decks

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
to prepare for maximum
acceleration.

165
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,625
Now hear this. Maximum,
you're entitled to know,

166
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,125
means that we'll be
pushing our engines

167
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,667
well beyond safety limits.

168
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:49,208
Our hope is to surprise
whatever that is out there--

169
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,166
try and outrun it.

170
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,000
Our only other option

171
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,333
is to tuck tail
between our legs

172
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,583
and return to Earth
as they demand.

173
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,291
Engine Room ready, sir.

174
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,000
The board shows green,
Captain-- all go.

175
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,917
Stand by.

176
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,166
Engage.

177
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:02,208
Velocity warp 9.2.

178
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,291
Heading 3-5-1,
mark 11, sir.

179
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,834
Steady on that.

180
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:11,000
The hostile is now giving chase,
sir, accelerating fast.

181
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,917
We're now at warp 9.3, sir,

182
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,750
which takes us
past the red line.

183
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:21,291
PICARD:
Continue accelerating.

184
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,500
Counselor, at this point,

185
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm open to guesses
about what we've just met.

186
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,792
It felt like
something beyond

187
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,709
what we'd consider
a life-form.

188
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,208
Beyond?

189
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,917
Very, very
advanced, sir,

190
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:38,458
or certainly very,
very... different.

191
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,041
WORF:
We're at 9.4, sir.

192
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,375
Hostile is now beginning
to overtake us, sir.

193
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:43,750
Are you sure?

194
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:46,291
Hostile's velocity
is already warp 9.6, sir.

195
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,959
Shall I put them
on the main viewer?

196
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,083
Reverse angle.

197
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,542
Magnifying
viewer image.

198
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,291
Hostile's velocity
is 9.7, sir.

199
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,875
PICARD:
Worf, inform the Engine Room
that we need more.

200
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,458
Engine Room attempting
to comply, sir,

201
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,792
but they caution us...

202
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:10,000
Go to yellow alert.

203
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,500
Arm aft photon torpedoes.

204
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,542
Place them on ready status.

205
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,166
Torpedoes to ready, sir.

206
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,917
Hostile now
at warp 9.8, sir.

207
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,375
Our velocity is only 9.5, sir.

208
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,917
DATA:
Projection, sir.

209
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,291
We may be able to
match hostile's 9.8, sir...

210
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,583
but at extreme risk.

211
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:36,375
Now reading the hostile
at warp 9.9, sir.

212
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:37,959
Now hear this.

213
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,250
Printout message, urgent,
all stations on all decks:

214
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,208
prepare for
emergency saucer-sep.

215
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,041
You will command
the saucer section, Lieutenant.

216
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,709
I am a Klingon, sir.

217
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,417
For me to seek escape when
my Captain goes into battle...

218
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,166
You are a Starfleet officer,
Lieutenant.

219
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,208
Aye, sir.

220
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,291
Make the mark, Data.

221
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,083
Note in ship's log
that at this startime,

222
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:28,208
I'm transferring command
to the Battle Bridge.

223
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:37,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41153.7:</i>

224
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:40,208
<i>Preparing to detach</i>
<i>saucer section</i>

225
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,041
<i>so that families and the</i>
<i>majority of the ship's company</i>

226
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,417
<i>can seek relative safety</i>
<i>while the vessel's stardrive,</i>

227
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,583
<i>containing the Battle Bridge</i>
<i>and main armaments,</i>

228
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,917
<i>will turn back and confront</i>

229
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,458
<i>the mystery that</i>
<i>is threatening us.</i>

230
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,500
Lieutenant, your
torpedoes must detonate

231
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:08,917
close enough
to the hostile

232
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,417
to blind it the
moment we separate.

233
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,000
Understood, sir.

234
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,667
All decks
acknowledging, sir.

235
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:15,333
Worf, this is the Captain.

236
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,959
At the moment of separation,

237
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,667
we will reverse power
just enough

238
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,291
to get your saucer section
out ahead and clear of us.

239
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,500
Understood, Captain.

240
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,959
Torpedoes away, sir.

241
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:37,500
Begin countdown.

242
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:39,750
Mark.

243
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:42,083
Starship separation...

244
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,417
six, five, four,

245
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,875
three, two, one.

246
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,917
Separation successful, sir.

247
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,375
Torpedoes have
detonated, sir.

248
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,917
Let's come to a stop.

249
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,625
Reverse power.

250
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,917
Reverse power.

251
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,959
Decelerating.

252
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,458
Dead stop.

253
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,875
We'll hold this position

254
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,917
and wait for them.

255
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,875
That will bring them here
in just minutes, sir.

256
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:48,291
(<i> sighs</i> )

257
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,000
Will we make a fight of it,
Captain?

258
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,583
If we can at least damage
their ship, we have a chance --

259
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,792
Lieutenant, are you recommending

260
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:58,500
that we fight a life-form
that can do all those things?

261
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,041
I'd like to hear your advice.

262
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,125
I spoke before
I thought, sir.

263
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,375
We should look for some way
to distract them

264
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,542
from going after
the saucer.

265
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,917
O'BRIEN:
All forward
motion stopped, sir.

266
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,709
Thank you, Conn.

267
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,041
Commander,
signal the following

268
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,750
in all languages
and on all frequencies:

269
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,417
We surrender.

270
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:43,417
State that we are not asking
for any terms or conditions.

271
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,792
Aye, sir.

272
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,417
All language forms
and frequencies.

273
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:13,834
(<i> laughter and jeering</i> )

274
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,542
(<i> laughing and talking</i> )

275
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,208
(<i> machine gun fire</i> )

276
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,500
The prisoners will
<i>all</i> stand!

277
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,834
Historically intriguing,
Captain.

278
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,500
Very, very accurate.

279
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,542
Mid-21st century.

280
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,000
The post-atomic horror.

281
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,083
BAILIFF:
All present...

282
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,417
stand and make

283
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:19,000
respectful attention
to honored judge!

284
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,000
Careful, sir.

285
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,250
This is not an illusion
or a dream.

286
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,458
But these courts
belong in the past.

287
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,000
TROI:
I don't understand, either

288
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,792
but this is real.

289
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,208
Get to your
feet, criminals!

290
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,417
At least we're acquainted
with the judge, Captain.

291
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,500
Attention!

292
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:46,458
On your feet! Attention!

293
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:59,333
You are out of order!

294
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:20,500
The prisoners
will not be harmed...

295
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,083
...until they're found guilty.

296
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,542
Dispose of that.

297
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,250
Can we assume you mean
this will be a fair trial?

298
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,208
Yes, absolutely equitable.

299
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,709
BAILIFF:
Before this gracious court

300
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,375
now appear these prisoners

301
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,917
to answer for the multiple
and grievous savageries

302
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:02,125
of the species.

303
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,750
How plead you, criminal?

304
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,875
If I may, Captain...

305
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,917
Objection, Your Honor.

306
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:14,083
In the year 2036,
the new United Nations

307
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,041
declared that no Earth
citizen could be made

308
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,959
to answer for the crimes
of his race or forbears.

309
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,709
Objection denied.

310
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,750
This is a court
of the year 2079,

311
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:26,083
by which time
more rapid progress

312
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:29,500
had caused all "United Earth"
nonsense to be abolished.

313
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:30,834
Tasha, no!

314
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,333
I must, because
I grew up in a world

315
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,959
that allowed things
like this court,

316
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,041
and it was people like these
that saved me from it.

317
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,792
This so-called court

318
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:43,875
should get down on its knees

319
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:46,000
to what Starfleet is,

320
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,125
what it represents.

321
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:08,041
You barbarian!

322
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,583
This woman...

323
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,417
Criminals keep silence!

324
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,500
You've got a lot to
learn about humans

325
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:16,542
if you think you can torture us
or frighten us into silence.

326
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,166
Will she live?

327
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,834
Uncertain.

328
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,333
When he froze Lieutenant
Torres on the Bridge

329
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,083
we had our Sick Bay
to help thaw him out.

330
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,583
You will answer
the charges, criminal.

331
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,625
Or what? Or this?

332
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,083
Or death? Or worse?

333
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,625
You promised the prisoners
will not be harmed.

334
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:38,458
We plead nothing so long as
you break your own rules.

335
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,208
I suggest
you center your attention

336
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,792
on this trial, Captain.

337
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:44,500
It may be your only hope.

338
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:47,166
And I suggest you are now
having second thoughts about it.

339
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,458
You are considering that
if you conduct a fair trial,

340
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,417
which was your promise,
you may lose.

341
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:53,709
Lose?

342
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,375
Yes, even though
you're judge and prosecutor.

343
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:58,667
And jury.

344
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:01,375
Accepted...

345
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,083
so long as you keep
to your agreement,

346
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,625
and assaulting a prisoner
is hardly a fair trial!

347
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:08,959
This is a merciful court.

348
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:30,375
(<i> bell tolling</i> )

349
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,750
Silence!

350
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,625
Continuing
these proceedings,

351
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,750
I must caution you that legal
trickery is not permitted.

352
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:49,125
This is a
court of fact.
...court of fact!

353
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:52,875
We humans know our past
even when we're ashamed of it.

354
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:56,041
I recognize this court system

355
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:59,125
as the one that agreed
with that line from Shakespeare:

356
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,875
"Kill all the lawyers."
Which was done.

357
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:04,750
Leading to the rule
guilty until proven innocent.

358
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:08,542
Of course. Bringing the innocent
to trial would be unfair.

359
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,250
You will now answer
to the charge

360
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:13,166
of being a grievously
savage race.

361
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,333
Grievously savage
could mean anything.

362
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:18,000
I will answer
only specific charges.

363
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:20,166
Are you certain you want
a full disclosure

364
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:22,000
of human ugliness?

365
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,291
So be it, fool.

366
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,166
Present the charges!

367
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:30,792
Criminal, you will read
the charges to the court.

368
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,250
I see no charges
against<i> us,</i> Your Honor.

369
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:56,333
You are out of order.

370
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,542
Soldiers, you will
press those triggers

371
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:14,125
if this criminal answers
with any word other than guilty.

372
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:32,333
Criminal, how plead you?

373
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,041
Guilty...

374
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,417
...provisionally.

375
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,166
The court will hear
the provision.

376
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:54,959
We question
whether this court

377
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,083
is abiding by its own
trial instructions.

378
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,750
Have I your permission
to have Commander Data
repeat the record?

379
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:01,417
There will be no
legal trickery.

380
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:03,166
These will be
your own words, Your Honor.

381
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:06,125
What exactly followed
His Honor's statement

382
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,959
that the prisoners
will not be harmed?

383
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,792
Yes, sir.

384
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:12,208
The Captain had asked
the question

385
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:16,208
(<i> in Picard's voice</i> ):
"Can we assume you mean
this will be a fair trial?"

386
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,458
And in reply,
the judge stated,

387
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,792
(<i> in Q's voice</i> ):
"Yes, absolutely equitable."

388
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:27,834
Irrelevant testimony,
entirely irrelevant.

389
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,625
All right.

390
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,125
We agree there is evidence

391
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,166
to support
the court's contention

392
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,000
that humans have been savage.

393
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:44,000
Therefore, I say test us.

394
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:46,875
Test whether this is
presently true of humans.

395
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:50,166
I see, I see.

396
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:53,458
And so, you petition the court
to accept you and your comrades

397
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,542
as proof of what
humanity has become?

398
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,917
There must be many ways
we can be tested.

399
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,875
We have a long mission
ahead of us.

400
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:03,542
Another brilliant
suggestion, Captain,

401
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:06,875
but your test hardly
requires a long mission.

402
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:10,583
Your immediate destination
offers far more challenge

403
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,792
than you can
possibly imagine.

404
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,917
Yes,

405
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:19,083
this Farpoint Station
will be an excellent test.

406
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:24,667
All present,
respectfully stand.

407
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,458
This court is adjourned

408
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,083
to allow the criminals
to be tested.

409
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:37,417
This honorable court
is adjourned.

410
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:42,417
Stand respectfully.

411
00:29:57,834 --> 00:30:00,542
Captain, you may find
that you are not

412
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:04,166
nearly clever enough to deal
with what lies ahead for you.

413
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:08,917
<i>It may have been better</i>
<i>to accept sentence here.</i>

414
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,917
What is present course, Conn?

415
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,125
It's what it's been
all along, sir--

416
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:31,667
direct heading
to Farpoint Station.

417
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:35,250
Confirmed.
We are on that heading, sir.

418
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,667
Do you know anything
about Farpoint Station, sir?

419
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:39,667
It sounds like
a fairly dull place.

420
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:43,250
We've heard that we may
find it rather interesting.

421
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:55,834
<i>Personal Log,</i>
<i>Commander William Riker,</i>

422
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,750
<i>Stardate 41153.7:</i>

423
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:02,542
<i>The USS</i> Hood<i> has dropped me</i>
<i>off at Farpoint Station</i>

424
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:05,792
<i>where I await the arrival</i>
<i>of the new USS</i> Enterprise

425
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:08,333
<i>to which I have been assigned</i>
<i>as first officer.</i>

426
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,291
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>I've been asked to visit</i>

427
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:13,458
<i>the Farpoint administrator's</i>
<i>office in the old city.</i>

428
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:17,417
Ah, Commander Riker,
I thought you'd want to know

429
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,333
we've still no word
from your vessel.

430
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,458
I trust we've made your
waiting comfortable?

431
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,041
Luxurious is more like it.

432
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,083
Good.

433
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,041
Good.

434
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,959
Would I seem ungrateful
if I asked for some information?

435
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,250
Anything.

436
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,500
Fascinating
the advanced materials used

437
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:36,834
in constructing
this space station.

438
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:39,458
Your energy surplus must be
as abundant as I've heard.

439
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,583
Geothermal energy is one of the
great blessings of this planet.

440
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,959
I'll have all the details
of that sent to your quarters.

441
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,583
Thank you, but it still
seems incredible to me

442
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:51,333
that you could've constructed
this station so rapidly

443
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,250
and so...

444
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,250
and so perfectly suited
to our needs.

445
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:58,875
Would you care for
an Earth delicacy, Commander?

446
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,458
Well, if there's
an apple...

447
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,917
I'm sorry, Commander.

448
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:07,250
Oh, it doesn't matter.
What I was saying was...

449
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,917
I'll be damned.

450
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,834
Ah, yes.

451
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:14,083
There was another
selection here.

452
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,458
Groppler, I could have sworn
this wasn't here a minute ago.

453
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,000
And did your failure to notice
it make it unwelcome?

454
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,542
Not at all, Groppler.

455
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:28,709
I trust it will be the same with
Farpoint Station, Commander.

456
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,542
A few easily answered
questions about it

457
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:35,250
won't make Starfleet
appreciate it less.

458
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,166
And it's delicious.
Thank you.

459
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,834
Good morning,
Groppler Zorn.

460
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,667
Good morning.

461
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:52,000
You have been told
not to do that.

462
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,417
Why can't you understand?

463
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:57,583
It will arouse
their suspicion.

464
00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:01,500
And if that happens,
we will have to punish you.

465
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:04,834
We will.
I promise you.

466
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:15,750
RIKER:
Dr. Crusher!

467
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,166
Mother.

468
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,000
It's Commander Riker.

469
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,667
Hello, Wes.
Enjoying Farpoint Station?
Yes, sir.

470
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:26,834
I saw you. I thought I might
join you for a stroll.

471
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:29,458
Actually, we were
about to do some shopping.

472
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,834
I've been meaning to
visit the mall myself.

473
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,041
Of course.

474
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,500
If you're wondering
about mom,

475
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:39,917
Commander Riker,
she's not unfriendly.

476
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:43,417
She's just shy around
men she doesn't know.
Wesley.

477
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:45,125
I believe that means
he would like us to be friends.

478
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,583
Oh, I'm willing,
Doctor.

479
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,333
Although we're
not officially part
of the<i> Enterprise,</i>

480
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:53,041
I thought there might be
something useful we could
do while we wait.

481
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,875
Useful? How, Commander?

482
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:57,125
Investigating some things
that I've noticed since
I've been here.

483
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:58,792
The last was...

484
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:01,083
Gold would be
lovely with this.
I had asked for an apple...

485
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:03,959
I am sure, Commander, there are
reasons for a first officer to

486
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,959
want to demonstrate his energy
and alertness to a new captain,

487
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,625
but since my duty
and interests

488
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:11,417
are outside
the command structure...

489
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:18,917
Remarkably happened to have
exactly what you asked for?

490
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:22,542
Thank you.

491
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,625
I'll take
the entire bolt.

492
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:27,500
Send it to our starship
when it arrives,

493
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:29,667
charge to Dr. Crusher.

494
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,917
Let's see,
where were we?

495
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:40,542
I was accusing you
of inventing work

496
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,625
in order to curry favor
with our new captain.

497
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:43,959
I apologize.

498
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Mom, that gold pattern
wasn't there.

499
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,500
Maybe this
<i>is</i> something

500
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:50,000
Jean-Luc would
like looked into.

501
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:52,166
Jean-Luc Picard?

502
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,083
You know the Captain.

503
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:59,083
When I was little, he brought
my father's body home to us.

504
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,250
Yes, Wes--
long, long ago.

505
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:05,375
A pleasure to meet you,
Commander.

506
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:07,917
You will excuse us.
My pleasure, Doctor.

507
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,291
Wes.
Sir?

508
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,000
See you on board.

509
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:13,291
Yes, sir.

510
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:16,000
Sir, the<i> Enterprise</i> 
is arriving, but...

511
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:18,583
Is this an official report,
Lieutenant?
Sorry, Commander.

512
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:21,709
Sir, Lieutenant La Forge
reporting the<i> Enterprise</i>
arriving,

513
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,417
but without
the saucer section, sir.

514
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,792
Stardrive section only?
What happened?
I don't know, sir.

515
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,875
Captain Picard has signaled
for you to beam up immediately.

516
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:31,166
Our new Captain
doesn't waste time.

517
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:34,500
It's a good idea.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.

518
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:41,291
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is Commander
Riker at Farpoint Station.

519
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,458
Standing by to beam up.

520
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,917
Lieutenant Yar
of Security, sir.

521
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:17,417
Captain Picard will see
you on the Battle Bridge.

522
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:23,750
With the saucer gone,
can I assume that

523
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,500
something interesting
happened on the way here?

524
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:26,875
Battle Bridge.

525
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:30,208
That's for the Captain
to explain, sir.

526
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,500
Do we have clearance?

527
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:34,458
Aye, sir, into
standard parking orbit.

528
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,834
Make it so.

529
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,875
Commander Riker, sir.

530
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:43,709
Riker, W.T.,
reporting as ordered, sir.

531
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,625
Is the viewer ready?

532
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,333
All set up, sir.

533
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:50,125
We'll first bring you up to date
on a little adventure

534
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,542
we had on our way here,
Commander.

535
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:53,000
Then we'll talk.

536
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:01,000
Welcome aboard.

537
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:04,375
This way, sir.

538
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:18,208
Thou art directed to return

539
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,625
to thine own
solar system immediately.

540
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:26,291
Go back, or thou shalt
most certainly die.

541
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,417
But you can't deny
that you're still

542
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,917
a dangerous,
savage child race.

543
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:33,500
Message from the
saucer module, sir.

544
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,417
It will arrive here
in 51 minutes.

545
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:38,583
Inform them we'll connect
as soon as they arrive.

546
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:41,125
And send the Commander to me
when he's finished.

547
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,041
YAR:
Yes, sir.

548
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,875
...and 400 years before that,
you were murdering each other

549
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:47,959
in quarrels
over tribal god images.

550
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Since then,
there are no indications

551
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,750
that humans will ever change.

552
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:55,125
There are preparations to make,
but when we next meet, Captain,

553
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:58,667
we'll proceed
exactly as you suggest.

554
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:13,834
He calls that
a little adventure?

555
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,083
(<i> door chime</i> )
Come.

556
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:28,208
Not exactly a run-of-the-mill
happening, Captain.

557
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,667
It seems we're alive

558
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:34,083
only because we have been
placed on probation--

559
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:36,333
a very serious
kind of probation.

560
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,583
(<i> beeping</i> )
Go.

561
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:42,333
DATA:
The saucer module now
entering orbit with us, sir.

562
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,125
Acknowledged.

563
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,417
Commander Riker will conduct
a manual docking.

564
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:51,125
Picard out.
Sir?

565
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:52,750
You've reported in,
haven't you?

566
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:54,291
You are qualified?
Yes, sir.

567
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,250
Then I mean now, Commander.

568
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:13,083
You say you will be doing
this manually, sir?

569
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:15,291
No automation?

570
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,375
As ordered.

571
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,667
Velocity to one-half meter
per second.

572
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:54,792
Adjust pitch angle
negative three degrees.

573
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,583
Watch your roll angle, Conn.

574
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,041
All stations
prepare for reconnection.

575
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Thrusters to station keeping.

576
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:47,625
All velocities zero.

577
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:50,250
Her inertia should
do the job now.

578
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:55,125
Lock up...

579
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,917
now.

580
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:43,000
A fairly routine maneuver,

581
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:45,083
but you handled it
quite well.

582
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,125
Thank you, sir.

583
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,250
I hope I show some promise.

584
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:52,750
I do have some questions
for you, however.

585
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:55,125
Yes, sir, I thought you might.

586
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:56,709
I see in your file

587
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,750
that Captain Desoto
thinks very highly of you.

588
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:01,625
One curious thing, however.

589
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:04,750
You refused to let him
beam down to Altair III.

590
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:06,458
In my opinion, sir,

591
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,750
Altair III was too dangerous
to risk exposing the Captain.

592
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:11,625
I see.

593
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,917
A Captain's rank
means nothing to you.

594
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:16,625
Rather the reverse, sir,

595
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,166
but a Captain's life means
a great deal more to me.

596
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,792
Isn't it just possible

597
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:26,375
that you don't get to be
a Starfleet Captain

598
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:29,625
without knowing whether
it's safe to beam down or not?

599
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:32,333
Isn't it a little presumptuous
of a first officer

600
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:35,500
to second-guess
his Captain's judgment?

601
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:38,917
Permission to speak
candidly, sir?

602
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:40,834
Always.

603
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:45,709
Having been
a first officer yourself,

604
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,333
you know that assuming
that responsibility

605
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:51,917
must, by definition, include
the safety of the Captain.

606
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:54,875
I have no problem with following
any rules you lay down--

607
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:56,875
short of compromising
your safety.

608
00:42:56,917 --> 00:42:59,917
And you don't intend
to back off from that position?

609
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:02,083
No, sir.

610
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:06,000
One further thing.

611
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:08,750
A special favor.

612
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,542
Anything, sir.

613
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,917
Using the same strength
you showed with Captain Desoto,

614
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:14,542
I would appreciate it
if you could you keep me

615
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:17,500
from making an ass of
myself with children.

616
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:18,875
Sir?

617
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:20,583
I'm not a family man, Riker,

618
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:23,917
and yet Starfleet has given me
a ship with children aboard.

619
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:25,500
Yes, sir.

620
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:27,500
And I...

621
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:30,834
I don't feel comfortable
with children,

622
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,250
but since a Captain

623
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,291
needs an image of geniality,

624
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:38,542
you're to see
that's what I project.

625
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,542
Aye, sir.

626
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:45,667
Welcome to the<i> Enterprise,</i> 
Commander Riker.

627
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:53,041
Naturally,
I've heard of your case.

628
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:54,959
The visor appliance
you wear is...

629
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,917
LA FORGE:
...is a remarkable piece
of bioelectronic engineering

630
00:43:57,959 --> 00:44:00,500
by which I quote "see"
much of the EM spectrum,

631
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:02,417
ranging from simple heat
and infrared,

632
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:04,834
through radio waves,
et cetera, et cetera,

633
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,834
and forgive me if I've said
and listened to this

634
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:09,166
1,000 times before.

635
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:10,834
You've been blind
all your life?

636
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,375
Mm-hmm. I was born this way.

637
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,792
And you've felt pain all the
years that you've used this?

638
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:17,458
Hmm... They say it's because

639
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,458
I use my natural sensors
in different ways.

640
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:24,750
Well, I see two choices:

641
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:26,500
The first is
pain-killers.

642
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:28,875
Which would affect
how this works.

643
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,041
Mm-hmm.

644
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:32,583
No. And choice number two?

645
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:33,959
Exploratory surgery.

646
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,583
Desensitize the brain
areas troubling you.

647
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:38,709
Same difference.

648
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,417
No, thank you, Doctor.

649
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:45,166
I understand.

650
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:47,291
See you.

651
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:05,291
Yes, sir?

652
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:07,041
Where will I find
Commander Data?

653
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:09,834
Commander Data is
on special assignment, sir.

654
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:12,959
He's using our shuttlecraft
to transfer an admiral
over to the<i> Hood.</i>

655
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,625
An admiral?

656
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:16,792
He's been aboard all day, sir,
checking over medical layout.

657
00:45:16,834 --> 00:45:19,417
Why a shuttlecraft?
Why wouldn't he just beam over?

658
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:21,000
I suppose he could, sir,

659
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:24,000
but the Admiral's a rather...
remarkable man.

660
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:26,417
Have you got some reason
you want my atoms

661
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:29,375
scattered all over space, boy?
No, sir.

662
00:45:29,417 --> 00:45:31,709
But at your age, sir, I thought
you shouldn't have to put up

663
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,750
with the time and trouble
of a shuttlecraft.

664
00:45:33,792 --> 00:45:36,208
Hold it right there, boy.
Sir?

665
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,667
What about my age?

666
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:40,917
Sorry, sir,
if that subject troubles you.

667
00:45:40,959 --> 00:45:42,500
Troubles me?

668
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:46,041
What's so damned troublesome
about not having died?

669
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:48,750
How old do you think
I am, anyway?

670
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:52,250
137 years, Admiral,
according to Starfleet records.

671
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:57,875
Explain how you remember that
so exactly.

672
00:45:57,917 --> 00:46:00,709
I remember every fact
I'm exposed to, sir.

673
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:07,375
I don't see no points
on your ears, boy,

674
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:09,875
but you sound like a Vulcan.

675
00:46:09,917 --> 00:46:11,208
No, sir.

676
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,417
I am an android.

677
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:17,166
Hmm...

678
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,291
...almost as bad.

679
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:22,625
I thought it was
generally accepted, sir,

680
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:26,083
that Vulcans are an advanced
and most honorable race.

681
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,959
They are, they are.

682
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
And damn annoying at times.

683
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,583
Yes, sir.

684
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:34,000
Well, this is
a new ship,

685
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,875
but she's got
the right name.

686
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:39,667
Now you remember
that, you hear?

687
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:40,750
I will, sir.

688
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:44,583
You treat her like a lady

689
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,750
and she'll always
bring you home.

690
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:17,333
Did you signal the<i> Hood,</i> 
Commander Riker?

691
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:20,208
Your exact message:
<i>Bon voyage, mon ami.</i>

692
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,959
Ah, what was the reply,
computer?

693
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,500
Q:
You're wasting time, Captain.

694
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:27,417
Or did you think I was gone?

695
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,208
Lieutenant!

696
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:33,500
Do you intend to
blast a hole in the viewer?

697
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,583
If the purpose of this

698
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:39,458
is to test humans,
Your Honor,

699
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,333
we must proceed
in our own way.

700
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:44,583
You are dilatory.
You have 24 hours.

701
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:48,750
Any further delay
and you risk summary judgment
against you, Captain.

702
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:51,959
Sorry, sir.

703
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,458
You reacted fast, Mr. Worf.

704
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,625
But futilely.

705
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:58,959
I will learn
to do better, sir.

706
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,208
Of course you will.

707
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,625
We've a long voyage
ahead of us.

708
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:10,291
What do we do now, Captain,
with them monitoring

709
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:11,875
our every move
and every word?

710
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:15,333
We do exactly what we'd do
if this Q never existed.

711
00:48:17,417 --> 00:48:18,959
If we're going to be damned,

712
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:21,500
let's be damned
for what we really are.

713
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:28,125
PICARD:
<i>Personal Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41153.8:</i>

714
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:32,208
<i>Of the 24 hours Q allotted us</i>
<i>to prove ourselves,</i>

715
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,875
<i>11 have now passed</i>
<i>without incident.</i>

716
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:37,709
<i>And yet I cannot forget</i>
<i>Q's prediction</i>

717
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,333
<i>that we will face</i>
<i>some critical test.</i>

718
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,000
This planet's interior heat

719
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:44,917
provides an abundance
of geothermal energy,

720
00:48:44,959 --> 00:48:46,917
but it's about all
this world does offer.

721
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:49,208
And it's your belief that this
is what made it possible

722
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:53,375
for them to construct this
base to Starfleet standards?
Yes, sir.

723
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:55,667
We have to assume that
they've been trading
their surplus energy

724
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:57,625
for construction
materials used here.

725
00:48:57,667 --> 00:48:59,291
According to our ship's scans,

726
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:01,709
many of the materials used
are not found on this world.

727
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,542
Perhaps it's like
those incidents

728
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,208
you describe in your report

729
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,875
as almost magical attempts
to please us.

730
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:09,959
Those events did happen, sir.

731
00:49:11,667 --> 00:49:14,542
None of it suggests
anything threatening.

732
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:18,875
If only every life-form
had as much desire to please.

733
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:21,417
Ready to beam down?

734
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,333
I'm looking forward to meeting
this Groppler Zorn.

735
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:27,542
I've a feeling there's
more to it than just trying
to please us, sir.

736
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:30,542
As if it's something
Q is doing to trick us?

737
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,333
Over here.

738
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:35,000
I've asked the Counselor
to join us in this meeting.

739
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:38,709
May I introduce our
new first officer,

740
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,458
Commander William Riker.

741
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,125
Commander Riker, this is our
ship's counselor, Deanna Troi.

742
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:48,959
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>what I taught you, Imzadi?</i>

743
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,583
<i>Can you still</i>
<i>sense my thoughts?</i>

744
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:56,000
A pleasure, Commander.

745
00:49:57,458 --> 00:50:00,333
Likewise, Counselor.

746
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:03,375
Have the two
of you met before?

747
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,500
We have, sir.

748
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:08,375
Excellent.

749
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:14,959
I consider it important
for my key officers

750
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,333
to know each other's
abilities.

751
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,500
We do, sir.

752
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:23,375
We do.

753
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:27,583
<i>I, too, could never</i>
<i>say good-bye, Imzadi.</i>

754
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,208
My crew and I
need more information

755
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,583
before we can make our
recommendations to Starfleet.

756
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:45,125
No objections to that,

757
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:46,583
but I'm puzzled

758
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:48,542
over you bringing
a Betazoid to this meeting.

759
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:52,250
If her purpose, sir,
is to probe my thoughts...

760
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:55,333
I can sense only
strong emotions, Groppler.

761
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:57,500
I'm only half Betazoid.

762
00:50:57,542 --> 00:51:00,291
My father was
a Starfleet officer.

763
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:03,458
I have nothing to hide,
of course.

764
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,959
Good, since we admire

765
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,959
what we've seen of
your construction techniques.

766
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,792
Starfleet may be interested

767
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:13,125
in your constructing
Starbases elsewhere, also.

768
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:16,000
We are not interested
in building other facilities.

769
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:17,583
If I may, Captain.

770
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,583
Then a trade, Groppler.

771
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:23,083
Some things that you need
in return for lending us
architects and engineers

772
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,667
who can demonstrate
your techniques.

773
00:51:24,709 --> 00:51:29,041
Bandi do not enjoy leaving
their homeworld.

774
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:31,333
If Starfleet
cannot accept

775
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,125
that small weakness

776
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:35,500
then we will be forced,
unhappily,

777
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:39,083
to seek an alliance with someone
like the Ferengi...

778
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:43,875
(<i> gasps softly</i> )

779
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:46,250
Counselor,
what is it?

780
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:49,583
Do you want it
described here, sir?

781
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:51,542
Yes, no secrets here

782
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:53,625
if we're to be old friends,
agreed, Groppler?

783
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:55,750
But we ourselves have
nothing to hide, of course.

784
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:02,000
Pain.

785
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:05,208
Pain.

786
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:11,000
Loneliness...

787
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,792
terrible loneliness.

788
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:16,709
Despair...

789
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:23,458
I'm not sensing Groppler, sir,

790
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,875
or any of his people,

791
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:29,458
but it's something
very close to us here.

792
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,542
PICARD:
The source of this, Groppler--

793
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:33,375
have you any idea?

794
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:36,625
No... no, absolutely not.

795
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:40,500
And I find nothing helpful
or productive in any of this.

796
00:52:40,542 --> 00:52:43,208
And that's it?
No other comment?

797
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,125
Well, what do you expect of us?

798
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:47,291
We offer you a base
designed to your needs,

799
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,500
luxurious by even
human standards...

800
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:52,875
While evading even our
simplest questions about it.

801
00:52:52,917 --> 00:52:55,000
We'll adjourn for now.

802
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:59,333
While we all reconsider
our positions.

803
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:01,041
Captain!

804
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:03,750
The Ferengi would be very
interested in a base like this!

805
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:05,792
Fine. Let's hope
they find you

806
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:08,583
as tasty as they did
their past associates.

807
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:23,875
Ensign, could you help me
find Commander Data?

808
00:53:23,917 --> 00:53:25,375
I understand
he's somewhere on this deck.

809
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:27,208
This way, sir.

810
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:31,125
You must be new to these
Galaxy-class starships, sir.

811
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,041
Tell me the location
of Commander Data.

812
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:36,333
Lieutenant Commander Data

813
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:39,417
now located
in Holodeck area 4-J.

814
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:42,625
And as you can see, sir,
it's pointing you that way.

815
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:45,083
Thank you.

816
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:47,375
You're welcome, sir.

817
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:53,834
The next hatchway on your right.
Thank you.

818
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:55,792
You're welcome,
Commander Riker.

819
00:53:55,834 --> 00:53:57,750
And if you care to enter,
Commander...

820
00:53:57,792 --> 00:53:59,875
I do.

821
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:49,417
Hello!

822
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:16,041
<i>(whistling</i> 
"Pop Goes the Weasel")

823
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:35,375
Marvelous how easily
humans do that.

824
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:37,875
I still need much practice.

825
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,542
There's some
puzzles down on...

826
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,834
...down on the planet
that the Captain wants answered.

827
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,250
He suggested I take you
with me on the away team
that I'll be leading.

828
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:50,917
I shall endeavor
to function adequately, sir.

829
00:55:50,959 --> 00:55:53,041
Yes.

830
00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:01,583
When the Captain suggested you,
I looked up your record.

831
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,959
Yes, sir. A wise
procedure, sir, always.

832
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,417
Then your rank of Lieutenant
Commander is honorary?

833
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:08,750
No, sir.
Starfleet class of '78.

834
00:56:08,792 --> 00:56:11,166
Honors in probability
mechanics and exobiology.

835
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:13,000
But your file says
that you're a...

836
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:15,500
A machine. Correct, sir.
Does that trouble you?

837
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,583
To be honest,
yes, a little.

838
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:20,583
Understood, sir.
Prejudice is very human.

839
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:22,625
Now that does trouble me.

840
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:24,792
Do you consider yourself
superior to us?

841
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:26,625
I am superior, sir,
in many ways.

842
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:30,291
But I would gladly
give it up to be human.

843
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:34,375
Nice to meet you...
Pinocchio.

844
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:37,417
A joke.

845
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:41,041
Ah! Intriguing.

846
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:44,959
You're going to be an
interesting companion, Mr. Data.

847
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,750
This woodland pattern
is quite popular, sir,

848
00:56:54,792 --> 00:56:57,291
perhaps because it
duplicates Earth so well.

849
00:56:57,333 --> 00:57:00,125
Coming here almost makes
me feel human myself.

850
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:03,000
I didn't believe these
simulations could be this real.

851
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:04,834
Much of it is real, sir.

852
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:07,250
If the transporters
can convert our bodies
into an energy beam

853
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,125
then back to
the original pattern...

854
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:11,125
Yes, of course, and these
rocks and vegetation

855
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:14,458
have much simpler
patterns.
Correct, sir.

856
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,125
The rear wall.

857
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,625
I can't see it.

858
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,375
We're right next to it.

859
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,208
Incredible.

860
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:37,125
WESLEY:
Commander Riker!

861
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:39,917
Commander Riker,
isn't this great?

862
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:42,250
This is one
of the simple patterns.

863
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:43,959
They've got thousands more.

864
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,750
Some you just can't believe.

865
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:48,625
Careful, the next rock
is loose!

866
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,333
Wesley!

867
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:03,041
Wow!

868
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:10,291
(<i> holodeck door opens</i> )

869
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:17,375
Mr. Data has agreed to join me
on the away team, Captain.

870
00:58:17,417 --> 00:58:20,250
Very good, Commander.

871
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:25,458
Sir, maybe I should get
something to wipe this water up?

872
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,875
Good idea.

873
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,458
There's a low-gravity
gymnasium, too.

874
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,291
It would be hard
to get bored on this ship.

875
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:43,000
Good.

876
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:52,125
Mom, could you get me
a look at the Bridge?

877
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:54,208
That's against
the Captain's standing orders.

878
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,291
Are you afraid
of the Captain, too?

879
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,166
I certainly am not.

880
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:02,083
But Captain Picard
is a pain, isn't he?

881
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:04,417
Your father
liked him very much.

882
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,583
Great explorers
are often lonely--

883
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,834
no chance to have a family.

884
00:59:09,834 --> 00:59:11,709
Just a look
at the Bridge.

885
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,917
I'll stay in the turbolift
when the doors open.

886
00:59:13,959 --> 00:59:15,208
I won't get off.

887
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,917
You are asking
for trouble, Wes.

888
00:59:24,542 --> 00:59:26,583
We'll see what we can do.

889
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,250
YAR:
Recommend that
someone could begin

890
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:43,667
by examining the underside
of the station, sir.

891
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:45,959
Our sensors do show
some passages, sir.

892
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,834
Perhaps you and I.

893
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,667
Tasha, you and the Counselor.

894
00:59:49,709 --> 00:59:52,041
And, Geordi, I want
your eyes down there.

895
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:54,208
You and I will start topside.

896
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,333
Have you noticed
anything unusual?

897
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,083
I can't see as well
as Geordi, sir,

898
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:32,291
but so far, the material
seems rather ordinary.

899
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:33,500
Construction records?

900
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:35,000
Construction records
shows this to be

901
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:37,792
almost identical to that
which Starfleet uses.

902
01:00:39,959 --> 01:00:41,917
YAR:
Team leader.

903
01:00:41,959 --> 01:00:44,000
We found something interesting.

904
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:47,583
We're in a passageway directly
under the station, sir.

905
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:49,166
But these tunnel walls

906
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:51,291
are something
I've never seen before, sir.

907
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:53,083
How are you
examining them, Geordi?

908
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:56,750
In every way: microscopically,
thermally, electromagnetically.

909
01:00:56,792 --> 01:00:58,500
None of it
is familiar.

910
01:00:58,542 --> 01:01:00,709
RIKER:
And what about you, Troi?

911
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:05,375
Sir, I've avoided
opening my mind.

912
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:08,083
Whatever I felt
in the Groppler's office

913
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:09,875
became very uncomfortable.

914
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:12,792
I'm sorry, Counselor, but you
must, we need more information.

915
01:01:18,959 --> 01:01:20,750
Pain.

916
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:24,166
Such pain.

917
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,792
Pain.

918
01:01:26,834 --> 01:01:28,125
Hang on. I'm coming.

919
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:30,000
<i>Enterprise,</i> lock us on
to her signal.

920
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:42,792
I'm sorry.

921
01:01:42,834 --> 01:01:44,125
Close your mind
to the pain.

922
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:46,959
Unhappiness.

923
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,750
Terrible despair.

924
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:52,834
Who?

925
01:01:53,834 --> 01:01:56,458
I don't know.

926
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,417
No life-form
anything like us.

927
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:02,041
What in the hell kind
of place is this?

928
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:03,959
Geordi, what do you see?

929
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,875
Well, it's of...

930
01:02:06,917 --> 01:02:10,417
it's of no material
I recognize, sir,

931
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:13,041
or have even heard of.

932
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,250
What the hell...

933
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:40,750
Children are not allowed
on the Bridge.

934
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:49,083
Permission to report
to the Captain.

935
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:51,667
Dr. Crusher.

936
01:02:51,709 --> 01:02:54,166
Captain.

937
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:57,375
Sir, my son is not
on the Bridge.

938
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:59,542
He merely accompanied me
on the turbolift.

939
01:03:04,583 --> 01:03:06,333
Your son?

940
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:09,542
His name's Wesley.

941
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:12,208
You last saw him
years ago when...

942
01:03:22,959 --> 01:03:25,000
Well...

943
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:28,834
...as long as he's here.

944
01:03:31,709 --> 01:03:33,750
I, uh...

945
01:03:34,834 --> 01:03:37,500
I knew...

946
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:41,333
I knew your father, Wesley.

947
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:46,333
Want to look around?

948
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:07,709
But don't touch anything.

949
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:27,375
Try it out.

950
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:37,208
The panel on your right
is for log entries,

951
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,291
library-computer access
and retrieval,

952
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,917
view screen control
and intercoms and so on.

953
01:04:41,959 --> 01:04:44,667
Here we have...
On here, the backup
conn and ops panels

954
01:04:44,709 --> 01:04:46,583
plus shield
and armament controls.

955
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:50,208
The forward view screen
is controlled from
the ops position...

956
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:53,417
...which uses high-resolution,
multispectral imaging sensors.

957
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:55,041
How the hell do you
know that, boy?

958
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,458
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

959
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,250
Perimeter alert, Captain!
Wesley!

960
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,792
I'm sorry, I didn't...

961
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:01,041
Wes, you shouldn't have
touched anything.

962
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:02,333
Get off the Bridge,
both of you.

963
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:03,667
We have a perimeter
alert, sir.

964
01:05:03,709 --> 01:05:05,875
As my son tried to tell you.

965
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:11,291
Picard. Go ahead.

966
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:13,083
SECURITY:
Ship's sensors have
detected the presence

967
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:14,750
of a vessel
approaching this planet.

968
01:05:14,792 --> 01:05:17,083
No ship is scheduled
to arrive at this time, sir.

969
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:19,750
Have Commander Riker
and his team beam back up.

970
01:05:19,792 --> 01:05:22,083
Security, could that be
the<i> Hood</i> returning here?

971
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:25,667
The vessel does not match
the<i> Hood's</i> configuration
or ID signal.

972
01:05:25,709 --> 01:05:28,208
Put it on main viewer.

973
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,625
Identification?

974
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:31,792
Vessel unknown,
configuration unknown, sir.

975
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,917
Hail it.

976
01:05:42,959 --> 01:05:46,542
We've been trying, sir--
no response.

977
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:52,291
Raise all shields.

978
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:53,875
Phasers at ready.

979
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:56,709
Shields up, sir,
phasers ready.

980
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:14,542
PICARD:
Get me Groppler Zorn

981
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:17,875
and continue universal
greetings on all frequencies.

982
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:19,667
This is Zorn, Captain.

983
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:23,125
Zorn, an unidentified vessel
has entered into orbit with us.

984
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:25,083
Do you know who it is?

985
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:27,458
There are no ships scheduled
to arrive until...

986
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,875
I asked you
if you knew who it is.

987
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:31,792
You mentioned the
Ferengi alliance to me.

988
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:36,291
But we've had
no dealings with them.

989
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:38,709
It was only a... a thought.

990
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,875
Are you certain?
I promise you, Captain.

991
01:06:40,917 --> 01:06:43,041
We were making an empty threat.

992
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:46,166
I wanted your cooperation.
Forgive me.

993
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:48,625
Definitely entering
orbital trajectory, sir.

994
01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:51,000
It measures 12 times
our volume, Captain.

995
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:26,291
The sensors say we were
just scanned, sir.

996
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:33,542
Pain again?

997
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:38,000
Troi, you've been
at it enough.

998
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:39,792
No.

999
01:07:39,834 --> 01:07:42,250
I feel close to
an answer of some kind.

1000
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:46,250
Commander, something down here
is shielding our communicators.

1001
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:48,208
Yes.

1002
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,125
That's exactly the feeling
I've been reading--

1003
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,917
as if someone doesn't want us
to be in touch with our ship.

1004
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,542
Come on.
Let's get to the surface.

1005
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:05,750
There is no computer record
of any such vessel, sir.

1006
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:07,417
Nothing even close.

1007
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,041
Still no response, sir.

1008
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:10,917
We've done everything
but threaten them.

1009
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:16,667
Sensor scans,
Mr. Worf.

1010
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:19,917
Our sensor signals
just seem to bounce off.

1011
01:08:19,959 --> 01:08:21,959
Something's happening, sir.

1012
01:08:24,417 --> 01:08:26,750
They're firing
on Farpoint, sir.

1013
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:29,542
Bring photon torpedoes
to ready.
Wait, sir.

1014
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:31,959
They're hitting the old Bandi
city, not Farpoint Station.

1015
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,917
Those stairs are where
we entered down here, sir.

1016
01:08:52,959 --> 01:08:56,250
At this point it becomes
ordinary stone, sir,
matching what's above.

1017
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:01,375
My God, was that
a phaser blast?

1018
01:09:01,417 --> 01:09:03,917
DATA:
Negative, but something similar.

1019
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:08,709
You, Tasha, and Geordi
will beam up to the ship now.

1020
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,000
Come on. I want to see
exactly what's happening.

1021
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:18,125
Don't! If you should be hurt...

1022
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:20,750
You have your
orders, Lieutenant.

1023
01:09:20,792 --> 01:09:22,625
Carry them out.

1024
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:24,125
Yes, sir.

1025
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,291
I'm sorry, sir.

1026
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:31,250
<i>Enterprise,</i> 
three to beam up.

1027
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:44,333
<i>Enterprise, Enterprise,</i> 
come in.

1028
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:46,458
Help us, please.

1029
01:09:48,792 --> 01:09:50,333
What shall we do?

1030
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:52,667
<i>Enterprise,</i> help us, please!

1031
01:09:52,709 --> 01:09:54,625
Tune that down.

1032
01:09:54,667 --> 01:09:56,792
Commander Riker, come in.
Can you hear me?

1033
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:04,709
Riker to<i> Enterprise,</i> 
come in.

1034
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,291
PICARD:
Commander Riker, come in.
Where are you?

1035
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:10,291
With Data, on the edge
of the old city, sir.

1036
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:13,375
It's being hit
hard, sir.

1037
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:14,834
And Farpoint Station?
Any damage there?

1038
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:17,542
Negative on damage
to Farpoint, sir.

1039
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:19,166
Whoever they are,

1040
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:20,750
they're carefully avoiding
hitting the Station.

1041
01:10:20,792 --> 01:10:22,583
It's from
an unidentified vessel

1042
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:24,208
that's entered
into orbit with us here.

1043
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:26,709
No ID, no answer
to our signals.

1044
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,959
The old Bandi city's
being hit hard, sir.

1045
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,333
Many casualties
very probable.
Understand, Commander.

1046
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:34,542
Would you object to
your Captain ordering

1047
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:36,375
a clearly illegal kidnapping?

1048
01:10:36,417 --> 01:10:38,834
No objection, sir.

1049
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:41,667
Groppler Zorn may have
the answers we need.

1050
01:10:41,709 --> 01:10:43,417
Get him-- bring him here.

1051
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:45,375
Aye, sir.

1052
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:55,250
They're forcing a very difficult
decision on me, Counselor.

1053
01:10:55,291 --> 01:10:58,542
But I doubt protecting
the Bandi would violate
the Prime Directive.

1054
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:00,583
True, they are not
actual allies, but...

1055
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:04,750
We are in the midst of
diplomatic discussions
with them.

1056
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:07,875
Lieutenant, lock
phasers on that vessel.

1057
01:11:07,917 --> 01:11:10,583
Phasers locked on,
Captain.

1058
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,667
Typical, so typical.

1059
01:11:15,709 --> 01:11:19,041
Savage life-forms never follow
even their own rules.

1060
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:29,375
Get off my Bridge!

1061
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:31,458
Interesting, that
order about phasers.

1062
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,208
Standing by
on phasers, Captain.

1063
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:36,041
Please, don't let me interfere.
Use your weapons.

1064
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,625
With no idea of who
is on that vessel,

1065
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:39,542
my order was a routine
safety precaution.

1066
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:42,250
Really? No idea of
what it represents?

1067
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:44,208
The meaning of that
vessel is as plain...

1068
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:47,542
as plain as the noses
on your ugly little
primate faces.

1069
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,583
And if you were truly
civilized, Captain,

1070
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:51,625
wouldn't you be doing something
about the casualties

1071
01:11:51,667 --> 01:11:53,917
happening down there?

1072
01:11:53,959 --> 01:11:56,750
Captain to CMO.
Are you reading any of this?

1073
01:11:56,792 --> 01:11:59,583
Medical teams already preparing
to beam down, Captain.

1074
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:01,792
Compliments
on that, Doctor.

1075
01:12:01,834 --> 01:12:03,750
Any questions?

1076
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:06,959
Starfleet people are trained
to render aid and assistance
whenever...

1077
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,166
But not trained
in clear thinking.

1078
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:11,291
Let's consider
<i>your</i> thoughts.

1079
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:13,125
You call us savages
and yet you knew

1080
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:15,375
those people down there
were going to be killed.

1081
01:12:15,417 --> 01:12:17,583
It is<i> your</i> conduct
that is uncivilized.

1082
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:20,583
Sir, they're firing
on the planet again.

1083
01:12:23,417 --> 01:12:24,875
Go to maneuvering jets.

1084
01:12:24,917 --> 01:12:27,083
Position us between
that vessel and the planet.

1085
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:28,834
Force fields full on.

1086
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:31,625
Aye, sir.

1087
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:33,834
Impulse power to...

1088
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:36,792
We have no ship control, sir.

1089
01:12:38,542 --> 01:12:39,959
It's gone.

1090
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:58,166
Are you undamaged?

1091
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:00,291
Yes. You?

1092
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:10,458
All systems operating.

1093
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:28,625
(<i> sobbing</i> )

1094
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:31,500
Please. Make it stop!

1095
01:13:31,542 --> 01:13:33,625
You can drive it away.

1096
01:13:33,667 --> 01:13:36,083
Drive who away,
Groppler?

1097
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:38,041
I don't know.
DATA:
Unlikely, sir.

1098
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,750
Our records show
you supervised

1099
01:13:39,792 --> 01:13:42,291
all Bandi contact
with other worlds.

1100
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:44,000
We've done nothing wrong.

1101
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:46,333
Then if we can learn
nothing from you...

1102
01:13:46,375 --> 01:13:48,041
we'll leave.

1103
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:49,959
No! Oh, no, please,
don't leave.

1104
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,917
I'll... try to explain.

1105
01:13:52,959 --> 01:13:55,250
(<i> screaming</i> )

1106
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:04,083
First Officer
to<i> Enterprise.</i>

1107
01:14:06,917 --> 01:14:09,083
We've lost Zorn.

1108
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:12,583
Something like
a transporter beam

1109
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:14,166
seems to have
snatched him away.

1110
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:18,667
Question, sir.
Could it be this Q?

1111
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:20,750
None of you knows
who transported him.

1112
01:14:20,792 --> 01:14:22,750
You're running out
of time, Captain.

1113
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:26,834
Captain, suddenly
I'm sensing something else.

1114
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:32,041
Satisfaction.

1115
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:34,166
Enormous satisfaction.

1116
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,542
PICARD:
From the same source
as before?

1117
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:38,166
No, that was on the planet.

1118
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:39,166
This is much closer.

1119
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,583
Excellent, Counselor.

1120
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:43,208
He's such a dullard,
isn't he?

1121
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,959
Captain,
from Transporter Room:

1122
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,250
First Officer and Mr. Data
have beamed aboard.

1123
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:50,792
Excellent, also.

1124
01:14:50,834 --> 01:14:52,625
Perhaps with more of
these little minds helping...

1125
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:54,041
That is enough, damn it!

1126
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:56,083
Have you forgotten that
we have an agreement?

1127
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:57,375
An agreement which
you are, at this moment,

1128
01:14:57,417 --> 01:14:59,208
breaking by taking
over our vessel

1129
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,250
interfering with my decisions.

1130
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,834
Either leave or finish us!

1131
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,458
Temper, temper,
<i>mon capitaine.</i>

1132
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,667
I'm merely trying to
assist a pitiful species,

1133
01:15:09,709 --> 01:15:11,667
but perhaps I will leave...

1134
01:15:11,709 --> 01:15:14,250
if Commander Riker provides me
with some amusement.

1135
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:15,834
Do nothing that he asks.

1136
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:19,041
But I ask so little,
and it's so necessary

1137
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:20,583
if you're to
solve all this.

1138
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:23,041
Beam over there with
your what do you call it?

1139
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:24,542
Your "away team"?

1140
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:26,667
I'll risk none of my crew
on that unknown.

1141
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:28,875
You should already know
what you'll find there,

1142
01:15:28,917 --> 01:15:32,166
but perhaps it's too adult
a puzzle for you.

1143
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:35,667
With all respect, Captain,
I want to beam over there.

1144
01:15:35,709 --> 01:15:38,417
You show promise,
my good fellow.

1145
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:41,709
Have you understood any part
of what he's tried to tell you?

1146
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,709
Humanity is no longer
a savage race.

1147
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,709
But you must still
prove that.

1148
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,959
At least you impressed him,
Number One.

1149
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,041
That's hopeful.

1150
01:15:58,083 --> 01:16:00,792
Thank you, Captain.

1151
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,250
Captain, if he's not open
to evidence in our favor,

1152
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:06,333
where will you go
from there?

1153
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:07,917
I'll attend to my duty.

1154
01:16:07,959 --> 01:16:09,250
To the bitter end?

1155
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:12,375
I see nothing
so bitter about that.

1156
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,834
Can I help you, Captain?

1157
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:24,709
I, uh...

1158
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:28,625
I didn't want you thinking me
harsh, cold-blooded.

1159
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,542
Why, oh, why
would I ever think that?

1160
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:33,625
I didn't welcome you aboard
personally, professionally.

1161
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:35,834
I made you come to me
on the Bridge.

1162
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:37,583
I yelled at your son,

1163
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:40,792
who, as you pointed out,
was quite correct.

1164
01:16:40,834 --> 01:16:42,375
He does seem to have

1165
01:16:42,417 --> 01:16:45,041
a very good grasp of
starship operations.

1166
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:48,625
You've just won
this mother's heart, Captain.

1167
01:16:48,667 --> 01:16:50,750
Ah.

1168
01:16:50,792 --> 01:16:54,750
But, now,
your assignment here...

1169
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:57,375
I would...

1170
01:16:57,417 --> 01:17:00,166
consider and approve

1171
01:17:00,208 --> 01:17:02,709
a transfer for you.

1172
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,458
Oh.

1173
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,834
Do you consider me
unqualified?
Hardly.

1174
01:17:07,875 --> 01:17:11,000
Your service record shows
you're just the chief
medical officer I want.

1175
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:12,959
Then you must object to me
personally.

1176
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,667
I'm trying to be considerate
of your feelings, Doctor.

1177
01:17:15,709 --> 01:17:18,583
For you to work
with a commanding officer

1178
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:20,834
who would
continually remind you

1179
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:23,291
of a terrible,
personal tragedy...

1180
01:17:23,333 --> 01:17:25,542
If I had had any objections
to serving with you,

1181
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:28,291
I wouldn't have requested
this assignment, Captain.

1182
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:31,542
You requested this posting?

1183
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:34,250
My feelings about my husband's
death will have no effect

1184
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:37,208
on the way I serve you,
this vessel, or this mission.

1185
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:41,625
Ah.

1186
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:44,333
Then welcome aboard,
Doctor.

1187
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:46,291
<i>Riker to Picard.</i>

1188
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:49,583
<i>We're ready to beam over, sir.</i>

1189
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:52,959
I, uh...I hope
we can be friends.

1190
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,291
Thank you.

1191
01:18:06,792 --> 01:18:08,583
Phasers on stun.

1192
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:16,166
Energize.

1193
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:37,500
Most interesting, sir.

1194
01:18:39,417 --> 01:18:41,417
Much the same
construction we saw

1195
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:43,000
in the underground tunnel.

1196
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:45,458
But no sound of power.

1197
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,500
No equipment.

1198
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:50,041
How does this ship run?

1199
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:54,542
(<i> gasp of pain</i> )
What is it, Troi?

1200
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:56,917
Is it the same
as you felt down there?

1201
01:18:56,959 --> 01:18:58,709
No.

1202
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:01,917
This is much
more powerful.

1203
01:19:01,959 --> 01:19:05,583
Full of anger.

1204
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:07,542
Hate.

1205
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:08,959
Toward us?

1206
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,834
No.

1207
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:14,542
It's directed down
toward the old Bandi city.

1208
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,667
Most intriguing
again, sir.

1209
01:19:16,709 --> 01:19:19,917
The place that
this vessel was
firing upon

1210
01:19:19,959 --> 01:19:21,709
was not the
Farpoint Starbase

1211
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:24,959
but the home of those
who constructed...

1212
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:29,709
Sorry, sir.

1213
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:33,583
I seem to be
commenting on everything.

1214
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:35,792
Good.

1215
01:19:35,834 --> 01:19:37,667
Don't stop, my friend.

1216
01:19:43,667 --> 01:19:46,000
<i>Enterprise,</i> Riker.

1217
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:50,166
This is turning out to be a very
long tunnel or corridor, sir.

1218
01:19:50,208 --> 01:19:52,000
No ship's crew in sight.

1219
01:19:52,041 --> 01:19:54,875
No sign of mechanism
or circuitry.

1220
01:19:54,917 --> 01:19:57,750
No controls or readouts.

1221
01:19:59,166 --> 01:20:02,458
This is nothing like
any vessel I've seen before.

1222
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,792
Groppler Zorn, sir...

1223
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:07,959
in great fear, just ahead.

1224
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,834
There is a different feeling
here than in the tunnel.

1225
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:14,250
Very different.

1226
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:18,959
ZORN (<i> in distance</i> ):
No, please! No more, please!

1227
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,083
No more!

1228
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:26,625
Please, make it stop the pain!

1229
01:20:26,667 --> 01:20:31,625
Please...
make it stop the pain!

1230
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:36,208
No, please! No more!

1231
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:39,625
Please! No more!

1232
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:41,166
Please!

1233
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:42,959
Zorn, can you hear me?

1234
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,709
Make it stop the pain!

1235
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:47,750
(<i> screaming</i> )

1236
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:50,125
Has the alien communicated?

1237
01:20:50,166 --> 01:20:52,041
Please!

1238
01:20:52,083 --> 01:20:54,834
That's it, sir.

1239
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:58,000
It's just one alien
I'm sensing here.

1240
01:20:58,041 --> 01:21:01,667
Please, I don't understand
what you want!

1241
01:21:01,709 --> 01:21:03,125
Not true.
He does know.

1242
01:21:03,166 --> 01:21:06,041
ZORN:
No, please! No more!
Please! No more!

1243
01:21:06,083 --> 01:21:09,500
(<i> crying</i> )

1244
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:12,959
No! Don't! Don't!

1245
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:23,208
Captain!

1246
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:26,500
PICARD:
Transporter Chief,
yank them back-- now!

1247
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,291
Riker, acknowledge.

1248
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:32,375
Your time is up, Captain.

1249
01:21:32,417 --> 01:21:36,000
Transporter Chief,
do you have their coordinates?

1250
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:38,250
Transporter Chief!
He can't hear you, Captain.

1251
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:40,375
Transporter Chief, come in!

1252
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:49,625
I've people in trouble
over there, Q.

1253
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,834
Everyone at ease.
That's an order.

1254
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:04,291
Q, my people are in trouble.

1255
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:06,500
Let me help them, please.

1256
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:13,333
I'll do whatever you say.

1257
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,458
You'll do whatever I say?

1258
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:27,542
Seems I did make
that bargain.

1259
01:22:27,583 --> 01:22:29,208
The agreement
isn't valid, sir.

1260
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,917
It wasn't Q that saved us.

1261
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:33,000
Save yourself.
It may attack you now.

1262
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:35,875
It was<i> that</i> which
sent us back, Captain.

1263
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:39,375
Yes, sir. It is not merely
a vessel-- somehow it is alive.

1264
01:22:39,417 --> 01:22:41,667
She lies! Destroy it
while you have a chance.

1265
01:22:41,709 --> 01:22:43,834
Make phasers and
photon torpedoes ready.

1266
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,291
No, do nothing
he demands.

1267
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:47,333
Captain, that thing
was killing my people.

1268
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:49,792
Was there a reason?
It is an unknown, Captain.

1269
01:22:49,834 --> 01:22:51,417
Isn't that enough?

1270
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:53,625
If you'd earned that
uniform you're wearing,

1271
01:22:53,667 --> 01:22:56,417
you'd know that the unknown
is what brings us out here.

1272
01:22:56,458 --> 01:22:58,917
Wasted effort,
considering human intelligence.

1273
01:22:58,959 --> 01:23:00,625
Let's test that!

1274
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:03,125
Beginning with the tunnels you
have under Farpoint, Groppler.

1275
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:06,583
Identical to those on the space
vessel life-form over there.

1276
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:08,667
Why was it punishing you,
Groppler?

1277
01:23:08,709 --> 01:23:12,125
In return for some pain
you've given another creature?

1278
01:23:12,166 --> 01:23:13,834
We've done nothing wrong!

1279
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:15,709
It was injured.
We helped it.

1280
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:20,208
Thank you.

1281
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,750
That was the
missing element.

1282
01:23:22,792 --> 01:23:27,542
Lieutenant Yar, rig main phaser
banks to deliver an energy beam.

1283
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:28,750
Aye, sir.

1284
01:23:28,792 --> 01:23:30,417
You're right, Captain.

1285
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:33,250
It has to be conceivable
that somewhere in this galaxy

1286
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:36,750
there could exist creatures able
to convert energy into matter.

1287
01:23:36,792 --> 01:23:39,875
And into specific
patterns of matter

1288
01:23:39,917 --> 01:23:41,542
just as our transporters do.

1289
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,959
On the viewer, Captain.

1290
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:20,083
Groppler...

1291
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:24,709
you captured something
like that, didn't you?

1292
01:24:26,458 --> 01:24:30,000
Warn my people, please, to leave
Farpoint Station immediately!

1293
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:31,417
He lies, Captain.

1294
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:33,000
Shouldn't you let
his people die?

1295
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:34,333
Transmit the message:

1296
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:36,041
"Leave Farpoint Space
Station immediately."

1297
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:38,375
TROI:
Then it was a pair
of creatures I was sensing--

1298
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:41,750
one down there
in grief and pain,

1299
01:24:41,792 --> 01:24:44,875
the other up here,
filled with anger.

1300
01:24:44,917 --> 01:24:47,208
DATA:
And firing not on
the new space station,

1301
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:50,542
but on the Bandi
and their city.

1302
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:54,750
Attacking those
who had captured...

1303
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:58,709
captured its mate.

1304
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:07,000
Energy beam ready, sir.

1305
01:25:08,041 --> 01:25:09,959
Lock it in on
Farpoint Station.

1306
01:25:11,709 --> 01:25:15,208
I see now it was
too simple a puzzle.

1307
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:19,000
Generosity has always
been my... weakness.

1308
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:22,458
Let it have whatever
it can absorb.

1309
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,125
Energize.

1310
01:25:42,542 --> 01:25:45,041
Now getting feedback
on the beam, sir.

1311
01:25:45,083 --> 01:25:47,458
Discontinue it.

1312
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,500
Groppler Zorn...

1313
01:25:49,542 --> 01:25:52,417
there will soon be
no Farpoint Station

1314
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:53,959
if I'm right about this.

1315
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Lucky guess!

1316
01:26:14,667 --> 01:26:17,333
Please believe me,

1317
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:19,291
we meant no harm
to the creature.

1318
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:20,792
It was starving for energy.

1319
01:26:20,834 --> 01:26:23,000
Which your world furnishes
you in plenty.

1320
01:26:23,041 --> 01:26:24,500
And we did feed it.

1321
01:26:24,542 --> 01:26:26,667
But only enough
to keep it alive

1322
01:26:26,709 --> 01:26:28,417
so that you could force
it to shape itself

1323
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:30,583
into whatever
form you needed.

1324
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:47,792
Sir...

1325
01:27:47,834 --> 01:27:50,709
it's wonderful!

1326
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:57,458
A feeling of great joy...

1327
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:01,917
and gratitude.

1328
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,542
Great joy...

1329
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:10,250
and gratitude...

1330
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:15,542
from both of them.

1331
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:36,000
Why...

1332
01:28:36,041 --> 01:28:39,583
do you use other life-forms
for your recreation?

1333
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:41,834
If so, you've not
provided the best...

1334
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:44,875
Leave us! We've passed
your little test.

1335
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:47,333
Temper, temper,
<i>mon capitaine.</i>

1336
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:49,000
Get off my ship.

1337
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:52,083
I do so only because
it suits me to leave.

1338
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:58,583
But I will not promise
never to appear again.

1339
01:29:11,667 --> 01:29:15,750
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 41174.2:</i>

1340
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:17,625
<i>The agreement</i>

1341
01:29:17,667 --> 01:29:20,083

1343
01:29:21,792 --> 01:29:23,041
All stations?

1344
01:29:23,083 --> 01:29:25,041
Ready for departure, sir.

1345
01:29:27,667 --> 01:29:29,291
Some problem, Riker?

1346
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:31,250
Just hoping this isn't
the usual way

1347
01:29:31,291 --> 01:29:32,792
our missions
will go, sir.

1348
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:34,333
Oh, no, Number One.

1349
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:37,375
I'm sure most will be
much more interesting.

1350
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:42,500
Let's see what's out there.

1351
01:29:44,291 --> 01:29:45,375
Engage.
