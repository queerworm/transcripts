1
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:20,041
The hospital facility
will be located there.

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:23,458
Facing north
in that grove of trees.

3
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,333
And the school
and the art center

4
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,208
will be standing there,

5
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,875
centrally located
among the residential pods.

6
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,542
Very good.

7
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,792
At this rate, we can bring
the next wave of colonists in

8
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:36,917
in about six months.

9
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:39,417
I've got to tell you,
I envy you.

10
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:42,500
This is a beautiful place
to put down roots.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,542
Somehow, Riker,
you don't strike me

12
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:46,709
as the kind that
puts down roots.

13
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:49,166
No? How do I strike you?

14
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,875
As a free spirit.

15
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,625
As an adventurer.
An adventurer?

16
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,125
Aren't you pioneers
all adventurers at heart?

17
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,375
Of course,

18
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,500
but we also have
this nesting instinct.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,417
It's exciting
to find a new world,

20
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:06,041
but the joy comes
in making it a home--

21
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,583
building houses,
having children.

22
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,542
Very interesting.

23
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,083
I'd love to discuss this
further with you.

24
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,709
Dinner tonight?

25
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,542
If you want to share
camp rations in my tent,

26
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:19,959
I'd be delighted.

27
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,291
Haven't we gotten you
a replicator yet?

28
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,417
No, we haven't.

29
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:28,458
But I've been saving up my
ration of dried chicken curry.

30
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:32,208
It should go nicely
with that bottle of wine

31
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,291
I happen to know
you brought with you.

32
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,875
This is sounding better
all the time.

33
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,667
And as you know...

34
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:43,333
I provide the most
memorable desserts.

35
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:46,417
My favorite part of dinner.

36
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,500
DR. CRUSHER:
Will, Carmen.

37
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,959
We've been going over
the schematics for the hospital.

38
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,583
The location seems fine.

39
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,125
When the<i> Enterprise</i> 
comes back tomorrow,

40
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,750
we'll get a crew
started on that.

41
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,542
(<i> loud whirring</i> )

42
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:02,709
Carmen, have you got
construction started
I didn't know about?

43
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,667
No.
What is that?

44
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,000
Data?

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,750
I do not recognize
the sound.

46
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,583
I believe it is
coming from above.

47
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,959
Will, what is it?

48
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:21,208
Data, what's our
best bet for cover?

49
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,917
Subterranean caverns
to the east, sir. Doctor?

50
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:26,709
Will...
Start gathering
everyone together.

51
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,583
We've seen this before.
We know what it is.

52
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,667
Now get moving.

53
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:11,291
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

54
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,792
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

55
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,875
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

56
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,208
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

57
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:25,834
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

58
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:30,083
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

59
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,291
Follow him!
Let's go!

60
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,583
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

61
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,709
Follow him!

62
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,667
No! Stay together!

63
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,250
Stay together! This way!

64
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,583
This way! This way!

65
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,792
I've got him!
I've got him!

66
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,917
Will!

67
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,208
Help us!

68
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,166
Data!

69
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,500
Carmen!

70
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,333
Captain, censors indicate
a disturbance

71
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,041
near the outpost
on Melona IV.

72
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,375
What kind of
disturbance?

73
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,000
I cannot tell.
We are still too far away.

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,834
It could be
an electrical storm.

75
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,917
See if you can
contact the colony.

76
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,083
WORF: Aye, sir.

77
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,959
Captain, there is no response
from Melona colony,

78
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,792
but the disturbance in
the atmosphere is increasing.

79
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,542
How far are we?

80
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:25,208
At current speed, 27 hours.

81
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,667
Bridge to La Forge.
La Forge here, Captain.

82
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:31,166
Are you picking up
any readings from Melona?

83
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,875
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,792
Something strange is going on.

85
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:37,375
There are violent disruptions
in the atmosphere.

86
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,709
Ensign, increase
to warp eight.

87
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,458
Come on!
Keep moving!

88
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:49,083
Watch your step,
but keep moving.

89
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,000
RIKER:
Let's go. Let's go.

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,500
Keep moving.
Deep into the cave.

91
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,291
Come on.
Be careful.

92
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,792
Deep into the cave.
Keep moving.

93
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,333
How much protection
will this cave give us?

94
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,917
The refractory metal
in the rock formation

95
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,542
may act
an effective barrier.

96
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,709
Let's seal off
this entrance.

97
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,166
Let's hope there's
enough air in here.

98
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,542
There's got to be
a ventilation source somewhere.

99
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,625
We need some light.

100
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,000
How are the others?

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,208
Uh, just scrapes
and bruises, I think.

102
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,583
I'll check further.
Where's Carmen?

103
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,834
She didn't make it.

104
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:03,709
She was trying to save
an old man who had fallen.

105
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,792
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:14,834
I think we're going to be
all right in here.

107
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:16,834
I'm not sure about
the air supply, so stay put.

108
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,583
Don't move around.

109
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,500
Don't expend
any unnecessary energy.

110
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,792
With any luck, we'll be able
to wait this thing out.

111
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,792
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

112
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,583
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

113
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,750
Commander, the refractory
metal in the rock strata

114
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,583
may also interfere
with communication.

115
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,667
Data, we've only seen the
Crystalline Entity once before.

116
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,750
How do you know these metals
will protect us?

117
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm not entirely certain
they will, sir.

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,333
I was afraid you were going to
say something like that.

119
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,458
WORF:
Sir, the disturbance on Melona
<i>is</i> becoming more intense.

120
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,792
Keep hailing them.
All channels, Mr. Worf.

121
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:29,667
Captain, the fact that
they're not responding

122
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:32,250
doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything wrong.

123
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,875
The atmospheric disturbance
could be jamming the signal.

124
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,792
I know, Counselor.

125
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,083
Still no response, sir.

126
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:48,625
Increase to warp nine.
How long, Mr. Worf?

127
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,375
WORF: Six hours.

128
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,875
I've got one man unconscious.

129
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,875
We can't stay in here
much longer.

130
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,875
If we open that entrance
and it's still out there,

131
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,125
we're dead.

132
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,709
If we all stay in here,
we're dead.

133
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:26,083
It has been over an hour
since we heard the entity, sir.

134
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,667
It may be gone.

135
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:31,625
Or it may be waiting
out there for us.

136
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,792
(<i> rumbling</i> )

137
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,375
Everybody stay here.

138
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,375
WORF:
Commander.

139
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,583
Commander Riker,
are you there?

140
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,291
Lieutenant Worf,
I don't think I've ever
seen a more beautiful sight.

141
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,625
It's good to see
you're all right, Commander.

142
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,166
What happened here?

143
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,542
The Crystalline Entity
paid us a visit.

144
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:26,959
We lost two colonists,
but we got the rest in here.

145
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:21,291
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45122.3:</i>

146
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,291
<i>We have notified</i>
<i>Starfleet Command</i>

147
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,834
<i>of our intention</i>
<i>to pursue and investigate</i>

148
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,625
<i>the Crystalline Entity.</i>

149
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:31,333
<i>To that end, we have been</i>
<i>joined by Dr. Kila Marr,</i>

150
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,959
<i>a xenologist who has made</i>
<i>studying the entity</i>

151
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,709
<i>her life's work.</i>

152
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,125
Welcome to the<i> Enterprise.</i> 
I'm Commander William Riker.

153
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,959
Commander, Dr. Kila Marr.
We're glad you're here.

154
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,000
You were on the surface
during the attack?

155
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,083
That's right.
Remarkable.

156
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,333
You and your group
are the only known beings

157
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,166
ever to survive an assault
by the Crystalline Entity.

158
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,834
We were lucky.
I should say.

159
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:55,834
And your android,
he was there, too?

160
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:59,291
Lieutenant Commander Data
was there, yes.

161
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,417
Well, shall we get started?

162
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,417
I'll be glad to show you
to your quarters.

163
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,083
Oh, Commander,
a chance to talk

164
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,500
to survivors so soon
after an attack?

165
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,625
I've been waiting
years for this.

166
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,834
I don't want to waste
a moment more.

167
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,125
...and when we came out of the
cave, there was nothing left.

168
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,667
Everywhere we looked,
there was complete devastation.

169
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:26,667
Trees gone.
Nothing.

170
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,125
That's typical.

171
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,500
It could take years
for anything to grow again.

172
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,917
DATA:
Doctor, I ran a full
spectrographic analysis,

173
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,417
section by section,

174
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:37,250
trace elements confirm
it<i> is</i> the same entity

175
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,750
which destroyed the colony
on Omicron Theta.

176
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,458
The Crystalline Entity
seems to function

177
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,458
like a gigantic
electromagnetic collector.

178
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,792
It needs a lot of power
to keep going,

179
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:51,625
so it strips every form of life
from the worlds it encounters

180
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,542
and converts it all
into energy.

181
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:57,041
There was no vegetation, no
insects, not even soil bacteria.

182
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,208
It left nothing.

183
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,792
Except witnesses

184
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:03,583
for the first time
in 11 recorded attacks.

185
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,583
Now, why, I wonder,

186
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,667
did it spare your group?

187
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,625
It didn't spare
everyone, Doctor.

188
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,250
If you'll check your records,

189
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,625
you'll find that two of
the colonists did not survive.

190
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,291
My point is
that until now,

191
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,583
there have never been
<i>any</i> survivors.

192
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,750
DATA: Doctor, the cave in which
we hid was made of rock

193
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,792
which contained
heavy concentrations

194
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:25,208
of kelbonite
and fistrium.

195
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,875
We surmise
that the entity

196
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,667
was unable to
penetrate that barrier.

197
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:32,458
I would like to do interviews
with each of the survivors.

198
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,542
Collect as much
specific detail as I can

199
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:37,041
from their observations.
Of course.

200
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,291
And I'd like to inspect
the remains in Melona colony
as soon as possible.

201
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,125
Commander Data,
you will accompany the Doctor
to the surface.

202
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,667
Yes, sir--
If you don't mind, Captain,

203
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,083
I prefer to choose my own team.

204
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,417
Doctor, there is
no one on this ship

205
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:51,125
with more knowledge
of the Crystalline Entity

206
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,667
than Commander Data.

207
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:55,041
He originated
on Omicron Theta.

208
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,959
I am aware of his origins.

209
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,542
I'm very much aware
that his brother Lore

210
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,375
worked with
the Crystalline Entity,

211
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,208
led it to Omicron Theta,
where it killed

212
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,875
every living thing.

213
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,750
I don't think
it's unreasonable

214
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,750
that I should prefer
to make another choice.

215
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,375
You may request
additional team members,

216
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,500
but in the best interests
of this investigation,

217
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,959
I think you should work
with Commander Data.

218
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,000
As you wish, Captain.

219
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,125
Well?

220
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,333
I don't think you need an empath
to sense that woman's feelings.

221
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,667
There's hostility
that she seems

222
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,625
to have transferred
from Lore to Data.

223
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,500
Perhaps you shouldn't have
forced them together so soon.

224
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,250
If her discomfort is going
to affect her judgment

225
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,458
or her objectivity,

226
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,166
I need to know now.

227
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,041
Doctor,
there is evidence

228
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,458
of residual bitrious matter
in the soil.

229
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,166
It was not present
before the entity's attack.

230
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,709
Doctor?

231
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:36,000
Dr. Marr,

232
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,166
you have made it clear
that my presence disturbs you.

233
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,667
However, I do not see
how we can achieve our task

234
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,291
if you continue
to ignore me.

235
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,250
Commander, I can hear
everything you say to me.

236
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,458
If there is anything
worth my response,

237
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,583
you can be sure
I will not be silent.

238
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,875
Then I do not understand
your lack of interest

239
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,792
in the bitrious filament
I mentioned.

240
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,500
It's old news to me.

241
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,375
I found evidence of bitrium
on the last three attack sites.

242
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,834
It seems to be a residual
that the entity produces

243
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:08,792
after it absorbs
living matter.

244
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:11,375
I'm actually more
interested in this cave.

245
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,834
It still amazes me

246
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:19,917
that your group was spared.

247
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:23,500
As I have speculated,
the presence of refractory...

248
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,125
Refractory metals--
yes, I know.

249
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:30,041
On two separate occasions,

250
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,125
settlers sought refuge
in caves--

251
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,917
some of them deeper
than this one.

252
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,458
They perished anyway.

253
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,875
Were those caves laced
with kelbonite or fistrium?

254
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,250
The tunnels on Forlat III
had strong deposits

255
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,542
of kelbonite, yes.

256
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:52,834
Then perhaps the combination
of the two metals prevented...

257
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,333
Perhaps it was you.

258
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,625
I do not understand.

259
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,709
Maybe it was your presence
that made the entity

260
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:04,625
pass over the people
in this cave.

261
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,542
Did that occur to you?

262
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,208
I cannot see what effect
my being here would have had...

263
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,875
If you had been in contact
with the entity--

264
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,792
if that's the reason
Melona was attacked--

265
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,709
it surely wouldn't have
killed its ally.

266
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,792
You believe that
I lured the entity here?

267
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:27,000
Did you?
No, Doctor.

268
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,792
Because Lore betrayed
the colonists on Omicron Theta,

269
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:34,125
you believe that I am capable
of the same behavior.

270
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,125
You are mistaken, Doctor.

271
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,458
My programming is distinctly
different from Lore's.

272
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,709
You don't understand,
I am accusing you

273
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,917
of collaborating
with that monster.

274
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:45,083
I do understand,

275
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,709
and I am attempting to explain
to you it is impossible.

276
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,667
It's amazing.

277
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,875
You can't feel anything,
can you?

278
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,041
Nothing I say to you
hurts you.

279
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,458
That is true, Doctor.

280
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,083
I'm getting a slight elevation

281
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,250
of monocaladium particulates
in this cave wall--

282
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,250
are you making note of it?
Yes, Doctor.

283
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,208
My son died on Omicron Theta.

284
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,458
He was 16 when
the colony was attacked.

285
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,667
That is the reason
I have become an expert

286
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:21,417
on the Crystalline Entity.

287
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:25,000
I have spent my life
studying it,

288
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,250
tracking it and hoping
one day to find it.

289
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:32,667
And if I learn that
you have been helping that thing

290
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,583
in any way whatsoever,

291
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,291
I will see to it
that you are disassembled

292
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,583
piece by piece.

293
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,000
Okay, Doctor,
we've input all the data

294
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,166
you collected on the surface.
Just a minute, Commander.

295
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,250
I have some cellulose
readings from soil samples

296
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,333
that weren't included.

297
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,667
You handle that unit
like a veteran, Doctor.

298
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,625
One thing about
spending your life

299
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,917
gathering information--

300
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,750
you learn your way
around computers.

301
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,291
Hydrocarbons slightly elevated,

302
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,375
bitrious filaments
in trace amounts.

303
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,875
Lanthanides...

304
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,208
nitrates...

305
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,875
all normal.

306
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,375
Nothing different.

307
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,041
Everything falls
within the parameters

308
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,709
I established
at the other attack sites.

309
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:30,875
Were you expecting a different
result this time, Doctor?

310
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,959
I've never surveyed a site
so soon after an attack.

311
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,834
I thought I'd find
something new--

312
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,542
something that would
make a difference.

313
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:40,583
Doctor, have you ever
scanned your samples

314
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,875
for gamma radiation?

315
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,834
Why would I do that?

316
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:46,000
We are seeing
high-energy reactions

317
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,959
that may show up
in a gamma scan.

318
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:49,917
And if they do,
we might find a pattern,

319
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:52,250
a kind of marker left
behind by the entity.

320
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,959
That's a good idea, Data.

321
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:58,875
Frankly, I just don't see
what that would get us.

322
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,917
If the entity left
a residual trace

323
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:03,250
of anti-proton in
the samples we collected,

324
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,458
a gamma radiation scan
would reveal that.

325
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,125
Getting that
readout now, Data.

326
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:13,333
If we try
a logarithmic scale,

327
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,083
we will have
better resolution.

328
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,083
GEORDI:
There it is. See it?
DATA: Yes.

329
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,834
Doctor?

330
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,041
A sharp spike at ten K.E.V.

331
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,709
Another...

332
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:34,542
a pattern.

333
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:37,000
So we know the entity
leaves anti-protons behind.

334
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
If it also deposits
anti-protons in space

335
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,291
as it travels,
can we detect them?

336
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,166
Sure, we can set
the ship's lateral sensors

337
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,000
for gamma radiation.

338
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,792
Well, let's get to it,
shall we?

339
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,500
It seems I owe you
thanks, Commander.

340
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,750
The thanks actually go to a
Dr. Clendenning of Omicron Theta

341
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,709
who did the first experiments
with gamma scans.

342
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:08,125
I never read that.
It wasn't in any of his records.

343
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,500
That is correct,

344
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,000
but I possess
much of his knowledge.

345
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
He was working
on new detectors

346
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,250
at the time of the attack
on Omicron Theta.

347
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,125
I'd heard
you'd been programmed

348
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,041
with the experiences
of the colonists,

349
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,291
but frankly, I find it
hard to believe.

350
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:28,375
Bridge.
It is true, Doctor.

351
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,125
The contents of
their logs and journals

352
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,208
were transferred
into my memory cells.

353
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,375
The man who created me
also experimented

354
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,083
with scanning
the synaptic patterns

355
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,792
of the colonists'
temporal lobes

356
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:40,750
and programming them
into my neural nets.

357
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,166
You possess their thoughts?

358
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,792
To some degree.

359
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:46,291
Dr. Soong hoped to provide me

360
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,667
with an amalgam
of the colonists' memories.

361
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,834
Interesting.

362
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:02,291
DR. MARR:
There-- a spike at ten K.E.V.

363
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,917
And again.

364
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:06,250
It's the same pattern
we saw in Engineering.

365
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,417
Mr. Data, can you project
a course from it?
DATA: Yes, sir.

366
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:11,709
There are two
possible destinations--

367
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:14,250
the Brechtian Cluster
and the Argos system.

368
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,083
Is either populated?
Yes, sir.

369
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:19,166
The Brechtian Cluster
has two inhabited planets.

370
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:22,166
Ensign, set a course
for the Brechtian Cluster.

371
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,250
Captain, I've done
some preliminary estimates

372
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,834
on a firing pattern
we need to destroy the entity.

373
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:31,375
The photon torpedoes
will require some reprogramming,

374
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,208
but with your permission,
I'll give the calculations
to Lieutenant Worf.

375
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:37,333
Reprogram the torpedoes,
Mr. Worf.

376
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,417
But let's hope
we don't have to use them.

377
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,625
I beg your pardon?

378
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,667
If we can possibly avoid
firing on it...

379
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,625
Aren't you going to kill it?

380
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:51,417
Perhaps you should join me
in my Ready Room.

381
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,709
I don't understand.

382
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:05,667
Why are we pursuing the entity
if not to destroy it?

383
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:07,125
We're not hunters, Doctor,

384
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,834
nor is it our role
to exact revenge.

385
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,458
What do you propose?

386
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,792
We track it down,
greet it warmly,

387
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,166
and ask it if it would mind

388
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,250
terribly not ravaging
any more planets?

389
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,834
I don't deny that it may
be necessary to fire on it,

390
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,959
but I look on that
as a last resort.

391
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,917
Why? Why not just kill it?

392
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:27,333
I want to try
to communicate with it.

393
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,125
What?

394
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,583
We know from
our own experience

395
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:36,041
that our shields
will protect us.

396
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,625
So long as we are
in no danger,

397
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,709
I will make every effort
to communicate.

398
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,000
To what end?

399
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
If we can determine
what its needs are,

400
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,625
we might find other sources
to supply it.

401
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:51,041
Its needs are to slaughter
people by the thousands.

402
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:53,667
It is nothing
but a giant killing machine.

403
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,458
Doctor,
the sperm whale on Earth

404
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:58,208
devours millions of cuttlefish
as it roams the oceans.

405
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,667
It is not evil.
It is feeding.

406
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,500
The same may be true
of the entity.

407
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,917
That would be small comfort for
those who have died defeated.

408
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:09,000
We're not talking
about cuttlefish.

409
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,667
We're talking about people.

410
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:13,834
I would argue that
the Crystalline Entity

411
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:16,417
has as much right
to be here as we do.

412
00:25:20,709 --> 00:25:22,917
Now, Commander Data
has some theories

413
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:25,458
on how we might communicate.

414
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,500
Please confer with him.

415
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:40,875
(<i> classical music</i> )

416
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,208
(<i> door chiming</i> )

417
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,375
Come in.

418
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,625
Am I disturbing you?

419
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,625
Not at all, Doctor.

420
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,667
Commander, there's
something I want to say.

421
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,959
You have been helpful
to me and kind,

422
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:25,625
and I repaid you
with accusations,

423
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,458
and I realize
I may have been wrong.

424
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,625
That is very gracious of you
to say, Doctor,

425
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,667
but I have not
been injured by you.

426
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:38,125
Captain Picard has told me
you've done work

427
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:41,250
in trying to establish
communication with the entity.

428
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,959
That is true.

429
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:45,667
I have experimented with
producing vibrations in crystals

430
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:47,709
by means of graviton pulses.

431
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:49,834
Like tapping on
a crystal goblet.

432
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,291
Exactly.

433
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,959
I will call up the results
I have achieved thus far

434
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:55,875
for you to study.

435
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,917
All right.

436
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,792
Commander,
just what kind of memories

437
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:06,875
do you retain of
the colonists?

438
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,500
I do not possess the
minute-to-minute remembrances

439
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,875
of each person,

440
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,458
although the more
intense recollections

441
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,166
are contained
in my memory banks.

442
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,125
Do you have any of
my son's memories?

443
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,083
Marr... Raymond.

444
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,959
Called "Renny."
Yes, I do.

445
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:30,208
I see.

446
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,625
And his journals?

447
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:36,500
Yes.

448
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:41,125
I was wondering...

449
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:44,792
do you know...

450
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:47,041
did he blame me?

451
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,917
Blame you?

452
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,417
For going away.

453
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,542
For leaving him
on Omicron Theta.

454
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:58,792
There are no records
of any blame against you.

455
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:01,875
I left him with friends.

456
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:05,083
I chose to pursue
my own career.

457
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:09,625
I planned to go back,
but things kept interfering.

458
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:14,583
I kept thinking,
"I'll go next month"...

459
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:20,041
but there weren't
any more next months.

460
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,667
There are no records

461
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:24,125
of any negative thoughts
about you.

462
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:27,375
His personal journals
indicated that he was proud

463
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:30,000
that you were such
a fine scientist.

464
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,959
He was?

465
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:34,875
What else do you know?

466
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,583
RIKER:
Commander Data, Dr. Marr,

467
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,750
report to the Bridge
immediately.

468

MAN: We are being chased
by an unidentified entity

469

traveling at warp speed...

470
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:52,125
A distress call from a ship
called the<i> Kallisko.</i>

471
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,917
It's being pursued
by an unknown object.

00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:56,750
MAN: Sensors indicate

473

PICARD: How strong are
your shields, Captain?

475
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:04,208
MAN: We are a transport ship.
Our shields are minimal.

476
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:07,792
Do you carry weapons?
MAN:
Only low-level particle phasers.

477
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:10,750
Do you know
what this being is?

478
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,333
<i>Kallisko,</i> change course.
Take evasive action.

479
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,917
Do whatever you can
to outrun it.

480
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:17,417

00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,417
I cannot, sir.

487
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,500
There is no response.

488
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:43,709

490
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,000
Mr. Riker,
prepare an away team.

491
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:01,333
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45125.7:</i>

492
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,959
<i>An away team</i>
<i>led by Commander Riker</i>

493
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:07,333
<i>has conducted a thorough survey</i>
<i>of the alien ship</i> Kallisko

494
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:10,458
<i>and has returned to</i>
<i>the</i> Enterprise<i> to report.</i>

495
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,041
Pretty much as we expected,
sir, no survivors.

496
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,333
Not a trace of anything
that was ever alive--

497
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:23,000
not even a seed
in their greenery storage.

498
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,125
Warp and impulse engines
are down, sir, but they
can be restarted.

499
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,625
A skeleton crew could take
the ship to a Starbase.

500
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,375
No, we don't have time
for that now.

501
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:32,291
Mr. Worf, send a message
to the nearest Starbase.

502
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:34,291
Ask them to dispatch a crew.
Aye, sir.

503
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,625
PICARD: Mr. La Forge,
make certain that we're
still picking up

504
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:39,250
the gamma radiation patterns
of the entity.
Aye, sir.

505
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,125
Have you and Commander Data
made any progress

506
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,792
in finding a means
of communication?

507
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:45,208
I believe so. There are
some things to iron out.

508
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,583
Please keep working at it.
We may need it soon.

509
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,458
Deck 17.

510
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:02,291
Doctor, you've
seemed preoccupied

511
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,709
since we surveyed
the<i> Kallisko.</i>

512
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:11,208
I've found it easy

513
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:14,000
to talk to you, Commander.

514
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,750
Do you mind
if I tell you something?

515
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,333
Not at all.

516
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:24,041
After hearing the screams
of those men,

517
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,417
I-I've found it hard

518
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,750
not to think about my son...

519
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:32,792
about what happened to him.

520
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:37,709
I've read stories

521
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:39,750
about soldiers
in the battlefield--

522
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,125
wounded... dying.

523
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,417
They call out for their mothers,

524
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:47,291
And I've often wondered if

525
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:49,625
my son called out for me.

526
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,333
If, uh,

527
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:57,208
he died wondering
why I didn't come to him.

528
00:31:57,208 --> 00:32:00,041
(<i> door opens</i> )

529
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,750
(<i> door chimes</i> )

530
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,291
Come.

531
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,000
It's still headed for
the Brechtian Cluster.

532
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,041
We've reestablished
our course.

533
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,125
Very well.

534
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,250
Oh, one thing,
Number One--

535
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,750
Starfleet will be notifying

536
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,458
Carmen Davila's parents
of her death

537
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,250
and returning
her personal effects.

538
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,250
Would you care to
enclose a letter?

539
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,709
Yes, sir.
I'd like that very much.

540
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:37,250
Is there something more,
Number One?

541
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,000
Permission
to speak freely, sir?

542
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,792
Of course.

543
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:47,208
I've been thinking
maybe Dr. Marr is right.

544
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:49,500
Maybe we should
destroy the entity.

545
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:55,125
Why do you think that?

546
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:57,542
It's already killed thousands.

547
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:01,333
It will undoubtedly continue
to kill unless we stop it.

548
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:03,583
I don't want those deaths
on my conscience.

549
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:07,542
Are you sure that
that's it, Number One?

550
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:10,792
Or are you being influenced
by personal feelings?

551
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:16,208
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not a raw cadet.

552
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:19,125
I've lost people
on missions before.

553
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:22,542
If we take time to try
to communicate with this thing,

554
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,542
we may lose our chance
to destroy it.

555
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:28,291
And I don't think
we can risk that.

556
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,375
I think I'll go write that
letter to Carmen's family.

557
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,917
We should program
the Bridge science station

558
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:45,542
to vary the emissions
we direct toward the entity.

559
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:48,083
I'll write a subroutine
that will allow us

560
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,875
to change the frequency
of the graviton beam.

561
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,375
Data...

562
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:01,458
you told me you carried
some of my son's memories.

563
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,834
That is correct, Doctor.

564
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,333
What can you tell me
about Renny?

565
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,834
What were those thoughts?

566
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:12,792
Was he... happy at all
on Omicron Theta?

567
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:16,667
I have some
vivid memories of

568
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,875
sporting events.

569
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:21,709
He played Parrises Squares
with a group of his schoolmates.

570
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:24,709
Renny started Parrises Squares
when he was young--

571
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:26,750
too young, really--

572
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,125
but the older children
kept asking him to play

573
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,500
and I couldn't
keep him away.

574
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,917
He had this natural gift.

575
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:35,500
Yes.

576
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,959
He was pleased to have won
a championship emblem.

577
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,959
He wrote me about that.

578
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,709
He was so proud.

579
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:45,917
I'm characterizing pulse
widths in nanoseconds.

580
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,625
Sound right to you?
Yes, Doctor.

581
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,875
Your son's most
intense memories

582
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:57,333
revolve around
a young woman named Janina.

583
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:00,208
A girlfriend?

584
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,667
Oh, I never knew about that.

585
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,208
Of course,
the last person he would tell

586
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,250
would be his mother.

587
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,291
What was she like?

588
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,834
He enjoyed her kindness...

589
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:14,667
her gentleness...

590
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,625
her physical attributes.

591
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:21,917
There.

592
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:23,417
Now we can vary
all the parameters

593
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,208
directly from the Bridge.

594
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,250
Yes, Doctor.

595
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:31,750
Could you do
something for me?

596
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,875
It would mean a lot.

597
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,458
I would be happy
to be of help.

598
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:40,458
You see, all I have
left of Renny--

599
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:43,375
the only connection
I have of him--

600
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,208
is there,
inside your head.

601
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:53,417
I was wondering if you
would talk to me in his voice.

602
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,500
I know you have
the ability

603
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,625
to sound like other people,
isn't that right?

604
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:01,542
That is true, Doctor,
but what would you have me say?

605
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:06,917
Maybe something
from his journals?

606
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,959
Many of his journal entries

607
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:13,041
took the form of letters
to family and friends.

608
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,291
I could access
one of those.

609
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:29,834
(<i> voice of adolescent boy</i> )
I took my last exam today.

610
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:33,250
I think I did all right
on everything except
cellular biology.

611
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,125
I know you think
it's important, Mom,

612
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:39,792
but I don't see how I'm ever
going to use that stuff.

613
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:41,792
In a couple of weeks,

614
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:43,875
a bunch of us are going
on an archaeological dig

615
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,583
in the mountains.

616
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,417
The Wallaces said
it would be all right

617
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:50,792
as long as we had
<i>adult</i> supervision.

618
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,667
So don't worry, Mom.

619
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:55,417
They're looking out for me.

620
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:59,458
They're really great people,
and I like them a lot,

621
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:02,458
but they're
kind of serious.

622
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:05,917
They don't have
your sense of humor, Mom.

623
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:09,417
Mom... I miss you.

624
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,500
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45129.2:</i>

625
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,250
<i>We are still in pursuit</i>
<i>of the Crystalline Entity.</i>

626
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,583
<i>Data and Doctor Marr</i>
<i>are prepared to attempt</i>

627
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:31,125
<i>communication with the being</i>
<i>when we intercept it.</i>

628
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,917
<i>I will admit to some</i>
<i>uncertainty about the prospect.</i>

629
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:36,542
<i>It could prove to be</i>
<i>a scientific triumph</i>

630
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:38,125
<i>or a catastrophe.</i>

631
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,917
Commander,
the Brechtian Cluster

632
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:43,083
is now five
light years away.

633
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,750
Are we still picking up
the entity's pattern?
Yes, Commander.

634
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,583
But sensors have not yet locked
on to it's exact whereabouts.

635
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:50,166
Captain, we are
reasonably sure

636
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,375
it's between here
and the Brechtian Cluster.

637
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:54,709
If I start emitting
the graviton beam now,

638
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:57,750
it may serve as a lure,
a kind of beacon.

639
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,834
Make it so.

640
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:03,125
We'll start with a pulse width
of five nanoseconds--

641
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,375
frequency,
one pulse per second.

642
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:08,959
Commencing graviton
emissions... now.

643
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:15,000
No change
in sensor readings.

644
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,583
Let's ramp the frequency.

645
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:20,625
Emissions now at
ten pulses per second.

646
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:24,166
Sir.

647
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,375
What is it?

648
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,709
Do you have something?

649
00:38:27,709 --> 00:38:31,542
A large mass
approaching at warp speed.

650
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:32,917
Full stop.
ENSIGN: Aye, sir.

651
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:34,750
Doctor, continue
emitting the signals.

652
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,542
Mr. Worf, on screen.

653
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:46,458
Shields up.

654
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:50,542
PICARD:
Magnify.

655
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,375
It's beautiful.

656
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,875
What's it doing?
Checking us out?

657
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,083
Possibly.

658
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,291
Just as we're
checking it out.

659
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:04,000
Dr. Marr, do you wish
to change the frequency?

660
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:08,291
Dr. Marr?

661
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:11,291
Yes, yes,
proceed, Commander.

662
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,917
Changing to 20 pulses
per second.

663
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:20,417
Is it responding
to us?

664
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:21,834
MARR:
Let's test that.

665
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:25,291
Ramp the frequency again,
Commander.

666
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:28,458
Emissions now at
30 pulses per second.

667
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:31,041
Captain, I'm reading
a transmission from the entity--

668
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:33,000
a series of graviton pulses.

669
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,583
It's working.

670
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,417
That's a response
to our signal.

671
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,208
Remarkable.

672
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:44,834
Captain, there is a pattern
emerging from the signals.

673
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:51,875
It's trying
to communicate with us.

674
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,750
DATA:
I believe so, sir,

675
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,583
but it will take some time
to decipher the patterns.

676
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Then it's possible--

677
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,667
communication,
understanding.

678
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,125
Let me try something else.

679
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:10,333
A continuous graviton beam.

680
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:19,375
All graviton pulses
from the entity have stopped.

681
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,750
Maybe it doesn't like
what we're doing.

682
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,875
Doctor, return to
the intermittent signal.

683
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,917
Doctor?
Dr. Marr?

684
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:41,917
Dr. Marr, we must return
to the intermittent signal.

685
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:43,709
Counselor?

686
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:45,625
Something's very wrong,
Captain.

687
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:48,625
The entity is
beginning to resonate.

688
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:50,458
Vibrations
are increasing.

689
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:52,250
Dr. Marr,
stop the transmission.

690
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,125
That is an order.

691
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,875
Dr. Marr,
do you hear me?

692
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,750
It's for you, Renny.

693
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,750
I did it for you.

694
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,709
Mr. Data, shut down
the transmission.

695
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,959
Vibration amplitude
is increasing.

696
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:07,583
It can't last much longer.

697
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:10,291
I cannot stop
the graviton signal, Captain.

698
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:12,875
Dr. Marr has isolated
the access code.

699
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,917
Maybe I can create
an override sequence.

700
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:16,625
Shut it down from here.

701
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:19,333
DATA: The amplitude is
still rising, Captain.

702
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,750
Resonance is
approaching critical.

703
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,166
I can override her program, but
it's going to take some time.

704
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:44,917
Mr. Worf, will you escort
the Doctor to her quarters?

705
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:47,625
Yes, sir.

706
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,834
It will never hurt
anyone again.

707
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:53,417
Perhaps I should escort
the Doctor, sir.

708
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:56,875
Fine, but don't
leave her unattended.

709
00:41:56,875 --> 00:41:59,667
Please come with me,
Doctor.

710
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,667
Of course.

711
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:25,208
I will stay
with you, Doctor.

712
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:36,667
How long will you live, Data?

713
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:38,458
There has been
no predetermined limit

714
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,291
placed on my existence,
Doctor.

715
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,834
I'm glad.

716
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:45,083
As long as you're alive,

717
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:47,458
he'll be alive.

718
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,875
I need your help, Data.

719
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:56,959
In what way, Doctor?

720
00:42:56,959 --> 00:42:59,166
Like you did before.

721
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:01,333
Tell me...

722
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:04,542
that you understand,
Renny.

723
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:06,333
Yes.

724
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,375
That... that you know
I did it for you.

725
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:12,208
'Cause I love you.

726
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:17,458
Because I wanted to
give you peace at last.

727
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:20,291
I do not find such a file

728
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:22,750
in your son's journals,
Doctor.

729
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,750
However, from what
I know of him,

730
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,583
by his memories
and his writing,

731
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:31,500
I do not believe
he would be happy.

732
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,500
He was proud of your career
as a scientist,

733
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,333
and now you
have destroyed that.

734
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:39,917
You say
you did it for him,

735
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,792
but I do not believe
he would have wanted that.

736
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,750
Yes...

737
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,458
I believe your son
would be very sad now.

738
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:53,333
I am sorry, Doctor,
but I cannot help you.
