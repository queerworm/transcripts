00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 45854.2.</i>

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:07,333
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> is charting</i>
<i>six star systems</i>

3
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:09,583
<i>that make up</i>
<i>the Argolis Cluster--</i>

4
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:14,709
<i>an area being considered</i>
<i>for colonization.</i>

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,458
Very impressive.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,667
It's beautiful...

7
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:20,834
but frightening
at the same time.

8
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:21,959
DATA:
Captain

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,333
I am detecting a transmission

10
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,291
emanating
from within the system.

11
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,667
What sort of signal?

12
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,417
It is self-repeating,
of unknown pattern.

13
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,750
Where is it coming from?

14
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:34,750
A small moon
orbiting the
fourth planet.

15
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:35,750
Life signs?

16
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:37,291
Indeterminate.

17
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,750
I am attempting to screen out
sensor interference.

18
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,125
Readings are still inconclusive.

19
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,583
However, the moon's atmosphere

20
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,208
is capable of
supporting life.

21
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,917
It could be a distress call.

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,667
Helm, take us
into transport range.

23
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:54,875
Dr. Crusher, meet me
in Transporter Room Two

24
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:56,125
with a medical away team.

25
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,500
CRUSHER:
Acknowledged.

26
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,500
I'm reading one life-form,
very weak signs.

27
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:26,625
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

28
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:30,959
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,542
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

30
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:36,333
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds</i>

31
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:40,917
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations</i>

32
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,166
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

33
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,917
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

34
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,667
PICARD:
Go ahead, Number One.

35
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,959
We found the wreckage
of a small craft.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,208
One survivor.

37
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,417
It's a Borg.

38
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,834
Male, adolescent.
He's badly hurt.

39
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,458
DATA:
Sir, there is
no indication

40
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,125
of other Borg activity
within sensor range.

41
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,875
Away team,
prepare to return to the ship.

42
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,417
CRUSHER:
Captain we can't
leave him here.

43
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,333
He won't survive.

44
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,250
I think the Captain
understands that.

45
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,458
I don't.

46
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,208
The Borg
usually collect their dead.

47
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,375
He's not dead.

48
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:13,458
RIKER:
The transmission...

49
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,667
At least not yet.

50
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,041
The transmission
that we intercepted

51
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,709
was probably
a homing signal.

52
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,166
We have to assume
they're on their way.

53
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,834
Let me at least
stabilize his condition--

54
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,250
give him a chance of surviving
until they get here.

55
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,709
Your concern is noted,
Doctor

56
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,375
but any intervention
on our part

57
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:30,041
would alert the Borg
to our having been there.

58
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,250
I'm afraid we've turned
that corner already.

59
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,166
Kill it now.

60
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,333
Make it appear
that it died in the crash.

61
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:42,208
Leave no evidence
that we were ever here.

62
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,000
Security measures must be taken
before we beam it on board.

63
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,041
CRUSHER:
Thank you, Captain.

64
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,250
Standing by.

65
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,583
Mr. Data, notify security

66
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,583
to prepare
a detention cell.

67
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,750
Bridge
to Engineering.

68
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,083
La Forge here.

69
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,875
We're bringing
a Borg survivor on board.

70
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:56,750
We'll need to neutralize
the homing signal.

71
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,834
Prevent it from sending
or receiving transmissions

72
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,291
of any kind.

73
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,750
I'll set up a subspace
dampening field

74
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,166
around the detention cell.

75
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,458
Very well.

76
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:31,542
There are four more.

77
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,834
None survived.

78
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:33,750
Picard to Riker.

79
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,333
Go ahead,<i> Enterprise.</i>

80
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,834
We are transporting you directly
to the detention cell.

81
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,667
CRUSHER:
I need him in Sick Bay, Captain.

82
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,000
The cell, Doctor.

83
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,083
Whatever equipment you need

84
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,750
will be brought to you there.

85
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,000
Very well.

86
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,125
(<i> door chimes</i> )

87
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,417
Come.

88
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:07,917
Captain,
I was wondering

89
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,667
if there was anything
you wanted to talk about.

90
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:13,041
I don't think
so, Counselor.

91
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,792
I would have thought
having a Borg on the ship

92
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,291
would stir some feelings.

93
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:21,375
I'm quite recovered
from my experience, thank you.

94
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:25,834
Sometimes, even when a victim
has dealt with his assault

95
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:29,875
there are residual effects
of the event that linger.

96
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:32,417
You were treated violently
by the Borg--

97
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,375
kidnapped, assaulted,
mutilated...

98
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:37,625
Counselor...

99
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,792
Counselor, I very much
appreciate your concern for me

100
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,834
but I can assure you,
it is quite misplaced.

101
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,375
I have carefully
considered the
implications

102
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,458
of having a Borg
on this ship.

103
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,583
I have weighed
the possible risks

104
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:53,333
and I'm convinced that
we are doing the right thing.

105
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:58,333
Now, I am quite comfortable
with my decision.

106
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,709
I see.

107
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,375
Well, if at any point
you want to talk more...

108
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:06,583
I shall certainly avail myself
of your help.

109
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,792
WORF:
Lower the force field.

110
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:31,542
Captain, the Borg
is still unconscious.

111
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,417
CRUSHER:
He suffered massive
internal injuries.

112
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,959
We've been able
to control the hemorrhaging

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,917
but some of the implants
in his brain were damaged.

114
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,041
I may have to
remove them.

115
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,041
The Borg will die
if they're removed permanently.

116
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,583
Their brains grow dependent
on the biochips.

117
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,166
Perhaps Geordi can construct
some new implants.

118
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,583
They contain relatively
straightforward programming--

119
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,875
interface protocols.

120
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,208
We have the files
we downloaded

121
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,875
after your
experience, Captain.

122
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:57,250
I think I can manage it.

123
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,583
Mr. La Forge...

124
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,750
Do you know enough
about Borg programming

125
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:07,792
to alter the pathways
to their root command structure?

126
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,583
I'm not sure, sir.

127
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,291
Subroutines are
pretty complicated.

128
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,125
I'd probably have to study
the data processing algorithms.

129
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,792
It's the only way
I could trace the access codes.

130
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:19,792
If we could get
to the root command

131
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,542
we could introduce
an invasive programming sequence

132
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,583
through its biochip system

133
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,291
and then return it
to the hive.

134
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,208
The Borg are so interconnected,
it would act like a virus.

135
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,834
Which would infect
the entire collective.

136
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,750
We could disable their
neural network at a stroke.

137
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,083
Infect it?

138
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,375
You make it sound
as if it's a disease.

139
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:43,917
Quite right, Doctor.

140
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,291
If all goes well,
a terminal one.

141
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,125
If this works the
way I think it will

142
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,792
once the invasive program
starts spreading

143
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,208
it'll only be a
matter of months

144
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,625
before the Borg suffer
total systems failure.

145
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,542
Comments?

146
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,917
CRUSHER:
A question.

147
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,917
What exactly
is total systems failure?

148
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,083
DATA:
The Borg are
extremely

149
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,333
computer-dependent.

150
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,625
A systems failure
will destroy them.

151
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,917
I just think
we should be clear about that.

152
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:16,500
We're talking about
annihilating an entire race.

153
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:17,667
PICARD:
Which under
most circumstances

154
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,250
would be unconscionable

155
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,917
but as I see it, the Borg
leave us with little choice.

156
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,667
I agree; we're at war.

157
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,834
There's been no formal
declaration of war.

158
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,542
Not from us,
but certainly from them.

159
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,458
They've attacked us
at every encounter.

160
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,166
They've declared war
on our way of life.

161
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,625
We're to be assimilated.

162
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,500
But even in war there are rules.

163
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,542
You don't kill civilians
indiscriminately.

164
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,542
There are no civilians
among the Borg.

165
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,625
Think of them
as a single collective being.

166
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,542
There's no one Borg
who is more an individual

167
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,375
than your arm or your leg.

168
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,834
How convenient.

169
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,041
PICARD:
Your point, Doctor?

170
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,291
When I look at my patient

171
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't see a collective
consciousness.

172
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,417
I don't see a hive.

173
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,834
I see a living, breathing boy

174
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,875
who has been hurt
and who needs our help

175
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:59,083
and we're talking about sending
him back to his people

176
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,125
as an instrument of destruction.

177
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,959
It comes down to this--

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,542
we're faced with an enemy
who are determined to destroy us

179
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,375
and we have no hope
of negotiating a peace.

180
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:11,333
Unless that changes,
we are justified in doing

181
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,667
anything we can to survive.

182
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:16,083
Security to Captain.

183
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,375
Picard here.

184
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,583
The Borg
has regained consciousness, sir.

185
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,166
Acknowledged.

186
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,709
We proceed with the plan.

187
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,083
What's he doing?

188
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,542
He's trying to find
an access terminal

189
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,250
so that he can interface
with the collective.

190
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,375
He doesn't understand that
the signal has been cut off.

191
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:43,667
He's emitting
a homing signal

192
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,000
and a second
subspace beacon

193
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,917
but our dampening field
is blocking both signals.

194
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,000
He's alone.

195
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,125
For the first time
he's being forced to cope

196
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,834
with his environment
without the resources

197
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,542
of the collective.

198
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,166
He must be hungry.

199
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,041
The Borg don't ingest food.

200
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,792
Their implants can synthesize
any organic molecules

201
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:12,750
their biological tissues
require.

202
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:14,333
What they need

203
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,875
is energy.

204
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,542
Arrange to feed it.

205
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,709
Aye, sir.

206
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,083
DATA:
I'll have to adapt
a power conduit

207
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,917
and install it in there.

208
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:37,000
If I didn't know better,
I'd think he was scared.

209
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,583
(<i> beeping</i> )

210
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't think I like this sport.

211
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,500
Last week when you scored
two touches

212
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,250
you liked it well enough.

213
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,542
Today, you were
dropping your foil.

214
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,083
You kept letting me inside.

215
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,959
Ah, but if I lift up

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,917
you lunge right
underneath.

217
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,166
Let's face it--

218
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,417
you're much better
at this than I am.

219
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:23,083
I understand we have
a guest on board.

220
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,625
Yes.

221
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,083
Is that wise?

222
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,166
I'm not sure.
I hope so.

223
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,750
I thought I understood you,
Picard

224
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,625
but I don't understand this.

225
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:34,792
It was an errand of mercy.

226
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,500
He was injured.

227
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,959
Dr. Crusher decided
for humanitarian reasons

228
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,333
to care for him.

229
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,625
They're going to come after us,
you know that.

230
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:48,250
You of all people
know that.

231
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,667
Shall we go again?

232
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,542
(<i> sighs</i> )

233
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,083
(<i> gasps in pain</i> )

234
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,750
Are you all right?

235
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,291
(<i> beeping</i> )

236
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:25,208
You felt sorry for me.

237
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,875
Look what it got you.

238
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:46,083
I'll have to go in
to connect the power conduit.

239
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,834
I will follow
the Commander.

240
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,458
Reactivate the field
once we're through.

241
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,875
Good. Now,
stay that way.

242
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,083
Commander!

243
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:39,333
We are Borg.

244
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,417
You will be
assimilated.

245
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,458
Resistance
is futile.

246
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,959
Just look around, pal.

247
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,875
You're hardly in a position
to make any demands.

248
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:53,333
We must return
to the collective.

249
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,583
Who's we?

250
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,125
We... are Borg.

251
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,792
Yeah,
but there's only one of you.

252
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,959
Do you have a name?

253
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,500
A means of identification?

254
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:19,500
Third of Five.

255
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:22,250
There were five on your ship.

256
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,458
Is that it?
Just a number?

257
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,291
Third of Five.

258
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,250
It does kind of suit you.

259
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,000
Okay.

260
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,542
This is for you.

261
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,083
It regulates the power flow
to the frequency

262
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,667
that you're used to.

263
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,834
This connection should fit
that coupling on your arm.

264
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,375
You're welcome.

265
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,625
Let's get out of here.

266
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,250
Lower the force field.

267
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:35,166
He's hungry, all right.

268
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,750
Why do you do this?

269
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:41,333
I'm just a nice guy at heart.

270
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,333
You feeling better?

271
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,458
You are not Borg.

272
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,625
That's right,
and I hope to stay that way.

273
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:51,959
You will be assimilated.

274
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,083
Resistance
is futile.

275
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,500
That's gratitude for you.

276
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,000
I've been rationing
his portions of energy.

277
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,583
I think he understands.

278
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,917
When he cooperates, he gets fed.

279
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,291
If not...

280
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:16,542
Like a rat in a cage.

281
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,959
Look, if I'm going to figure out
his command pathways

282
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,291
I need to learn
how he processes information

283
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,083
and the only way I know
how to do that

284
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,041
is by giving him
perceptual tests.

285
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,834
And for that
I need his cooperation.

286
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,417
So he can participate
in the destruction

287
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,875
of his entire species.

288
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:32,875
Doctor...

289
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,083
I know, I know.

290
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,125
We're at war.

291
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,917
I'm here to help,
but I don't have to like it.

292
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,083
Okay, I think we're ready
to transport him.

293
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,625
If he gives us any trouble

294
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:48,125
we can access the force field
through that console.

295
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,625
You ready?

296
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,750
La Forge
to Transporter Room Three.

297
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,125
We're ready here.

298
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,875
We're standing by, Commander.

299
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,333
Energize.

300
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,291
Third of Five,
this is Dr. Crusher.

301
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:26,083
Dr. Crusher,
this is Third of Five.

302
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,083
Hello.

303
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,166
What is a doctor?

304
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,166
A doctor
heals the sick

305
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,834
and repairs
the injured.

306
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,917
The sick and injured
are reabsorbed.

307
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:40,458
Others take
their place.

308
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,000
That isn't
what happened to you.

309
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,291
When we found you,
you were dying.

310
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,417
I saved your life.

311
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,792
Why?

312
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,875
It's my duty
to help those who are hurt.

313
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,709
You give us food.

314
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,959
Yeah.

315
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Is that your duty?

316
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,792
Yeah, that's right.

317
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:02,959
Listen, Third of Five

318
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,375
Dr. Crusher here
has repaired

319
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,709
a lot of the damage to
your biochip implants.

320
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,041
We want to run
a few tests--

321
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,291
make sure everything's
working okay.

322
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,834
Tests?

323
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,083
I'd like to show you
a few diagrams

324
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,625
and ask you some questions
about them.

325
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,375
It's very simple, really.

326
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:18,917
You will be assimilated.

327
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,875
Yes, but before that happens

328
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,458
could we ask you
a few questions?

329
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,792
We will answer.

330
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:28,917
Terrific.

331
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,125
All right, hang on

332
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,583
just a second here,
Third of Five.

333
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,417
What is your designation?

334
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,083
Designation?

335
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,166
Third of Five.

336
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,208
You mean our names.

337
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,000
We don't have designations.

338
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,750
We have names.

339
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,333
I'm Beverly.

340
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,041
This is Geordi.

341
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,792
Do I have a name?

342
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,667
Do you want one?

343
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:53,041
A name.

344
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:57,625
I'm Beverly,
he's Geordi, and you...

345
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:58,625
You.

346
00:19:58,667 --> 00:19:59,625
You...

347
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,709
No, wait a minute.

348
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,166
That's it.

349
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,917
Hugh.

350
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,959
What do you think?

351
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You.

352
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,792
No, not "you"--

353
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,041
"Hugh."

354
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,000
Hugh.

355
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,250
Okay, now...

356
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,375
I'm Beverly.

357
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm Geordi.

358
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,583
We are Hugh.

359
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,750
(<i> both chuckle softly</i> )

360
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,083
Now imagine what this shape
would look like

361
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,208
if it were turned
inside out.

362
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,166
Which one is it?

363
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,041
This one.

364
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,583
That's right.

365
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,166
He's gotten every one.

366
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,291
Eight out of eight.

367
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,500
That blows the top
right off

368
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,542
of the spatial acuity
percentiles.

369
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,208
It's the prosthetic eye.

370
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,959
It seems to be giving him
very complex

371
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,875
visual information.

372
00:20:58,917 --> 00:20:59,834
Like some kind of

373
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,291
holographic imaging system.

374
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,834
That could be helpful.

375
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:08,083
Hugh, I'd like to take
a closer look at your eyepiece.

376
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,500
Is that okay?

377
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,458
Here.

378
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,166
Thanks.

379
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,542
When you are
assimilated

380
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,959
you will have a
similar device.

381
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,583
Hugh, do you understand?

382
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,125
We don't want
to be assimilated.

383
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,166
Why do you
resist us?

384
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:32,000
Because we don't want to live
the way you do.

385
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,291
Here it is quiet.

386
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,834
There are no other voices.

387
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,750
Other voices?

388
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,375
On a Borg ship

389
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:43,917
we live with the thoughts
of the others in our minds.

390
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:48,792
Thousands of voices
with us always.

391
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:54,250
I think what you're saying
is that you're lonely.

392
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,083
Here.

393
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:03,333
When you have
completed these tests

394
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,250
what will be
done with us?

395
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:13,083
We'll, um...

396
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,750
we'll send you home.

397
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,875
We will rejoin the collective.

398
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,625
You know, it's funny.

399
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:30,875
When I first started creating
this invasive program

400
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,834
I didn't have a problem
with it.

401
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,667
The more I work
with Hugh, the more...

402
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:38,500
Uh... Hugh?

403
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:41,834
That's what
we call him.

404
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,333
You named the Borg?

405
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:46,208
Well, it was easier
having something to call him.

406
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,750
Oh, so now you have a Borg
named Hugh.

407
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:53,250
Right, and he's nothing
like what I expected.

408
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,250
How so?

409
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,291
I don't know.

410
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,750
It's...

411
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

412
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,917
It's like he's just some kid

413
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:03,417
who's far away
from home.

414
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,792
Do you know that you are
the second person today

415
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,125
to refer to that Borg

416
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:11,041
as though it were
some sort of lost child?

417
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,166
Anyway, I'm having
second thoughts

418
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,750
about what we're doing here--

419
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,709
I mean, programming him
like some sort of walking bomb.

420
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,709
Sending him back to
destroy the others.

421
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,458
Let me tell you something.

422
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,166
When that "kid's" big brothers
come looking for him

423
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,333
they're not going to stop
till they find him

424
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,583
and then they're going
to come looking for us

425
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,000
and they will destroy us

426
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,792
and they will not do
any of the soul-searching

427
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,959
that you are apparently
doing right now.

428
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,917
Then why don't you
go and talk to him?

429
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,834
It might not be
so clear-cut then.

430
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,917
Because I wouldn't have
anything to say.

431
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,166
(<i> sighs</i> )

432
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,959
Then why don't you just listen?

433
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,083
That is what you do best,
isn't it?

434
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,000
What is it,
Number One?

435
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,542
We've picked up a vessel
on the long-range scanners

436
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,917
headed this way.

437
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,542
Analysis?

438
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,375
The vessel
is traveling at warp 7.6.

439
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:22,458
Mass: 2.5 million metric tons.

440
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,166
Configuration: cubical.

441
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,083
The Borg.

442
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,208
DATA:
Its dimensions indicate
that it is a scout ship

443
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,166
similar to the one that crashed.

444
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,083
Interference from
the star's radiation

445
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,000
will shield us
from their sensors.

446
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,667
We should remain undetected
until they enter the system.

447
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:41,250
How long do we have?

448
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,542
At present speed

449
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,375
they will arrive
in 31 hours, seven minutes.

450
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,250
You don't look so tough.

451
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:10,000
We are Borg.

452
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:15,000
Aren't you going to tell me
you have to assimilate me?

453
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,875
You wish to be assimilated?

454
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:19,458
No, but that's what you...

455
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,333
things do, isn't it?

456
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,500
"Resistance is futile"?

457
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:28,583
Resistance is futile.

458
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:34,125
It isn't.

459
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:37,041
My people resisted
when the Borg came

460
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:40,083
to assimilate us.

461
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:42,750
Some of us survived.

462
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:46,166
Resistance is not futile?

463
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,625
No.

464
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:53,375
But thanks to you,
there are very few of us left.

465
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:57,792
We are scattered
throughout the galaxy.

466
00:25:57,834 --> 00:25:59,959
We don't even have
a home anymore.

467
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,667
What you are saying
is that you are lonely.

468
00:26:07,709 --> 00:26:09,250
What?

469
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,959
You have no others.

470
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,834
You have no home.

471
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:20,041
We are also lonely.

472
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:38,625
HUGH:
What is Geordi doing?

473
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:43,625
I'm studying the
components in
your prosthesis.

474
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,792
Why?

475
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:49,291
I'm trying to learn
more about you.

476
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,917
Why?

477
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:55,834
Because you're different
than we are.

478
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:59,834
Part of what we do is learn
more about other species.

479
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,542
We assimilate species.

480
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:04,542
Then we know
everything about them.

481
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,625
Yeah. I know.

482
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:17,250
Is that not easier?

483
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:18,333
Maybe it is.

484
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:21,083
It's just not what we do.

485
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:24,291
Why?

486
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,333
All right.

487
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,125
Think of it this way.

488
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,250
Every time
you talk about yourself

489
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:31,583
you use the word "we."

490
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,250
<i>We</i> want this.<i> We</i> want that.

491
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,083
You don't even know
how to think of yourself

492
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,583
as a single individual.

493
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:42,417
You don't say,
<i>"I</i> want this" or<i> "I</i> am Hugh."

494
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:46,792
<i>We</i> are all
separate individuals.

495
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,792
<i>I</i> am Geordi.

496
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,875
<i>I</i> choose what I want
to do with my life.

497
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:53,959
<i>I</i> make decisions for myself.

498
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,125
For somebody like me

499
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:57,083
losing that sense
of individuality

500
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,166
is almost worse than dying.

501
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:05,083
When you sleep, there are
no other voices in your mind?

502
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,542
No.

503
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:13,709
Are you ever... lonely?

504
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,542
Sometimes.

505
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:19,083
But that's why we have friends.

506
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,041
Friends?

507
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,166
Sure.

508
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:22,667
Someone you can talk to

509
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:25,583
who will be with you
when you're lonely.

510
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,417
Someone...

511
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:28,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

512
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:30,750
someone
who makes you feel better.

513
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:36,333
Like Geordi... and Hugh.

514
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:42,291
That's it, Captain.

515
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:43,834
Looks harmless enough.

516
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,458
Well, we had to disguise it
as something innocuous.

517
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,542
The Borg have ways of screening
out program anomalies.

518
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:51,834
How can a geometric form
disable a computer system?

519
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,500
The shape is a paradox, sir.

520
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:56,333
It cannot exist
in real time or space.

521
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:59,834
When Hugh's imaging apparatus
imprints this on his biochips

522
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,125
he'll try to analyze it.

523
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,750
DATA:
He will be
unsuccessful

524
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:05,291
and will store the shape
in his memory banks.

525
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,083
It will be shunted to a
subroutine for further analysis.

526
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,208
And when the Borg
download his memory

527
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,000
it'll be incorporated
into their network

528
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,000
then they'll try to analyze it.

529
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,041
DATA:
It is designed
so that each step

530
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,041
they take will spawn
an anomalous solution.

531
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,458
The anomalies are designed
to interact with each other

532
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,250
linking together
to form an endless

533
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,333
and unsolvable puzzle.

534
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:26,000
Quite original.

535
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,041
How long
before a total systems failure?

536
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,333
Not until the shape
has gone through

537
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,792
several hundred
computational cycles.

538
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:33,208
When can you begin the process?

539
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,500
In about another 20 hours.

540
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:35,834
Dr. Crusher
wants to make sure

541
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,333
that the new implants
have taken hold.

542
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,792
Very well.

543
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:41,709
Begin as soon
as you're ready.

544
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,333
Captain...

545
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,375
I have to admit I've been
having second thoughts

546
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:49,041
about this plan.

547
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,208
In what way?

548
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,500
Well... I've been
getting to know him.

549
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,000
The Borg.

550
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,333
I see.

551
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:01,291
He's not what I expected,
Captain.

552
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,166
He's got feelings.

553
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,875
He's homesick.

554
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,166
I don't know.

555
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,834
It just doesn't seem right
using him this way.

556
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,792
Centuries ago, when
laboratory animals

557
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:15,166
were used for experiments,
scientists would sometimes

558
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,625
become attached
to the creatures.

559
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:18,959
This would be a problem

560
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,458
if the experiment
involved killing them.

561
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,458
I would suggest that you
un-attach yourself

562
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,542
from the Borg, Mr. La Forge.

563
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:31,750
Aye, sir.

564
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,208
(<i> door chimes</i> )

565
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:45,166
Guinan.

566
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:46,750
Please, come in.

567
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:47,875
Are you sure?

568
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:49,375
You look like
you're preparing

569
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:50,750
for a quiet evening.

570
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:52,333
No, I'm delighted to see you.

571
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:53,750
Can I get you something
to drink?

572
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:56,458
No, thank you.

573
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,125
I was thinking
how you said the other day

574
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:01,208
that my foil was dipping.

575
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,834
That I should get some exercise
and strengthen my arm.

576
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,125
Well, a strong forearm

577
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:10,041
is certainly an advantage
in fencing.

578
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:13,291
And bartending.

579
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:16,375
About the Borg.

580
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,542
Aren't you the least
bit surprised by him?

581
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:20,917
Surprised?

582
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:22,667
You know he
has a name?

583
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:25,000
La Forge gave it to him.

584
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:27,000
His name is Hugh

585
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,458
and he's lonely.

586
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,458
I don't know what
made me go see him.

587
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,333
La Forge said I should,
but I said no.

588
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:39,583
Then suddenly, there I was,
standing there staring at him.

589
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:42,417
I thought it was just curiosity.

590
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,417
Just curious.

591
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,375
I need to hear you say
that you are<i> sure</i>

592
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:57,083
you are doing the right thing.

593
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,542
If you are here
to persuade me

594
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,625
not to use
the invasive program...

595
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:01,792
No.

596
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:04,667
I think I need you
to persuade me.

597
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,291
Two days ago, you were so upset

598
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:07,875
about the Borg
even being on the ship

599
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:11,500
that you tore my foil
out of my hand.

600
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:14,000
And now you're here questioning

601
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:16,291
whether it should be treated
as the enemy.

602
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,625
I know

603
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:19,166
but when you talk to him
face-to-face

604
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:21,959
can you honestly say
you don't have any doubt?

605
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,333
I haven't talked to it.

606
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,041
Why not?

607
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,500
I saw no need.

608
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:28,166
If you're going
to use this person...

609
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,375
It's not a person, damn it!

610
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:31,667
It's a Borg.

611
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:36,458
If you are going to use
this person to destroy his race

612
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,917
you should at least
look him in the eye once

613
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,875
before you do it

614
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:46,333
because I am not sure
he is still a Borg.

615
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,959
Because it's been given a name
by a member of my crew

616
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,625
doesn't mean it's not a Borg.

617
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:53,834
Because it's young,
doesn't mean that it's innocent.

618
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,709
It is what it is

619
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,583
and in spite of efforts
to turn it into some kind of<i> pet</i>

620
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,250
I will not alter my plans.

621
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:06,542
Fine.

622
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:09,250
But if you don't talk to him
at least once

623
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,667
you may find that decision

624
00:33:10,709 --> 00:33:12,917
a lot harder to live with
than you realize.

625
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,291
Worf to Captain Picard.

626
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:28,625
Yes, Lieutenant.

627
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,625
We are ready to transport.

628
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,875
Proceed.

629
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,041
Lieutenant,
you may wait outside.

630
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:02,291
Locutus.

631
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:09,917
Yes.

632
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:14,542
I am Locutus of Borg.

633
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,250
Why are you here?

634
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,417
This is a primitive culture.

635
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:26,417
I am here to facilitate
its incorporation.

636
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:29,166
Identify yourself.

637
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:31,375
Hugh.

638
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:32,917
Identify yourself.

639
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,667
We are Hugh.

640
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,166
This is not
a Borg identification.

641
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:46,083
Third of Five.

642
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,041
This culture
will be assimilated.

643
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,125
They do not wish it.

644
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,667
Irrelevant.

645
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:57,125
They will resist us.

646
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:59,000
Resistance is futile.

647
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:06,917
Resistance is not futile.

648
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,792
Some have escaped.

649
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:10,417
They will be found.

650
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:13,000
It is inevitable.

651
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,667
All will be assimilated.

652
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,709
Must Geordi be assimilated?

653
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,458
Yes.

654
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,959
He does not wish it.

655
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:33,000
He would rather die
than be assimilated.

656
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,792
Then he will die.

657
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:39,583
No.

658
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:42,875
Geordi must not die.

659
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,208
Geordi is a friend.

660
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,625
You will assist us
to assimilate this vessel.

661
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:54,333
You are Borg.

662
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:57,291
You will assist us.

663
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,625
I will not.

664
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,375
What did you say?

665
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:06,208
I will not assist you.

666
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,750
I?

667
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:11,041
Geordi must not be assimilated.

668
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:12,583
But you are Borg.

669
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,417
No.

670
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,041
I am Hugh.

671
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:31,291
I think that I deliberately
avoided meeting with the Borg

672
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:35,417
because I didn't want anything
to get in the way of our plan.

673
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:38,917
But now that I have...

674
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:44,500
he seems to be
a fully realized...

675
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:46,208
<i>individual.</i>

676
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,166
He's even accepted me
as Picard

677
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,083
Captain
of this ship

678
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,375
and not
as Locutus.

679
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,959
So, you've reconsidered
the plan?

680
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,542
Yes. To use him in this manner,
we'd be no better

681
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:59,125
than the enemy
that we seek to destroy.

682
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,834
So, I want other options.

683
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:05,917
RIKER:
We could return him
to the crash site.

684
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:07,166
We'd have to remove his memory

685
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,959
of having been
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

686
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,917
But if we erase
his memory

687
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:13,583
who he is or who he has become
would be destroyed.

688
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:14,917
Isn't that the point?

689
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,208
He'd be reassimilated
back into the hive

690
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,208
without any questions.

691
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,375
Does that seem right--

692
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:19,625
to help him become
an individual

693
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,834
and then take that
away from him?

694
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:22,875
Is there any danger

695
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,041
that the Borg
might destroy him

696
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,625
if they find out
what's happened?

697
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:26,709
PICARD:
I doubt it.

698
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,208
There'd be nothing to gain.

699
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,792
It's more likely that
they would simply wipe out

700
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,792
his memory of those experiences.

701
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,875
Then either way, his memory
would have been erased.

702
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:36,750
But perhaps...

703
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:39,458
in that short time
before they purge his memory...

704
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:46,959
the sense of individuality
which he has gained with us

705
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,333
might be transmitted through
the entire Borg collective.

706
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,041
Every one of the Borg
being given the opportunity

707
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:58,917
to experience the feeling
of... of singularity.

708
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:07,458
And perhaps that's the most
pernicious program of all--

709
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,667
the knowledge of self
being spread

710
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:16,125
throughout the collective
in that brief moment

711
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,959
might alter them forever.

712
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:25,000
We leave his memory intact.

713
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:27,792
I have a question.

714
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:29,875
What if he doesn't want
to go back?

715
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:44,750
Hello, Hugh.

716
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:46,750
Hello, Geordi.

717
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,875
Hugh, a Borg rescue vessel
is approaching.

718
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:52,500
It will be here
within three hours.

719
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:54,667
We can return you
to the crash site

720
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:58,792
where they will find you
and then take you home

721
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:02,750
or if you wish,
you can stay here with us.

722
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:05,959
What I wish is irrelevant.

723
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,333
It's not irrelevant, Hugh.

724
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,792
It matters to us.

725
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:10,792
No Borg

726
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:12,500
leaves the collective.

727
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:15,792
If they find I am missing,
they will come for me.

728
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:18,583
Well, we'll deal with
the repercussions later.

729
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:21,458
We must know what<i> you</i> want.

730
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,750
You are many.

731
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:24,542
I am one.

732
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,667
What I want is not important.

733
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:29,709
Don't you understand, Hugh?

734
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,583
We're giving you a choice.

735
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:35,208
Choice...

736
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,959
Yes, a choice.

737
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,458
Do you want to go back
with the Borg

738
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,542
or stay with us?

739
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,458
I could stay with you?

740
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,458
We could grant you asylum, Hugh.

741
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:54,458
Choose what I want.

742
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:02,417
I would choose
to stay with Geordi.

743
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:10,000
But it is too dangerous.

744
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,166
They will follow.

745
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:18,250
Return me to the crash site.

746
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,542
It is the only way.

747
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:23,500
Hugh, think about this.

748
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:27,792
Are you sure?

749
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,125
Yes.

750
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:45,667
The Borg ship will
enter orbit in one hour.

751
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:49,000
You'll soon
be headed home.

752
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:50,709
We'll beam him down and then
we'll take up a position

753
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,500
in the star's chromosphere.

754
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:53,542
The interference

755
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,250
will hide us
from their sensors.

756
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:59,083
Good-bye, Hugh.

757
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,166
It was nice
getting to know you.

758
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,875
Good-bye, Beverly.

759
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:05,583
You saved my life.

760
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:08,542
Hugh, it's not too late
to change your mind.

761
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:13,500
I must return.

762
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:19,083
Captain, I'd like
to go down with him.

763
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:21,166
My experience suggests
that they would ignore him.

764
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:22,709
Would you agree?

765
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,250
The Borg assimilate
civilizations, not individuals.

766
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,333
But, Captain,
they kidnapped<i> you.</i>

767
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:31,125
Because they needed a liaison
to communicate with humans.

768
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:32,959
They ignored every away team
we sent to their ship

769
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,625
including yours, Doctor.

770
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:36,125
You may accompany him.

771
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,875
Good-bye.

772
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:50,875
Captain, I do not want to forget
that I am Hugh.

773
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:56,625
Energize.

774
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:17,333
We found you there,
in the middle of that debris.

775
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,333
Then that is
where I will wait.

776
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:32,834
We are now
entering position.

777
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:34,583
Radiation levels
are rising.

778
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,792
Increase power
to the shields.

779
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:38,083
Hold us here.

780
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:40,041
Status of the Borg ship?

781
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:43,041
Solar radiation is rendering
our sensors inoperable.

782
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:45,083
At last known course and speed

783
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,542
the Borg vessel should enter
the system in three minutes.

784
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:54,208
Well, I guess
this is it, huh?

785
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:58,375
So long, Hugh.

786
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:00,875
Good-bye, Geordi.

787
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:02,959
I will try
to remember you.
