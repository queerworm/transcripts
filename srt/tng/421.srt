00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:04,875
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44769.2.</i>

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:07,834
<i>For some weeks we have had</i>
<i>a Klingon exobiologist on board</i>

3
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:10,041
<i>as part of a scientific</i>
<i>exchange program.</i>

4
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,917
<i>Unfortunately, we suspect</i>
<i>that he was involved</i>

5
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:14,500
<i>in a security breach</i>

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,959
<i>and in the possible sabotage</i>
<i>of our warp drive.</i>

7
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:20,834
What were you doing accessing
the propulsion system files

8
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:22,583
on Stardate 44758?

9
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:23,917
I didn't.

10
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:27,625
Yes, you did, from
computer 12B9, Deck 36.

11
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,625
The computer logged in
your identification

12
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:30,709
from your
communicator.

13
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:32,333
It must be a mistake.

14
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,250
J'ddan, we have
confirmed reports

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,166
that schematic drawings
of our dilithium chamber

16
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,959
fell into Romulan hands
one week later.

17
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,667
I know nothing about it.

18
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:46,083
I suppose you know nothing about
the explosion that disabled

19
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,959
the warp drive approximately
at the same time?

20
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:49,875
No, I was not involved.

21
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,458
You accuse me
because I am Klingon.

22
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,625
Our chief of security
is Klingon.

23
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,166
That has nothing
to do with it.

24
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,208
Send me home then,
if you are so distrusting.

25
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,333
We've already contacted
the Klingon High Council.

26
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,291
You'll be returned home as soon
as we finish our investigation.

27
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,291
I have
nothing more to say.

28
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,709
Very well.

29
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:14,041
Worf, accompany the lieutenant
to his quarters.

30
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,083
What do you think?

31
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,000
It's hard to tell.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,458
He's very closed,
but he is hiding something.

33
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:39,291
On the Klingon home world,
your name is not mentioned.

34
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,792
It is as though
you never existed.

35
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,041
A terrible burden
for a warrior to bear--

36
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:50,542
to become nothing,
to be without honor,

37
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:53,083
without the chance
for glory.

38
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,959
I have friends--

39
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,917
powerful friends
on the home world.

40
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,750
I could talk to them.

41
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,041
They might help
to restore your name.

42
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:13,000
If you could just take me
to a shuttle craft.

43
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:19,583
It could be done

44
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,041
without anyone
knowing about it.

45
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,542
I don't know how
you transferred

46
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:29,125
secret information
to the Romulans,

47
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,250
but I will find out--
<i>Pahtak!</i>

48
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,041
And when we inform
the Klingon High Council,

49
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,667
they will put you
to a slow death.

50
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:18,208
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

51
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:22,834
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

52
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,333
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

53
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:28,041
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds...</i>

54
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,625
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

55
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:37,542
<i>to boldly go where</i>
<i>no one has gone before.</i>

56
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,250
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

57
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,500
<i>Retired Admiral</i>
<i>Norah Satie,</i>

58
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,208
<i>whose investigation exposed</i>
<i>the alien conspiracy</i>

59
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,500
<i>against Starfleet Command</i>
<i>three years ago</i>

60
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,625
<i>is arriving to assist</i>
<i>in our inquiry.</i>

61
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,041
Captain Picard.

62
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,208
Admiral Satie,

63
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,750
welcome aboard
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

64
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,709
Delighted to be here.

65
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,792
I managed to acquire
my former staff.

66
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:02,375
My aide,
Sabin Genestra from Betazed,

67
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,250
and my assistant,
Nellen Tore

68
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,667
from Delb Two.

69
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:08,291
This is my first officer,
Commander William Riker.

70
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,625
May I show you
to your quarters?

71
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,125
Captain,
if Starfleet Command

72
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,834
was so concerned
with your report

73
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:16,875
they brought me
out of retirement,

74
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,792
I think I should get
right to work.

75
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,291
Very well.

76
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,542
Commander Riker, will you
see to the Admiral's staff?

77
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:25,875
First, I'd like to inspect
the damage to your engine room.

78
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,500
Admiral Satie,
this is Commander Data,

79
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,917
Commander La Forge.

80
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:38,125
Admiral.

81
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,542
We still can't get
in there, Captain.

82
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,083
The radiation levels
are dropping,

83
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,125
but they're still too high
to raise the isolation door.

84
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,709
How much longer
will it be?

85
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:46,208
At the rate
the levels are decreasing,

86
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,125
we will gain entry
in 49 hours, Captain.

87
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,291
Maybe the Admiral
would like to see

88
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,834
the visual log
of the explosion?

89
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,417
Yes.

90
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,041
This was logged
four days ago

91
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,709
at 0300 hours.

92
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,542
At that point, the emergency
confinement field was activated,

93
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,500
and the isolation
doors came down.

94
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,166
No one was killed,
but I have two people

95
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,125
in Sick Bay from
radiation burns.

96
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,291
Have you been able
to make any assessments?

97
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,709
DATA:
A slow-motion study

98
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,375
of the explosion
suggests that

99
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,625
the articulation
frame collapsed.

100
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,417
The schematics
that were stolen

101
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:32,875
from the<i> Enterprise--</i>

102
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,583
I believe some involved
the articulation frame

103
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,166
of the dilithium
chamber.

104
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,125
That's one reason we tend
to suspect sabotage.

105
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,125
Other evidence lends credence
to that theory, Captain.

106
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,542
A review of the sensor
logs indicates that

107
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:48,333
every system's reading was
well within normal parameters

108
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,917
until 52 milliseconds
before the explosion.

109
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,333
We haven't
found anything

110
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,709
that suggests
there was a malfunction

111
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:54,959
anywhere
along the line.

112
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,375
Captain,

113
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,166
I think I'm going
to need a full briefing

114
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,542
before we go
any further.

115
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,792
By all means,
Admiral.

116
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,542
SATIE:
Commander Data,

117
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,125
La Forge,

118
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,458
I don't envy you
your job.

119
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,166
Good luck.

120
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,166
There are very
disturbing overtones

121
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,583
in the idea of a Klingon
providing information

122
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,125
to the Romulans.

123
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,750
Are you aware of any other
Klingon-Romulan connection

124
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,792
that Starfleet might have
encountered recently?

125
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:33,709
I don't believe...

126
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:37,333
what Starfleet Command
knows or doesn't know

127
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,083
is for me to reveal.

128
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:44,583
This ship has
encountered...

129
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,333
several incidents

130
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,333
which might suggest
a potential alliance

131
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,083
between those
two powers.

132
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,250
We're well aware
of that, Captain.

133
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,959
What we must
concentrate on

134
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,208
is the business
at hand.

135
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,375
(<i> chiming</i> )

136
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,583
Come.

137
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,291
Excuse me, Captain,
I did not know...

138
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, please,
Mr. Worf, come in.

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,458
I particularly want
my guest to meet you.

140
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,250
Admiral Satie, this is
my head of security,

141
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,917
Lieutenant Worf.

142
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:11,917
Captain, I have
been pursuing

143
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,959
the investigation
of Lieutenant J'ddan.

144
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,208
I believe I know how
he transferred information

145
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,458
off the<i> Enterprise.</i>

146
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,667
Well done,
Lieutenant.

147
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,458
This is J'ddan's.

148
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,375
A hypo-syringe
he uses to treat

149
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,792
his Ba'ltmasor
syndrome.

150
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:28,291
But this has been fitted
with an optical reader

151
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,625
specially modified
to read data

152
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,041
from Starfleet
isolinear chips.

153
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,959
He can extract digital
information from a computer,

154
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,500
encode it in the form
of amino acid sequences,

155
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,291
and transfer those sequences
into a fluid in the syringe.

156
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,125
Then he injects
someone.

157
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,166
Perhaps even without
their knowledge.

158
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,625
Or perhaps
with their knowledge.

159
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,041
The information would be
carried in their bloodstream

160
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,834
in the form of
inert proteins.

161
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:54,208
The body itself
becomes a conveyor

162
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,333
of top secret files.

163
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:02,458
Lieutenant Worf,
when we confront J'ddan,

164
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,041
I want you to conduct
the interrogation.

165
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,917
I would be honored.

166
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,875
Captain. Admiral.

167
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:18,625
Captain,
I predict that officer

168
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,250
will be extremely valuable
in this investigation.

169
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,500
I have tracked
the movements

170
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,792
of every person who has
left the<i> Enterprise</i>

171
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,250
since you have been here.

172
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,000
I traced
one Tarkanian diplomat

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,625
as far as
the Cruces system

174
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,500
where he disappeared

175
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,333
and has not
been seen since.

176
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,542
That proves nothing.

177
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,792
A hypo-syringe...

178
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,667
was discovered
in your quarters.

179
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,125
I take injections.

180
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,542
Everyone knows that.

181
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,583
But your injections
do not include

182
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,542
an optical chip reader.

183
00:09:57,542 --> 00:10:00,250
This device has
but one function--

184
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,208
To transform
computer information

185
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,625
into biological
sequences.

186
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,917
The blood
of all Klingons

187
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,125
has become water!

188
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,667
Since the Federation
Alliance,

189
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,166
we are turned into a nation
of mewling babies.

190
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,917
The Romulans are strong.

191
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:16,542
They are
worthy allies.

192
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,250
They do not turn Klingons
into weaklings, like you.

193
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,417
SATIE:
Lieutenant...

194
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,417
how did you damage
the dilithium chamber?

195
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:30,542
I had nothing to do
with that.

196
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,458
You mean it was
sheer coincidence

197
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:36,333
that it was sabotaged after you
gave the plans for the design

198
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,667
to the Romulans?

199
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,583
I do not know.
I had nothing to do with it.

200
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,709
You've admitted
your crime.

201
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,709
Why lie now?

202
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,959
I am not lying.

203
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,333
Mr. Worf, you may
have him confined.

204
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,750
Sabin?

205
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,834
I believe
he's telling the truth.

206
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,333
He admits stealing
the files,

207
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,709
but not sabotaging
the dilithium chamber.

208
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:12,125
I get no sense
that he's lying.

209
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,834
But if you're right,

210
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:16,208
someone else may be
involved.

211
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,792
I think, Captain,

212
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:19,834
you have a bigger
problem on your ship

213
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:23,417
than just one Klingon
exchange officer.

214
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,542
I've seen this before.

215
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:41,834
A specter of conspiracy
on a starship

216
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,959
is a frightening one.

217
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:47,000
I can scarcely
believe it myself.

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,291
But I am so grateful
for your presence, Admiral.

219
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:54,083
If anyone in Starfleet
can help us, it's you.

220
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,125
Captain...

221
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,500
I find myself changing
my mind about you.

222
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,875
In what way?

223
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,166
When Starfleet
ordered me here,

224
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,208
it was with
the expressed command

225
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,792
that we work together
on this problem as equals.

226
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:12,917
My father taught me
to avoid partnerships.

227
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:15,250
Most of them are
woefully lopsided.

228
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,291
That sounds like
Judge Aaron Satie.

229
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,667
You knew my father?

230
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,375
Only from
his writings.

231
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,166
His judgments were required
reading at the Academy.

232
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,166
He was
an extraordinary man.

233
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,709
Every night,
at the dinner table,

234
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:35,125
he would pose
a question for debate.

235
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,375
My big brothers and I
would wrangle it around

236
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,166
from one side
and the other.

237
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,750
Father would referee.

238
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,291
And he kept
a stopwatch on us

239
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,709
so we would have
to learn brevity,

240
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,166
But he wouldn't
let us leave

241
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,667
until he thought
we'd completely

242
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,208
explored the issue.

243
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,542
I'm willing to wager that
you trounced your brothers

244
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:52,875
during those debates.

245
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,792
More than once.

246
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:57,583
Father loved it when
I nailed one of them

247
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,291
with some subtle
point of logic.

248
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,166
All that I am,
I owe to him.

249
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,125
He was a giant.

250
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,417
You must miss him
very much.

251
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:17,000
Captain, I always
preferred working alone.

252
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That way,
if something went wrong,

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,625
I didn't have to go
far for the cause.

254
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,041
I resented you
being assigned to me,

255
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,125
but I was wrong.

256
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,041
We're going to be
quite a team.

257
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:36,291
J'ddan did not make
friends easily.

258
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,500
There are not
many to question.

259
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,834
You've done a thorough job,
Lieutenant.

260
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:43,458
I am strongly motivated
in this matter.

261
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,125
Yes, I can see that.

262
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,709
I don't mind telling you,
I'm surprised.

263
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:52,625
Frankly, when I first
heard about your father...

264
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,875
My father?

265
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,750
Yes.

266
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,166
There are some who believe
he betrayed your people

267
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,166
to the Romulans.

268
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,000
What he did
or did not do

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,166
is no one's concern
but my own.

270
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,041
Of course.
I only meant,

271
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,125
before I saw you in action,
I naturally considered

272
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,375
you to be a possible
security risk.

273
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,917
But I want you to know

274
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,583
you have the Admiral's
and my complete confidence.

275
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,000
You have nothing
to prove to us.

276
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,458
If there is
a conspiracy on board,

277
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,458
I promise you,
I will find it.

278
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,750
Good.

279
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,125
You know the ship,
you know the personnel.

280
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,166
You know exactly what
we're up against.

281
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,875
We're counting
on you, Lieutenant.

282
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,291
I will arrange for
the interviews to begin.

283
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,125
And how often did
Lieutenant J'ddan

284
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,834
come in for
his injections?

285
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,125
About once a week.

286
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,750
Did you administer
them yourself?

287
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,166
No.

288
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,834
Well, who did?

289
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:49,083
I had one of
my assistants do that.

290
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,667
Did you ever hear him
say anything,

291
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,875
anything that may have
seemed innocent at the time

292
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,417
that might now shed some
light on this investigation?

293
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:57,375
No, nothing.

294
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,000
In fact, he rarely
spoke at all.

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,333
Thank you,
Dr. Crusher.

296
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,750
We appreciate your time,
you're excused.

297
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,291
Mr. Worf, will you
bring in the next person?

298
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:15,792
Please sit down,
Mr. Tarses.

299
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,208
For the record,
will you tell us

300
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,959
your name and position?

301
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,208
Simon Tarses,
Crewman First Class,

302
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,542
medical technician.

303
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,083
Now I assure you,
Mr. Tarses,

304
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,542
this is
an informal inquiry.

305
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,500
We are not accusing
you of anything.

306
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,834
However, if you
would like counsel,

307
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,333
it can be provided.

308
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,709
No, sir,
I have nothing to hide.

309
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,542
Tell me, how long have
you held your appointment

310
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:41,625
aboard this vessel?

311
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,500
Since Stardate 43587.

312
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,250
Mr. Tarses,
your records state

313
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,625
that you were born
on Mars Colony.

314
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,083
That's right.

315
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,667
Then you are human?

316
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,291
Largely.

317
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,792
My paternal grandfather
was Vulcan.

318
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,166
Yes, I see that.

319
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,083
Tell me, what is
your relationship

320
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,875
with the Klingon,
J'ddan?

321
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,542
Um, he...

322
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,375
I mean, there's no
relationship.

323
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,375
He just came in
for his injections.

324
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,583
Did you give him
those injections?

325
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,125
Sometimes.

326
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,875
There were several of us,
actually.

327
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,000
I-- I might have
done it twice.

328
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,875
Did he ever make
any comments that might

329
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,875
in retrospect
be suspicious?

330
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,875
Not really.
He hardly ever talked.

331
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,834
Did you ever see him
outside Sick Bay?

332
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,291
Once or twice
in Ten Forward,

333
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,917
with a group of people...

334
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:33,458
but I never had
a conversation with him.

335
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,458
Thank you, Mr. Tarses.

336
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,834
I don't think there's
need for more, Captain.

337
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:39,625
You're excused,
crewman.

338
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,625
Mr. Worf...

339
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,583
Wait.
He's lying.

340
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,000
He's desperately frightened.
He's covering something.

341
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,709
It's clear that
he's frightened.

342
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:54,333
But that's hardly
an indication...

343
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,291
It's more than that.
He wasn't truthful.

344
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,041
He's covering a lie.

345
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,208
One so big,
it's overwhelming him.

346
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,208
I think
we found the man.

347
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,667
Admiral.

348
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,166
I have to tell you,

349
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,959
you must not expect me
to permit any action

350
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,250
against Mr. Tarses
solely on the basis

351
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,083
of Betazoid intuition.

352
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,750
Sabin has
uncanny instincts.

353
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,417
I've learned
to trust them.

354
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:37,834
I'm not happy about
this use of a Betazoid.

355
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:40,083
But you have
a Betazoid counselor.

356
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,667
Surely you're aware
of the advantages.

357
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:45,041
There is a difference
between a counselor

358
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,667
and an investigator.

359
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,166
Are you saying you never
use your counselor

360
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,792
during interrogations?

361
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,667
Yes, I do...

362
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,208
but I would not act

363
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,458
solely on the basis
of her instinct.

364
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,333
Nor do I.

365
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,250
But you're asking...

366
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,500
you're asking me
to restrict

367
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,875
Mr. Tarses' movements

368
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,542
solely on the basis
of Sabin's<i> feeling.</i>

369
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,625
If Counselor Troi
suggested to you

370
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,750
that someone on the ship
were dangerous,

371
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,625
would you not
act on that?

372
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:24,083
Observe him,
curb his activity?

373
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,166
Yes, I admit
I probably would,

374
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,333
and perhaps I should
re-evaluate that behavior.

375
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,542
Oh, nonsense.

376
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,917
Let's keep
our priorities straight.

377
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:37,041
The important thing is
to uncover

378
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,458
the conspiracy on this ship

379
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,333
and to prevent
further damage.

380
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,041
Now, if Tarses is
a possible saboteur,

381
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,750
you<i> cannot</i> allow him access
to sensitive areas of this ship,

382
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,542
and I strongly suggest
continuous surveillance.

383
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:59,458
If we had
clear evidence...

384
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,875
We<i> will</i> have
clear evidence.

385
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:05,125
Sabin and Lieutenant Worf
are continuing to investigate.

386
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,291
But if we don't
act until then,

387
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,750
it may be too late.

388
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,917
No.

389
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,291
I won't treat a man
as a criminal

390
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,208
unless there is
cause to do so.

391
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,917
And while you're
being so generous,

392
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:24,834
you give a saboteur
a chance to strike again?

393
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:27,166
Last time, it was
just a hatch cover.

394
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,166
What if next time
it's more serious?

395
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,458
What if lives are lost?

396
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,792
Can you afford
<i>not</i> to act?

397
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:36,125
LA FORGE:
Engineering to Captain Picard.

398
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,583
Yes, Mr. La Forge?

399
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,792
Captain, could you come
to Engineering right away?

400
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:42,500
We've got something
interesting to show you.

401
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,875
We'll be right there.

402
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,166
Captain, we finally got
in here about six hours ago,

403
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,667
and we've been going over it
inch by inch ever since.

404
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,917
We've made micro-
tomographic analyses

405
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,417
of the dilithium chamber,
the hatch mounting,

406
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:59,166
the blast pattern
from the explosion.

407
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,500
We did mass spectrometer
readings of the residue

408
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
for chemical contents,
sifted through the debris

409
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,625
for bomb fragments.

410
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,083
What did you find?

411
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,083
This is the frame
for the hatch.

412
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,375
It ruptured
right along here.

413
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,834
And when we take
a reading of that spot...

414
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,625
See?

415
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,291
I'm afraid I'm out of
my element, Commander.

416
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,125
You'll have
to interpret for me.

417
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,333
There are sub-micron fractures
in the metal casing.

418
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,917
That's right. A breakdown of
the atomic cohesive structure.

419
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:31,041
Yes, and what caused them?

420
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,667
DATA:
Those fractures suggest

421
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:35,375
nothing more than
simple neutron fatigue.

422
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,125
I would speculate that,
when the engine was

423
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,417
last inspected
at McKinley Station,

424
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:41,166
the hatch casing was
replaced with one

425
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,542
which had
an undetectable defect.

426
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,041
I believe, sir,
that the conclusion

427
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,917
to our investigation
must be that the explosion

428
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:49,333
was not intentional.

429
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,792
That's the way
I see it.

430
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,333
This wasn't
sabotage at all.

431
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,375
It was nothing more
than... an accident.

432
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,125
An accident?

433
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,750
I find that hard
to believe.

434
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,166
If my crew say
there was no sabotage,

435
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,458
you can be sure
there was none.

436
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,208
Let us keep our perspective,
gentlemen.

437
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,959
Just because
there was no sabotage

438
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:15,750
doesn't mean there isn't
a conspiracy on this ship.

439
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,625
We do have
a confessed spy.

440
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,667
And he had
confederates.

441
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:20,959
Do we know that for sure?

442
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:23,041
Of course he did.
Do you think J'ddan

443
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,709
could have come on board
the flagship of the Federation

444
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:28,709
and accomplish what he did
without help from within?

445
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,333
I agree, it would be
difficult.

446
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,917
But not impossible.

447
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,917
We should continue
to investigate Tarses.

448
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:41,041
He<i> was</i> hiding something.

449
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,125
Captain Picard,
Lieutenant Worf and I

450
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,333
have been working
well together.

451
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,917
I suggest we continue,

452
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:47,542
if for no other purpose
than to determine

453
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:48,959
Tarses's innocence.

454
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,417
Now please,
let me remind you,

455
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:53,458
he<i> is</i> innocent until he is
proved guilty.

456
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,166
Of course he is.

457
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,375
What Sabin is saying is
that he and Lieutenant Worf

458
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,875
would like
to establish

459
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,208
his innocence
unequivocally,

460
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,709
for his own sake.

461
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:06,250
Very well.

462
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,250
But let us put this to rest
as quickly as possible.

463
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,625
You've opened the hearing
to spectators?

464
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,959
It isn't good to have
closed-door proceedings

465
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,208
for too long.

466
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,750
It invites rumor
and speculation.

467
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,250
Nevertheless, Admiral,
I think it would be wise--

468
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,333
Because spies
and saboteurs

469
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:41,709
don't like the bright lights
of an open inquiry.

470
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:43,125
They're like roaches,

471
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,542
scurrying for
the dark corner.

472
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:55,583
This hearing is convened
on Stardate 44780

473
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,667
as a continuing
inquiry into

474
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,333
the activities
of crewman Simon Tarses.

475
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,875
Mr. Tarses,
for your own protection,

476
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,917
I have assigned
a counsel to you

477
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,208
in the person
of Commander William Riker.

478
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,917
Thank you, sir,
but I don't need protection.

479
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:12,166
I have not done
anything wrong.

480
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,917
Dr. Crusher,

481
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:17,625
have you observed
crewman Tarses with J'ddan?

482
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:21,166
Well, yes, he gave him
his injection.

483
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,500
I meant
outside of Sick Bay.

484
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:29,000
I think so.
Perhaps in Ten Forward.

485
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,458
And whom else have you
observed at these occasions?

486
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,667
I don't understand
what relevance that has.

487
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:37,333
It was an innocent
social gathering.

488
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,458
If it was so innocent,

489
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:42,458
why do you hesitate
to give us the names?

490
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,709
Thank you, Doctor.

491
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:46,375
(<i> whispers:</i> ) Admiral,
if you have a case

492
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,834
to make against
Simon Tarses,

493
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:49,166
you had better make it.

494
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,709
Otherwise I'm stopping
this here and now.

495
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:01,125
Mr. Tarses,

496
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,917
isn't it true
that you have access

497
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:05,333
to the biological
supplies in Sick Bay?

498
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,667
It's part of my job, yes.

499
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:09,125
J'ddan used suspensions
of deoxyribose

500
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,458
to carry the encoded
files he stole.

501
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,834
Isn't it true
one of your duties

502
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:14,458
is to prepare these
suspensions?

503
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,208
Several technicians
share that job.

504
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,333
And isn't it true that
your security clearance

505
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,500
allow you access to all the
stores and files in Sick Bay?

506
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,750
Access which you can
exercise at any time?

507
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,375
Because I have access
does not mean I...

508
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,917
What would you say if
I told you there is evidence...

509
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:29,750
that the explosion
in the engine room

510
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,709
was caused by
a corrosive chemical--

511
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:34,959
one that is kept
stored in Sick Bay?

512
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,709
I had nothing to do
with that.

513
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,291
How can we believe you?

514
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,709
How can we believe
someone whom we know...

515
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:43,875
we<i> know</i> to be a liar?

516
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,583
I object,
there is no basis

517
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,417
for calling
crewman Tarses a liar.

518
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:48,875
Agreed. Mr. Sabin...

519
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,709
Captain, there is a basis
which will become clear

520
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:52,542
in a moment.

521
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:55,542
Mr. Tarses, didn't you
deliberately and premeditatively

522
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,458
lie when you filled out
your personnel application

523
00:24:57,458 --> 00:25:00,375
and compounded that lie by
repeating it to this committee?

524
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,625
What?

525
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,250
Isn't it true

526
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,625
that the paternal grandfather
of whom you speak

527
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:08,041
was not a Vulcan
but was in fact a Romulan?

528
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,750
That it is
Romulan blood you carry

529
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,959
and a Romulan heritage
that you honor?

530
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,000
We're waiting,
Mr. Tarses.

531
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,542
On the advice
of my counsel...

532
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:23,041
I refuse to answer
that question in...

533
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:27,625
in that the answer
might...

534
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,291
might serve
to incriminate me.

535
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,083
You and crewman Marcus
will coordinate

536
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:53,375
to track Tarses's movements
over the last five years.

537
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:56,709
Ensign Kellogg, I want
a list of all relatives,

538
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:58,458
known associates,
and especially

539
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,375
old school friends.

540
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:01,750
And make
arrangements to do

541
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,250
an encephalographic
polygraph scan...

542
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,875
Mr. Worf.

543
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,166
Yes, Captain?

544
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,917
I need to speak
with you.

545
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:12,709
You are dismissed.

546
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:15,125
Please get your reports to me
as soon as possible.

547
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,333
Do you see what is
happening here, Mr. Worf?

548
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,625
Sir?

549
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:34,125
This is not unlike a...

550
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,542
a drumhead trial.

551
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:40,583
I do not understand.

552
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,875
500 years ago,
military officers

553
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,583
would upend a drum
on the battlefield.

554
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:48,583
They'd sit at it
and dispense summary justice.

555
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,625
Decisions were quick,
punishments severe,

556
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,959
appeals denied.

557
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:56,959
Those who came
to a drumhead were doomed.

558
00:26:56,959 --> 00:27:00,667
But we know there is
a traitor here.

559
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,458
J'ddan has
admitted his guilt.

560
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,709
That's true, and he will
stand for his crime.

561
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:06,750
Tarses has all
but done the same.

562
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,875
How?

563
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,375
He refused to answer
the question

564
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,041
about his Romulan
grandfather.

565
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:14,125
That is not
a crime, Worf!

566
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:17,500
Nor can we infer his guilt
because he didn't respond.

567
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,125
Sir, if a man were not afraid
of the truth, he would answer.

568
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,500
Oh, no.

569
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,834
We cannot allow
ourselves to think that.

570
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:30,166
The seventh guarantee

571
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,125
is one of the most
important rights

572
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,667
granted by
the Federation.

573
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:36,083
We cannot take
a fundamental principle

574
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:39,166
of the constitution
and turn it against a citizen.

575
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:43,375
Sir, the Federation
does have enemies.

576
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,125
We must seek them out.

577
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,375
Oh, yes.

578
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:52,625
That's how it starts.

579
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:56,458
But the road from
legitimate suspicion

580
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,083
to rampant paranoia

581
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,667
is very much shorter
than we think.

582
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:02,166
Something is wrong
here, Mr. Worf.

583
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,834
I don't like
what we have become.

584
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,917
There you are,
Mr. Tarses.

585
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:19,625
Would you care
for some lemon?

586
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,208
No, thank you, sir,
this is fine.

587
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,083
Well, tell me a little
about yourself, crewman.

588
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,667
I know you were born
on Mars Colony.

589
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,125
Yes, sir.

590
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,333
All my life,
I wanted to be in Starfleet.

591
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,291
I went to the Academy's
training program

592
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:38,834
for enlisted personnel.

593
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:41,041
I took training as
a medical technician,

594
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:44,500
and I served
at several outposts.

595
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,291
The day that I was posted
to the<i> Enterprise</i>

596
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,000
was the happiest day
of my life.

597
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,041
Did you ever consider
applying to the Academy,

598
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:53,458
going the whole route?
Apply to become an officer?

599
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:57,375
My parents wanted me to,
and I thought about it.

600
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,542
I used to sit under
this big tree

601
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:02,667
near the parade grounds.

602
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,500
An elm tree with
a circular bench?

603
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,083
Yes, that's the one.

604
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,208
I spent many
an hour there.

605
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,083
It was my favorite
spot to study.

606
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,333
I used to sit
under that tree

607
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,458
and watch the drills.

608
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,792
Picture myself
an officer.

609
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:21,625
I know that it would have made
my mother very happy,

610
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,291
but I...

611
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:26,291
You didn't do it.
No.

612
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:30,208
I was 18 and eager.

613
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,750
The last thing I wanted
was to spend four years

614
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,959
sitting in classrooms.

615
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:39,333
I wanted to be
out there,

616
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,500
traveling the stars.

617
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,542
I didn't want to wait
for anything.

618
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:51,625
Now it's done,
isn't it?

619
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,250
My career in Starfleet
is finished.

620
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,959
Not if you aren't
guilty, Simon.

621
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:00,917
It doesn't matter.

622
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,750
I lied on
my application.

623
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:10,458
And that mistake will be with me
for the rest of my life.

624
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:18,000
Mr. Worf has
found a brother

625
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,750
who still lives
on Mars Colony.

626
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,000
Contact someone there
and have him interviewed.

627
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,291
Admiral Satie?
And start

628
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:25,166
a background checkup
into all his friends

629
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,291
at the Academy
training program.

630
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,125
Admiral Satie?
Yes, Captain?

631
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,834
I would like to have
a word with you.

632
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:31,750
Of course.

633
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,667
In private.

634
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,709
And off the record.

635
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,291
Of course.

636
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:40,125
After all, you are
my partner in this.

637
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:46,667
I cannot possibly
believe you mean this.

638
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,166
But I do.

639
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,375
This must stop.
It has gone too far.

640
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:52,208
You lied to him
about the engine room.

641
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,834
There were no volatile
chemicals found there.

642
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:57,959
It was a tactic-- a way
of applying pressure.

643
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,083
We're hounding
an innocent man.

644
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:04,542
And how, may I ask, have you
managed to determine that?

645
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,291
I've talked with him.

646
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,041
I see.

647
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:13,417
And he told you he was
a victim of circumstance.

648
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:15,083
Blameless and pure?

649
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,458
No, he admits
his mistake

650
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,500
in falsifying
his application,

651
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,750
but that does not
make him a traitor.

652
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:27,166
How can you be
so incredibly naive?

653
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,959
Captain...

654
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:35,125
may I tell you how I have
spent the last four years?

655
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:38,166
From planet to starbase
to planet.

656
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,917
I have no home.

657
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:43,250
I live on starships
and shuttlecraft.

658
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,542
I haven't seen
a family member in years.

659
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:49,458
I have no friends.

660
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,208
But I have a purpose.

661
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:54,083
My father taught me from
the time I was a little girl

662
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,125
still clutching a blanket

663
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,875
that the United
Federation of Planets

664
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,834
is the most remarkable
institution ever conceived,

665
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:05,375
and it is my cause
to make sure that

666
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:09,625
this extraordinary union
be preserved.

667
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:12,417
I cannot imagine
why you are trying

668
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:14,500
to block this
investigation.

669
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,500
There have been others
in the past who doubted me.

670
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:21,208
They came to regret it.

671
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:30,750
The hearings on
Simon Tarses will stop.

672
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,500
If necessary, I will go
to Starfleet Command.

673
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,583
I have news
for you, Captain.

674
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,959
I've been in constant contact
with Starfleet Command.

675
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,709
The hearings are
not going to stop.

676
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:44,208
They're going to be
expanded.

677
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,041
What are you saying?

678
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,583
I'm going to get
to the heart

679
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:50,750
of this conspiracy
if it means investigating

680
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,417
every last person
on this ship.

681
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:56,250
And every hearing
from now on...

682
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,625
will be held
in the presence

683
00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:01,208
of Admiral Thomas Henry
of Starfleet security.

684
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,834
I've requested he be
brought here at once.

685
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:05,583
You never told me
about this.

686
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,709
I report to Starfleet
Command directly.

687
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:10,583
I do not need
your permission

688
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:13,417
or your approval
for my decisions.

689
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,083
Admiral.

690
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,333
What you're
doing here...

691
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:23,250
is unethical...
it's immoral.

692
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:26,625
I'll fight it.

693
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,834
Do what you must,
Captain.

694
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,333
And so will I.

695
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:46,250
Captain, warp engines
are back online.

696
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,959
We are ready to commence
restart sequences.

697
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,583
Sir?

698
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:53,875
Yes?

699
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:56,917
Yes, yes, of course,
proceed, Mr. Data.

700
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:03,083
You all right,
Captain?

701
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:06,041
Yes, of course, Number One,
just a little preoccupied.

702
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,542
Admiral Satie has
ordered you to report

703
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:11,709
to the interrogation room

704
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:14,709
at 0900 hours
tomorrow morning.

705
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:17,625
You are to be questioned
before the committee.

706
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,709
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

707
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:33,709
<i>Admiral Thomas Henry,</i>

708
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:36,333
<i>who has worked closely</i>
<i>with Norah Satie in the past,</i>

709
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,792
<i>has arrived to observe</i>
<i>the hearings.</i>

710
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:42,000
Your full name?

711
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,208
Jean-Luc Picard.

712
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,458
Rank and position?

713
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,417
Captain, Federation
Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

714
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,041
How long have you
held this post?

715
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:51,291
Over three years,
since Stardate 41124.

716
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:53,458
Very well.
Admiral.

717
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,917
If you don't mind, there is
something I would like to say.

718
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:57,333
If you have a statement,

719
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,667
you'll have an opportunity
to make it later.

720
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:02,417
I believe that
Chapter Four, Article 12

721
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:03,917
of the Uniform Code
of Justice

722
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:05,667
grants me the right
to make a statement

723
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,375
before questioning begins.

724
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,875
Very well.

725
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,667
I'm deeply concerned about
what is happening here.

726
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:21,291
It began when
we apprehended a spy.

727
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,959
A man who admitted
his guilt

728
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:25,625
and who will
answer for his crime.

729
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,875
But the hunt didn't
end there.

730
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,291
Another man...

731
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:32,583
Mr. Simon Tarses,
was brought to trial.

732
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:34,667
And it was a trial.

733
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:38,625
No matter what others
choose to call it.

734
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:42,125
A trial based
on insinuation...

735
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,834
and innuendo.

736
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:47,291
Nothing substantive offered
against Mr. Tarses,

737
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:48,917
much less proven.

738
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:54,875
Mr. Tarses'
grandfather...

739
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,875
is Romulan,

740
00:35:56,875 --> 00:36:01,291
and for that reason,
his career now stands in ruins.

741
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:07,458
Have we become
so fearful--

742
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:10,875
have we become
so cowardly...

743
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:15,417
that we must
extinguish a man...

744
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:18,583
because he carries the blood
of a current enemy?

745
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,291
Admiral...

746
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:27,709
let us not condemn
Simon Tarses or anyone else

747
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:29,875
because of their
bloodlines

748
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,917
or investigate others

749
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:35,375
for their innocent
associations.

750
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:36,750
I implore you.

751
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:41,542
Do not continue
with this... proceeding.

752
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,375
End it now.

753
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:48,875
Captain, do you believe
in the Prime Directive?

754
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,333
Of course.

755
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,125
In fact,
it's Starfleet's

756
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,709
General Order Number 1,
is it not?

757
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,000
Your point, Admiral?

758
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,959
Would it surprise you
to learn that you have

759
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,750
violated
the Prime Directive

760
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,458
a total of nine times

761
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:04,500
since you took command
of the<i> Enterprise?</i>

762
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,625
I must say, Captain,

763
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:08,000
it surprised
the hell out of me.

764
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,166
My reports to Starfleet
will document

765
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:12,291
the circumstances
of those instances.

766
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,917
Yes, we're looking into
those reports, Captain.

767
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:17,750
Very closely
into those reports,

768
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,166
after which, I'm sure
we'll have more questions

769
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,500
for you about your
so-called commitment

770
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,125
to Starfleet
Prime Directive.

771
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,709
Captain,
could you tell us

772
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:34,792
just what happened
on Stardate 44390?

773
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,041
I beg your pardon?

774
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,583
Let me refresh
your memory.

775
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:42,542
You were transporting
a Vulcan ambassador, T'pel.

776
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,875
I was following orders

777
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:49,417
to take
this ambassador

778
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,458
to a location near
the Neutral Zone.

779
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,333
I don't think
we need the preamble.

780
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:56,917
In fact, she was not
a Vulcan at all, was she?

781
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:58,834
She was a Romulan spy.

782
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:02,333
That's correct.

783
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,875
A spy whom
you were delivering

784
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,542
back into the hands
of the enemy.

785
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:09,166
Tell me, Captain,
when the deception was revealed,

786
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,125
and she stood proudly
on the bridge

787
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,667
of a Romulan ship,

788
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:15,166
did you make any effort
to retrieve her?

789
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,417
PICARD:
No.

790
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:18,709
No? Even though
you knew

791
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:20,625
she carried
Federation secrets

792
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:24,083
that she had been
accumulating for<i> years?</i>

793
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:27,709
The Enterprise could have been
captured by the Romulans.

794
00:38:27,709 --> 00:38:30,625
Captain Picard did
the only thing he could.

795
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,041
Really, Lieutenant.

796
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:33,709
And where were you
when this traitor

797
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:35,750
was on board
the<i> Enterprise?</i>

798
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,625
Where was
ship's security?

799
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,000
SABIN:
Don't you think it's

800
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,458
questionable judgment,
Captain, to have

801
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:42,083
a security officer
whose father was

802
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:43,500
a Romulan collaborator?

803
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:46,583
PICARD:
Lieutenant.

804
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,625
Tell me, Captain.

805
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:00,542
Have you completely
recovered

806
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:03,709
from your experience
with the Borg?

807
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:08,000
Yes, I have
completely recovered.

808
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,792
It must have been
awful for you.

809
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:14,417
Actually becoming
one of them.

810
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:17,166
Being forced to use
your vast knowledge

811
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:20,959
of Starfleet Operations
to aid the Borg.

812
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:24,333
Just how many
of our ships were lost?

813
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,417
39?

814
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,834
And a loss of life,
I believe,

815
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:32,000
measured at
nearly 11,000.

816
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,959
One wonders how you
can sleep at night,

817
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:38,583
having caused
so much destruction.

818
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,959
I question your actions,
Captain.

819
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:42,959
I question
your choices.

820
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:45,583
I question
your loyalty.

821
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,792
You know, there are
some words I've known

822
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:52,291
since I was a schoolboy.

823
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:56,083
"With the first link,
the chain is forged.

824
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:58,166
"The first speech censured,

825
00:39:58,166 --> 00:40:00,166
"the first thought
forbidden,

826
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:02,291
"the first
freedom denied,

827
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:04,625
chains us all irrevocably."

828
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:10,625
Those words were uttered
by Judge Aaron Satie

829
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:14,542
as wisdom and warning.

830
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:18,834
The first time
any man's freedom...

831
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,667
is trodden on,

832
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:23,750
we are all damaged.

833
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,333
I fear that today...

834
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,750
How dare you!

835
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,625
You who consort with
Romulans...

836
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,250
invoke my father's name

837
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,125
to support your
traitorous arguments?

838
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:38,750
It is an offense
to everything I hold dear,

839
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,083
and to hear those words

840
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,291
used to subvert

841
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,750
the United Federation
of Planets!

842
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,667
My father was
a great man.

843
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:50,333
His name stands for
integrity and principle.

844
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:54,542
You dirty his name
when you speak it.

845
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:56,542
He loved
the Federation,

846
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:58,959
but you, Captain,
corrupt it.

847
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:02,250
You undermine
our very way of life.

848
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,291
I will expose you
for what you are.

849
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:06,875
I've brought down

850
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:09,125
bigger men than you,
Picard.

851
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:36,917
I have nothing more
to say.

852
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:50,667
Perhaps we should call
a recess until tomorrow.

853
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,917
Am I bothering you,
Captain?

854
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:37,417
No, please,
Mr. Worf, come in.

855
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:49,333
It is over.

856
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,959
Admiral Henry
has called an end

857
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:54,458
to any more hearings
on this matter.

858
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:56,041
That's good.

859
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:02,625
Admiral Satie has
left the<i> Enterprise.</i>

860
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,125
We think we've
come so far.

861
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,917
Torture of heretics,

862
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:15,500
burning of witches is
all ancient history,

863
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,000
and then, before
you can blink an eye,

864
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,542
suddenly it threatens
to start all over again.

865
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,625
I believed her.

866
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,917
I... I helped her.

867
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:36,667
I did not see
what she was.

868
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:40,166
Mr. Worf, villains who
twirl their moustaches

869
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:41,667
are easy to spot.

870
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:44,250
Those who clothe
themselves in good deeds

871
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,333
are well-camouflaged.

872
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:51,375
I think,
after yesterday,

873
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:54,500
people will not be
so ready to trust her.

874
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,458
Maybe.

875
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:58,792
But she,
or someone like her,

876
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:00,417
will always be
with us.

877
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:03,417
Waiting for the right climate
in which to flourish.

878
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:07,375
Spreading fear
in the name of righteousness.

879
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:14,542
Vigilance, Mr. Worf.

880
00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:17,583
That is the price we have
to continually pay.
