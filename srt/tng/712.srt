I don't see why we have
to do this every year.

2
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:07,667
I thought that last year
the teachers had agreed

3
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,750
that they wouldn't
do this anymore.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,291
"Captain Picard Day"

5
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,959
is one of the children's
favorite school activities.

6
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:16,041
They look forward
to it all year.

7
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:20,000
Why does it
have to be me?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,125
Because you're
the captain

9
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,834
and they look
up to you.

10
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,458
You're a role
model for them.

11
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,667
Well...

12
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,000
they seem to have

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,125
a somewhat exaggerated
impression of me.

14

I don't know,
I think the resemblance

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,667
is rather striking.

16
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:34,083
Wouldn't you agree,
Number One?

17
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,291

else you have to do?

18

19
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,041

here in half an hour.

21

second and third place

22
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:00,375

34

Good. I'm postponing
the quasar study for the moment.

So who won the contest?

52

Oh. Paul Menegay,
a seven year old.

53
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,166
He did a most interesting
clay sculpture of my head.

54

Was that the orange one
with the lumpy skin?

55

Yes.
Mm-hmm.

As you know,
the Starship<i> Pegasus</i>

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,458
was lost in this sector
some 12 years ago

88
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,834
along with most of her crew.

89
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,083
I was her captain

90

here was my helmsman.

91
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,000
I remember
hearing about it.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,291
The ship

93

managed to make it
to the escape pod

96
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:40,291
before the breach
became critical.

97
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,041
From space, we observed
what appeared to be

98
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,291
a matter/antimatter explosion
which vaporized the ship.

99

No wreckage was found

100

declared the ship destroyed.

However,

102
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,458

three days ago.

103

105
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,166
He sent us a message
that a Romulan warbird

106
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,875
had located
a piece of debris

107
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,792
in the Devolin system

108
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:06,959
which was positively
identified as being
from the<i> Pegasus.</i>

109
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,667
The warbird was then ordered

110
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:11,375
to locate the rest of the ship
if possible and retrieve it.

111

00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,250
Commander, how long
will it take us

181
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,542
to search this system?

182
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,333
LA FORGE:
At least seven
days, sir.

183
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,083
WORF:
And the Romulans have
a two-day head start.

184
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,083
Then let's get to it.

185
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,583
Mr. Data?

186
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,375
Initiating sensor sweep
of grid 01.

187
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,166
So how long have
you had that beard?

188
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,291
About four years.

189
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,458
I got tired of hearing
how young I looked.

190
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,375
What was it that...

191
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,041
Lieutenant Boylen
used to call you?

192
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,875
"Ensign baby face."

193
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,458
(<i> chuckling</i> )

194
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,625
You never did
have much of
a sense of humor.

195
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,333
I like to think that I've
lightened up a little

196
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,291
in my old age.

197
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,750
Really?

198
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,542
I've been known
to tell a joke or two.

199
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:35,917
Well, it's about time.

200
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:37,750
You were always so
serious on the<i> Pegasus.</i>

201
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,458
Well...

202
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,375
We went through
some serious times.

203
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,667
Do you really think
we're going to find
the<i> Pegasus</i> again?

204
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,333
I wouldn't have come all
the way out here if I didn't.

205
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,875
What about the experiment?

206
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,333
Do you think we're going
to find that, too?

207
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,667
Maybe.

208
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,875
You know, I think a lot
about what happened...

209
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,208
especially on that last day.

210
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,166
So do I.

211
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,709
It's not the
kind of thing
you just forget.

212
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:15,333
Do you ever wonder
if we did the right thing?

213
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,792
Never.

214
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,208
What happened was
a tragedy, yes

215
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,125
but it wasn't your fault
and it wasn't mine.

216
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,166
What we were doing was for
the good of the Federation

217
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,542
and we can't
blame ourselves

218
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,083
if the others
couldn't see that.

219
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,959
I know, but...

220
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,667
maybe we went about it
the wrong way.

221
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,500
Well, this time
we may have a chance

222
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,959
to do it
the right way.

223
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,041
If this mission is successful

224
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,375
if we find the<i> Pegasus</i>
and the experiment

225
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,166
we can finish what we started
12 years ago.

226
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,458
You want to try again?

227
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,417
It's not
just me, Will.

228
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:53,458
The chief of Starfleet Security
has personally given me

229
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,542
her assurance
of complete support.

230
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,125
Admiral Ranar!

231
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,959
How many other people
know about this?

232
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,375
Not many, and it's up to us

233
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,375
to make sure
it stays that way.

234
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,625
Ranar has given me
written orders for you.

235
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,834
You'll find them coded
in the<i> Enterprise</i> computer.

236
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,917
You've been instructed
not to reveal

237
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,250
the true nature
of our mission to anyone else

238
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,208
not even Captain Picard.

239
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,959
Will... don't worry.

240
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,041
It won't be like it was
12 years ago

241
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,583
and this time,
no one's going to stop us.

242
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:34,041
♪♪

243
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,875
As a matter of fact,
I never met Will

244
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,625
until he reported on board
at Farpoint Station.

245
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,000
You chose your
first officer

246
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,709
without ever
meeting him?

247
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:49,375
I was looking
through the records

248
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,041
of about 50 candidates

249
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:54,917
and Will's was very much
like all the others--

250
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:58,375
filled with lots
of dry statistics

251
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,166
and glowing letters
of recommendation

252
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,000
that tell you nothing.

253
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,375
I was about
to put it aside

254
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:11,041
and look at another
file, and then...

255
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,417
something caught my eye.

256
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:18,000
There was an incident
on Altair III

257
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,041
when Will was first
officer of the<i> Hood.</i>

258
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,500
He refused to let
Captain Desoto beam down

259
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,583
during a crisis.

260
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,333
He disobeyed
a direct order

261
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,625
and he risked a
general court-martial

262
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,917
because he thought
he was<i> right.</i>

263
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,667
And when I read that,
I knew that I had found

264
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,000
my Number One.

265
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,333
You wanted someone
with a history of disobedience?

266
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,458
I wanted someone who
would stand up to me

267
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,250
someone who
was more concerned

268
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,000
with the safety of the ship
and accomplishing the mission

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,458
than with how it might
look on his record.

270
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,542
To me, that's one of the marks
of a good officer.

271
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,375
Frankly, I've always felt
it was more important

272
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,125
for an officer
to trust his captain's judgment.

273
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,291
In a crisis, there's no time
for explanations.

274
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,125
Orders have to be
obeyed without question

275
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,041
or lives may be lost.

276
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,792
I am aware of that, Admiral.

277
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,875
Of course you are.

278
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:16,875
I guess this mission
has brought up

279
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,875
some old ghosts for me.

280
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,667
You know what it's like
to lose a ship?

281
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:24,834
You're always wondering
if there's something else

282
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,375
you should have done.

283
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,917
Something you missed.

284
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,250
Admiral,
the record regarding

285
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,250
the loss of the<i> Pegasus</i> is...

286
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,667
a bit vague

287
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:39,875
from the moment
just before you abandoned ship.

288
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,417
Is there anything
that you can add

289
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:42,792
to the official account?

290
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,041
I'm afraid not.

291
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,208
But I can tell you this--

292
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,417
12 years ago,
I needed an officer

293
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,125
that I could count on
in a crisis

294
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,375
someone who would support

295
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,208
and obey my decisions
without question

296
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,583
someone who was willing
to trust my judgment

297
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,333
and that someone was Will Riker.

298
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,917
Without his loyalty,
none of us would have survived.

299
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,166
(<i> groaning</i> )

300
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,583
What's wrong?

301
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,125
I think I
busted a rib.

302
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,834
Excuse me.

303
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,250
What were you doing?

304
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,750
I was doing<i> bat'leth</i> 
moves with Mr. Worf.

305
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,458
I jabbed when
I should have blocked.

306
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,417
He caught me right
in the side.

307
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:27,542
It's a good thing we
were using the sticks

308
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,000
instead of
the real blades.

309
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,625
It's broken, all right.

310
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,750
Give him ten cc's
of terakine

311
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,917
for the pain.

312
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:35,417
I can't believe
how stupid I was.

313
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,542
You both must
have gotten

314
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,208
a little carried
away, that's all.

315
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,458
No, it was my fault.

316
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,208
I got distracted
at a crucial moment.

317
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,750
It can happen to anyone.

318
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,750
I knew what I was supposed
to do and I didn't do it.

319
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,875
If those had been
real<i> bat'leths</i>

320
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,458
I might be dead right now.

321
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,542
There, all better.

322
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,375
Will, it's all right.

323
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,125
You made a mistake.
No harm done.

324
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,333
You'll be
better next time.

325
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,291
Yeah. Maybe.

326
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,083
Scan of grid 157
is complete.

327
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,333
I am moving
to grid 158.

328
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,250
The Romulan warship is
still searching grid 270.

329
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,834
They're sure spending
a lot of time over there.

330
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,208
I wonder if they...?
LA FORGE:
Commander,

331
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,834
I think we might
have just struck pay dirt.

332
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,542
There's a subspace
resonance signature

333
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,834
coming from that asteroid.

334
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,375
From the frequency variances

335
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,917
it looks like the pattern
of a Federation warp core.

336
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,625
Captain Picard
to the bridge.

337
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,125
Take us to within
ten kilometers

338
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,375
of asteroid
gamma 601.

339
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,041
Geordi's found
something.

340
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,500
There's a subspace
resonance signature

341
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,709
coming from
that asteroid.

342
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,750
It could be the warp core
of the<i> Pegasus.</i>

343
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,000
I think he's right.

344
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,125
I recognize some of
the variance patterns.

345
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,125
Put the asteroid
on the main viewscreen.

346
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,500
DATA:
I have confirmed
Geordi's readings.

347
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,041
The resonance signature
is originating

348
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,417
from somewhere beneath
the asteroid's surface.

349
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,083
Beneath the surface?
How is that possible?

350
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,083
The asteroid contains
several deep chasms

351
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,083
large enough
for a starship to enter.

352
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,667
It is possible
the<i> Pegasus</i> drifted

353
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,709
into the asteroid's
gravitational field

354
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,000
and was pulled down
into one of the fissures.

355
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,041
Sir, the Romulan warbird

356
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,625
has altered course
once again.

357
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,250
They are heading
toward our position.

358
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,417
They probably want to see

359
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:30,917
what we're so interested
in over here.

360
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:33,375
Mr. Data, how long
will it take

361
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,583
to determine the location
of the<i> Pegasus?</i>

362
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
At least another
six hours, sir.

363
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,875
That's too long.

364
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,417
If the Romulans start
searching the asteroid

365
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,917
they could find the
ship before we do.

366
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,959
I recommend we destroy
the asteroid.

367
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,375
It would take most
of our photon torpedoes

368
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,083
but it would preclude
any possibility

369
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,208
of the<i> Pegasus</i> falling
into Romulan hands.

370
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,709
Our top priority
is to salvage the
ship, Commander.

371
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:57,125
I'll consider destroying
it only as a last resort.

372
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,417
Yes, sir.

373
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,041
Captain...

374
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,500
could you give me
a third alternative?

375
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,917
Mr. Data, would it be possible

376
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:08,709
to saturate the asteroid
with Verteron Particles?

377
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,625
That would mask
the resonance signature

378
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,000
and prevent the Romulans
from detecting it.

379
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,750
In order for the deception
to succeed

380
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,041
it would have to appear
to be a natural phenomenon.

381
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,291
Verteron Particles
are artificial in nature.

382
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,083
Wait a minute.
We can blanket the asteroid

383
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,208
with high levels
of ionizing radiation.

384
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,709
There's so much of it
in the system already

385
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,375
the Romulans won't know
the difference.

386
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,625
Mr. Data?

387
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,750
Theoretically, sir,
it should work.

388
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,750
If we do this,
we have to do it fast.

389
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,458
The Romulans will be
within sensor range

390
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,834
in less than a minute.

391
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,291
Make it so, Mr. Data.

392
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,834
Aye, sir.

393
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,917
Initiating ionization
field pulse.

394
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:45,500
When he's finished,
we'll have to move away

395
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,542
and make it look as if
we've scanned the asteroid

396
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:49,083
but haven't found anything.

397
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,417
Lay in a course
for the next search grid.

398
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:51,834
Stand by to engage.

399
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,917
If it works, the Romulans
won't find anything

400
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,792
and we can return later.

401
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:57,083
If it doesn't...

402
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,417
If it doesn't work
we'll have handed them

403
00:17:58,417 --> 00:17:59,709
the<i> Pegasus.</i>

404
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,166
Ionization pulse
complete.

405
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,792
Helm, one quarter impulse.

406
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,291
Engage.

407
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,208
The Romulans
are initiating

408
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,208
a tachyon scan
of the asteroid.

409
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,667
They have switched to
their lateral sensor array.

410
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,875
Beginning another scan.

411
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,458
They're certainly
being thorough.

412
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,375
DATA:
The warbird has completed
its sensor sweep.

413
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,500
If they found
the resonance signature

414
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,000
they should be sending
away teams any second.

415
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,458
DATA:
They are moving out.

416
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,875
Mr. Data, we must convince
the Romulans

417
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,959
that we're still
looking for the<i> Pegasus.</i>

418
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:48,959
I want you
to continue

419
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,208
scanning this system.

420
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,875
Aye, sir.

421
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,834
I want to be back at this
asteroid at 0800 hours tomorrow.

422
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,166
Plan your search
pattern accordingly.

423
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,041
Aye, sir.

424
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,250
Admiral, would you care
to join me for some late dinner?

425
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,500
Please excuse me, Captain

426
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,917
but I think I'd better
turn in early.

427
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,458
You have the bridge,
Number One.

428
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,542
Oh, and will you bring
the scan analysis

429
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,542
to my quarters when
you're off watch?

430
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:12,834
Aye, sir.

431
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,041
Initiate search
of grid 163.

432
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,291
Beginning sensor sweeps.

433
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,834
Commander, I want to
see you in the
captain's ready room.

434
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:22,959
Mr. Data, you have
the bridge.

435
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,417
Aye, sir.

436
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,542
What the hell is
the matter with you?

437
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:34,041
Destroy the<i> Pegasus</i> before
we've even taken a look at it?

438
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,542
I thought it was
more important
that the Romulans...

439
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,083
Well, you were wrong!

440
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,333
We have a chance here
to change

441
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,667
the balance
of power in this quadrant

442
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:41,959
but we can't
very well do that

443
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:45,000
if we destroy the<i> Pegasus,</i> 
now, can we?

444
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,375
No, sir.

445
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,083
It hasn't been easy
for you, I'm sure

446
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,208
keeping your captain
and friends

447
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,333
in the dark like this.

448
00:19:56,333 --> 00:20:00,208
I haven't enjoyed it,
if that's what you mean.

449
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,250
I hope you understand
that it's necessary.

450
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,792
I understand that<i> you</i> 
think it's necessary.

451
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,583
You<i> have</i> changed.

452
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,458
Changed?

453
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,792
Something the captain
and I were talking about.

454
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,667
To be honest, I'm glad to see

455
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,625
this kind of change
in you, Will.

456
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:28,041
State your opinion
and stand by it.

457
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,333
It's a far cry
from the young man

458
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,667
who used to sit at my helm

459
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:33,166
and worry about pressing
the wrong button.

460
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,375
A lot of things can change
in 12 years,<i> Admiral.</i>

461
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,750
Yes, they can.

462
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,291
But it's important
that a man changes

463
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,208
the right things in his life--

464
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:47,250
not his sense of duty,
not his sense of loyalty.

465
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,709
I'd like to think that I haven't
changed those things, sir.

466
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,959
I would like
to think that, too

467
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,792
because those things
say more about a man

468
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:58,041
than the rank on his collar
or the uniform he wears.

469
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,667
They define him.

470
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:08,667
12 years ago, a lot of older
and more seasoned officers

471
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,750
turned away from their duty

472
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,583
but you stood up
for what was right.

473
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,291
I'm sorry, Will.

474
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,542
I know the kind
of man you are.

475
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,375
I know that I can
count on you again.

476
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,000
(<i> door chimes</i> )

477
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,333
Come.

478
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,291
The scan analysis
you asked for.

479
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,083
Thank you.

480
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,375
(<i> sighs</i> )

481
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,000
Is there something else, sir?

482
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,875
Yes, there is.

483
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,583
"Judge Advocate General's
report, Stardate 36764.

484
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,667
"Subject: inquiry into mutiny

492
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:13,917
Mutiny?

493
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,291
On a Federation
starship?

494
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,583
That's shocking,
it's unthinkable.

495
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,875
And yet you've never
mentioned it.

496
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,834
No, sir.

497
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:27,875
You know, it wasn't easy
to get this report.

498
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,542
I had to pull in
quite a few favors at Starfleet

499
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:31,917
just to get a look at it.

500
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,917
It seems that
it was classified

501
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:38,250
by Starfleet
Intelligence.

502
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,083
So...

503
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:47,834
not only...
was the<i> Pegasus</i>

504
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,000
carrying sensitive equipment

505
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,792
which must not be allowed
to fall into Romulan hands,

506
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:55,041
not only was there
a mysterious explosion

507
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,458
which seemed to destroy
the ship,

508
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,792
but<i> didn't...</i>

509
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:02,125
but it seems that there
was a mutiny on board.

510
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,542
Now, I've read
the official report

511
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:07,000
of the inquiry
on that mutiny

512
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,333
but I want to know
your version of what happened.

513
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,208
I was on the bridge.

514
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,500
The ship was at
yellow alert.

515
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:21,959
We were running some tests
on the engines.

516
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,250
Something went wrong.

517
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,542
There was an explosion
in engineering.

518
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,291
Heavy casualties.

519
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:29,625
In the midst of this crisis

520
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,500
the first officer,
the chief of engineering

521
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,667
and most of the bridge crew

522
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,959
mutinied against
Captain Pressman.

523
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,291
Why?

524
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,291
They thought he
was jeopardizing the ship.

525
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,709
And you?

526
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,625
I was seven months
out of the academy

527
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:45,792
my head still ringing
with words like

528
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,083
"duty" and "honor."

529
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,166
when they turned on him

530
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,792
I thought they were a bunch of
self-serving, disloyal officers

531
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:59,834
so I grabbed a phaser
and I defended my captain.

532
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:06,083
Two or three others joined us,
but it was clear by then

533
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,333
that the mutineers had
most of the crew behind them.

534
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:14,125
We felt a need
to get off the ship.

535
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,542
There was a running firefight

536
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,667
all the way
to the escape pod.

537
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:21,792
About five minutes
after we left the ship...

538
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:23,083
there was an explosion.

539
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:32,291
"The judge advocate
also believes

540
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:35,166
"that the surviving officers

541
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,041
"withholding vital information
from this inquiry.

542
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,208
Further investigation
is recommended."

543
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:42,250
Will, there was
no further investigation.

544
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,291
This report was classified,
and then it was quietly buried.

545
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,500
Why?

546
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,166
Sir, may I suggest
you take this up with Admiral...

547
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,375
I'm taking this up
with you, Will!

548
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,959
The judge advocate thought

549
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,875
that you were participating
in a conspiracy

550
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:01,500
to cover up the truth.

551
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,166
Now, what the hell
is going on here, Will?

552
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,917
Why did that mutiny happen?

553
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:08,250
Why is Pressman
so determined

554
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,583
to find your ship
12 years later?

555
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:13,500
I've said all I can.

556
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,792
I'm under direct orders
from Admiral Pressman

557
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:18,208
not to discuss this, sir.

558
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:21,250
Very well.

559
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,083
He's an admiral.
I'm a captain.

560
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,875
I cannot force you
to disobey his orders.

561
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:35,709
Therefore, I will have to remain
in the dark on this mission.

562
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,625
And I will
just have to trust

563
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,709
that you will not
let Pressman put this ship

564
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:42,125
at unnecessary risk.

565
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,667
And if I find that that trust

566
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,083
has been misplaced,
then I will have to reevaluate

567
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,875
the command structure
of this ship.

568
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,291

Mr. Data, report.

593
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,500
For the past several hours

594
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,083
I have been scanning
the area where we

595
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,667
detected the resonance
signature of the<i> Pegasus.</i>

596
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:02,083
From the strength and polarity
of the signature

597
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,875
it would appear that most of
the warp core is still intact.

598
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,625
If we're lucky, the entire
engineering section

599
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,792
could be down there.

600
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,917
But how do we get to it?

601
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:11,208
I wouldn't want to
try to transport

602
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,542

603
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,166
Agreed.

604
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,750
What about a shuttle?

605
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,500
We could send it down
through one of those fissures.

606
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,333
I would recommend
against it, sir.

607
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,792
There may be gravimetric
or magnetic fluctuations

608
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,375
inside the asteroid

609
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,709
which would overpower
the engines of a shuttlecraft.

610
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:28,834
Sounds like the best solution
is to take the<i> Enterprise</i> in.

611
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:32,959
Into the asteroid?

612
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,500
That's right.

Put this fissure
on the main viewer.

614
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:42,333
This chasm is large enough
for us to maneuver in.

615
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:44,291
Besides, if we ever hope
to salvage the<i> Pegasus</i>

616
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,750
we're going to need
a starship to do it.

617
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,333
Mr. Data?

618
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:51,375
It is theoretically
possible, sir,
but I am unaware

619
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,500
of any prior situations
where a starship

620
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,208
was taken so deeply
inside a planetary body.

621
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,500
There may be
unforeseen
difficulties.

622
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,625
Admiral, I don't think
that we can risk...

623
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,291
I've made my decision.

624
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:04,458
Prepare to take
the<i> Enterprise</i> in, Captain.

625
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,208

that this action is being taken
over my explicit objection?

629
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,417
It is so noted, sir.

Take us in.

637
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:03,500
We are now two kilometers
beneath the surface.

638
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,125
Captain, we are
encountering shifts

639
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,500
in the magnetic
field density.

640
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,834
Admiral, if this passage

641
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:17,709
narrows to less
than 500 meters

642
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:19,417
I will abort
the mission.

643
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:21,709
You can charge me with
insubordination if you wish

644
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:23,125
but I'm not going
to risk the<i> Enterprise</i>

645
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,333
for a salvage operation.

646
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,125

sensors show the ship
is still intact.

651
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:52,125
However, 65% of it is
contained within the asteroid.

652
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,375
It looks
as if half the ship

653
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,875
materialized
inside solid rock.

654
00:29:56,875 --> 00:30:00,834
Yes, sir. I do not understand
how this could have happened.

655
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,458
Let's keep the speculation
to a minimum.

656
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,291
We have to begin
the salvage operation.

657
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:08,250
The equipment we need
was in main engineering.

658
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,291
Can you scan that section
of the<i> Pegasus?</i>

659
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:13,000
The starboard bulkhead
of main engineering

660
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,375
is contained
within the rock face

661
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:18,959
but most of its compartment
is still intact.

662
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,875
There is a hull breach
in that section.

663
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,709
If we begin
a power transfer

664
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:25,583
can we restore
life-support systems

665
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,000
to that compartment?

666
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,500
I believe so, sir.

667
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,542
The breach can be
temporarily sealed

668
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:31,750
by extending
our shields.

669
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,291
See to it.

00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,792
Yes, sir.

678
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:12,625
This room was open
to space for 12 years.

I kept hoping
it wouldn't be here...

690

that it had been destroyed...

691
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,166
that it was buried
in that rock back there.

692
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:24,166
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

693
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,625
It means that I can't
put this off any longer.

And, Admiral...

697

You had better reconsider
that position, Commander.

00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,458
We have a mission

702
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:51,875

to carry it out.

Keep your self-righteous
comments to yourself.

708
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,208
I knew most of these people
a lot longer than you did.

709
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,208
Yes, it was tragic,
but it was their fault.

710
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:13,208
You don't know that.

711
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:15,291
Neither of us knows
what happened after we left.

712
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:17,500
Well, it's not
hard to guess.

713
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,709
They tried to shut down

714
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:20,166
an experiment
they didn't understand.

715
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,750
Something went wrong,
and it killed them.

716
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,583
No, we killed them.

717
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,083
Now, that doesn't sound like
the same man

718
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,333
who grabbed a phaser

719
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,792
and defended his captain
12 years ago.

720
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,917
I've had 12 years
to think about it.

721
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:38,166
And if I had it
to do over again

722
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,375
I would have grabbed the phaser

723
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:41,333
and pointed it at you,
instead of them.

724
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,917
So, on reflection

725
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:46,583
you'd rather be a
traitor than a hero.

726
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:49,667
I wasn't a hero,
and neither were you.

727
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,291
What you did was wrong,
and I was wrong to support you

728
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:55,750
but I was too young and too
stupid to realize it.

729
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,875
You were the captain,
I was the ensign.

730
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,875
I was just following orders.

731
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,083
And if you hadn't,
you'd be dead right now

732
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,834
along with all
the rest of them.

733
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:06,000
Dead because you listened
to a bunch of mutinous cowards

734
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,834
who were too blinded by fear
to see what I was trying to do.

735
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:11,125
They were brave enough
to risk their lives

736
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,083
to stop you
from violating a treaty

737
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,667
the Federation signed
in good faith.

738
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,834
That treaty has bound our hands
and given the Romulans

739
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:21,542
a tactical advantage
for the last 60 years.

740
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,750
I was simply trying
to level the playing field.

741
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,250
And now you want
to try it again.

742
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,583
How many people will die
this time--

743
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:30,875
50, 100, 1,000?

744
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:33,333
All right, you don't want
to help me, fine.

745
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,792
But you are still
under my direct orders

746
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,500
not to talk about
what you know

747
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,583
and I expect you to follow
those orders to the letter.

748
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:39,834
I made you, mister

749
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:41,500
and I can break you
just as easily.

750
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,417
Do you understand
me, Commander?

751
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,375
Picard to away team.

752
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,959
Prepare to return
to the ship immediately.

753
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:51,792
Stand by,<i> Enterprise.</i>

754
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,333
Pressman to<i> Enterprise.</i>

755
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:00,333
Two people and one piece
of equipment to beam up.

756
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,750
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

757
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:16,000
Report.

758
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,417
The Romulans have destroyed
the entrance to the chasm

759
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,750
with their disruptors.

760
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,000
They've sealed
us in.

761
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,959
WORF:
Sir, there is
an incoming message.

762
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,625
It is from the warbird.

763
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:39,792
On screen.

764
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:41,250
Aye, sir.

765
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,291
Captain, you seem to be

766
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:46,083
in a very unfortunate
circumstance.

767
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:47,083
How can we help?

768
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,542
Are you responsible for this?

769
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:50,166
I'm not sure.

770
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:53,291
We were conducting
some geological experiments

771
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,208
on the surface
of the asteroid.

772
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,583
It is entirely possible

773
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:59,625
that we accidentally
sealed you in.

774
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,875
If only we had known
you were beneath the surface--

775
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:04,208
if you had shared
your plans with us--

776
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,792
this might
have been avoided.

777
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,458
What do you want, Sirol?

778
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,709
I don't want
anything, Captain,

779
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,000
but I will offer to help you.

780
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,417
How?

781
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:14,500
By transporting

782
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,083
your crew aboard my ship.

783
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,834
We'll take you
back to Romulus

784
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:22,000
where, after a short stay
as our guests

785
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,542
you will be returned
to the Federation.

786
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,834
Thank you
for your generous offer.

787
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:29,583
I will take it
under advisement.

788
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:31,166
As you wish.

789
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:34,458
We will be continuing
our research in this system

790
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,917
for a while longer.

791
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,458
I await your decision.

792
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,458
We can't do it.

793
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:41,959
If we abandon
the<i> Enterprise</i>

794
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,208
they'll come back here
and get their hands

795
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,291
on both ships.

796
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:46,166
Agreed. Options?

797
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:47,750
WORF:
Captain, I believe
we could use

798
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,583
the phasers to cut our way out.

799
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,792
The asteroid's internal
structure is highly unstable.

800
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:54,917
Any attempt to cut
through the rock could cause

801
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:57,125
the entire chasm
to collapse.

802
00:36:57,125 --> 00:37:00,834
Captain, I have
a suggestion.

803
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,500
There's a piece of equipment
in Admiral Pressman's quarters

804
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,166
under guard that might
get us out of here.

805
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:10,041
It's a prototype for
a Federation cloaking device.

806
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,959
You just ended
your career, Will.

807
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,250
That's what it's about.

808
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:22,500
A cloaking device.

809
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,333
In the Treaty of Algeron

810
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,208
the Federation
specifically agreed

811
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,375
not to develop
cloaking technology.

812
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:31,792
And that treaty is
the biggest mistake
we ever made.

813
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,709
It's kept us from
exploiting a vital
area of defense.

814
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:38,250
That treaty has kept us
in peace for 60 years--

815
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,542
and, as a Starfleet officer,
you're supposed to uphold it.

816
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:44,417
Now, that's enough!

817
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:46,125
I'm taking command
of this vessel.

818
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:50,000
Mr. Worf, escort the captain
to his quarters.

819
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,125
I don't think
anyone's going to

820
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,625
come to your defense
this time.

821
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:07,041
How do we use
the cloak to escape

822
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:09,333
from the asteroid?

823
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,959
It's more than just a cloak.

824
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:13,834
It changes the structure
of matter.

825
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:16,000
In theory,
a ship using this device

826
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,375
could pass through
normal matter.

827
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,208
I see why you were
so eager to find it.

828
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,917
Then, can't you see
the potential here?

829
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,834
The phasing cloak could be
the greatest breakthrough

830
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:28,417
in weapons research
in the last 50 years.

831
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:30,166
Except that it's illegal.

832
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:31,750
It's in violation
of an agreement

833
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,875
that the Federation
signed in good faith.

834
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:37,125
Captain, I think we could
adapt the cloak

835
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:38,500
for the<i> Enterprise.</i>

836
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,583
Mr. Data?

837
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,959
Theoretically,
it is possible, sir

838
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:46,667
but it would take several hours
to study the device

839
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,542
and determine how to link it
to our systems.

840
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:49,917
Make it so.

841
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:55,792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47457.1.</i>

842
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,375
<i>We have been trapped</i>
<i>inside the asteroid</i>

843
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,208
<i>for over eight hours.</i>

844
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:02,291
<i>Mr. Data and Commander La Forge</i>
<i>inform me</i>

845
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,834
<i>that they are nearly ready</i>
<i>to engage the cloak.</i>

846
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:10,500
Commander, we've routed
the impulse engines

847
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,125
through the plasma conduits

848
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:14,583
but you're going to have
to watch the intercooler levels.

849
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:15,792
If they get too high

850
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:17,625
we'll blow the entire
relay system.

851
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,250
RIKER:
Understood.

852
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:22,917
I think that's what happened
12 years ago.

853
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,709
The cloak blew out
the plasma relays

854
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:27,291
on the<i> Pegasus</i> 
after we left the ship.

855
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:30,250
The plasma ignited in space,
and it looked

856
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,208
as if the ship
had been destroyed.

857
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:35,000
So the ship drifted
into this system

858
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,750
still in a phased state

859
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,333
and when it passed
through this asteroid...

860
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,208
The cloak failed.

861
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:45,166
And half of the ship
materialized in solid rock.

862
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,583
La Forge to bridge.

863
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,875
The cloak is on line

864
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,041
and ready to begin
phase sequencing.

865
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:51,333
Proceed, Number One.

866
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,542
Aye, sir.

867
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:54,166
Activating power systems.

868
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,959
Report.

869
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,834
The cloak appears to be
functioning normally.

870
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:11,792
The ship's matter/energy
phasing rate

871
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,667
should be sufficient
to pass through the asteroid.

872
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:15,667
Take us out.

873
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,000
Maneuvering thrusters only.

874
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,166
WORF:
Aye, sir.

875
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,000
We will reach the rock face
in five seconds.

876
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,583
We have passed through
two kilometers

877
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:47,166
of the asteroid.

878
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,750
Now within one kilometer
of the surface.

879
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,000
We're approaching
the surface.

880
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:03,166
We have cleared
the asteroid, Captain.

881
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:04,875
The warbird is off
the port bow.

to make up our minds.

Disengage the cloaking device,
Commander.

884
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:11,959
You cannot do that!

885
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:13,500
If the Romulans see us
decloaking, they'll...

886
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,583
They'll know
the truth, Admiral!

887
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:18,667
Which is what everyone
will know very shortly.

888
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:20,291
Carry out my orders.

889
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:32,125
Mr. Worf,
send a message to the warbird.

890
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,583
Inform them that
their government

891
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,291
will be contacted shortly
about this incident.

892
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:36,375
Aye, sir.

893
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:40,166
Admiral,
I am hereby charging you

894
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:42,083
with violation of
the Treaty of Algeron.

895
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,417
As captain of the<i> Enterprise,</i> 
I'm placing you under arrest.

896
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:46,542
Mr. Worf?

897

Admiral, if you
will come with me.

Captain...

899
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,917
I'll have to be
placed under arrest as well.

900
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,041
Admiral.

901
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,166
I have a lot
of friends

902
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,166
at Starfleet
Command, Captain.

903
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:07,291
You're going to need them.

905
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:33,125
I've spoken with
fleet Admiral Shanthi.

906
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:36,458
There will be a full inquiry
once we reach Starbase 247

907
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:38,125
and that will probably lead

908
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:41,000
to a general court-martial
of Admiral Pressman

909
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
and several others
at Starfleet Intelligence.

910
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,709
Your involvement
in this affair

911
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:48,959
is going to be thoroughly
investigated, Will.

912
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,959
There'll be some hard
questions for you to answer.

913
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:52,291
I understand.

914
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:04,542
You made a mistake
12 years ago

915
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:05,750
but your service
since then

916
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,458
has earned you
a great deal of respect

917
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:10,542
but this incident could cost
you some of that respect.

918
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:13,166
I can't help but feel
that I should have

919
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:15,083
come forward
a long time ago.

920
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:17,250
But when the moment came
to make a decision

921
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,625
you made the right one.

922
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:22,625
You chose to tell the truth
and face the consequences.

923
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,542
As long as you can
still do that

924
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:28,208
then you deserve
to wear that uniform.

925
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,291
And I will still be proud

926
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:31,000
to have you
as my first officer.
