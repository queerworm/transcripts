2
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:07,959
They found Data's head
a mile beneath San Francisco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,709
Been down there
about five centuries.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,250
At some future date

5
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,625
I will be transported back
to 19th-century Earth,

6
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:16,792
where I will die.

7
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,333
It has occurred.

8
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,083
It will occur.

9
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,375
Do I know you, Mr...

10
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:27,500
Data.

11
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:30,625
Yes. We were on
a ship together.

12
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:31,750
The<i> Enterprise.</i>

13
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,500
Is that a clipper ship?

14
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:35,667
It is a starship.

15
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:37,083
Starship?

16
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:50,208
RIKER:
My God.

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,083
They're delivering more of them
for the others to ingest.

18
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,667
Did my father
send you here?

19
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:56,000
Because if he did,
you must go back

20
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,417
and tell him I'm not
done listening...

21
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,208
I was not sent
by your father.

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,500
Our ship encountered
a species

23
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:04,917
who appears to be threatening
19th-century Earth.

24
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,500
I'm not willing to accept
that he's dead

25
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:07,750
and just leave it at that.

26
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,500
We cannot make
Mr. Data our priority.

27
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:11,542
What is more
important than Data?

28
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,375
Do you remember
the first time we met?

29
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:14,709
Of course.

30
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,125
Don't be so sure.

31
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,458
If you don't go
on this mission,

32
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,458
we'll never meet.

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,250
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

34
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,458
SAMUEL CLEMENS:
I've long been interested
in the notion of time travelers.

35
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,667
In fact, I wrote a book
about it.

36
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,750
It chronicles the tale
of a man of our era

37
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:51,125
who fouls the sixth century by
introducing newfangled gadgets

38
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:55,375
and weapons, all in
the name of<i> progress.</i>

39
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:56,291
But, uh...

40
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,583
(<i> spits</i> )

41
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:01,458
But this, uh, idea
of time travel--

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,542
not so farfetched
as it might seem.

43
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:08,041
In fact, I have just
learned that even now

44
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,583
there are people
from the future

45
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,792
right here in San Francisco,

46
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:17,583
and I have no doubt that their
intent is to foul our world

47
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,333
just like my Yankee did
in King Arthur's time.

48
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,500
Well, sir, let me
serve notice.

49
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,875
As soon as I have
the necessary evidence

50
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:27,667
I intend to expose them

51
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,583
and make it absolutely clear
that they are not welcome here.

52
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,500
Yes, sir,
and will this be a sequel

53
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:35,750
to<i> Connecticut Yankee,</i>
Mr. Twain?

54
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,625
Name is Clemens, boy.

55
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,750
Sam Clemens.

56
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,583
That's with an "E."

57
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,208
With an "E."

58
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,500
Got it.

59
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,792
Excuse me.

60
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:44,208
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

61
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,458
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,291
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

63
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:54,083
<i>to explore</i>

65
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:02,875
<i>to boldly go</i>

66
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,750
RIKER:
The coroner said

67
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:03,500
this is where they kept
all the cholera victims.

68
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:04,959
It doesn't make sense

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,542
that so many people
are dying of cholera.

70
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:11,750
It just isn't that virulent.

71
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:17,125
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

72
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,583
Will.

73
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,041
This is strange.

74
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,166
What is it?

75
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,417
The cerebellum,
the cerebral cortex,

76
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,959
the brain stem,
the entire nervous system

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,709
has been depleted
of electrochemical energy.

78
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,250
Here's another one.

79
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,583
Same neural depletion.

80
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,959
These people
did not die of cholera.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,542
They died because their neural
energy was drained somehow.

82
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,000
Drained?

83
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:03,291
And taken to Devidia II
for those aliens to ingest?

84
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,250
If you were a time traveler

85
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,917
with a taste
for human neural energy,

86
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,375
where would you get
your supply?

87
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,542
I would travel
back to a time

88
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,542
when there were plagues
and epidemics,

89
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:20,125
so I could murder and use
the disease as a cover.

90
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,000
Over half of the victims

91
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,417
whose neural energy
have been drained

92
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,500
came from
the Sisters of Hope Infirmary.

93
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:34,291
RIKER: The charity hospital
near the waterfront.

94
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,959
If the aliens have been
killing people there,

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,542
well, someone might have
noticed something unusual.

96
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,959
And if they're moving
among humans,

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,792
then they must have taken on
human form.

98
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,375
But the question is how do we
know who we're looking for?

99
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,458
The tricorder indicated
triolic activity

100
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
from most of the bodies
we've looked at.

101
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,709
If the aliens left
that sort of signature,

102
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,208
they'll be detectable.

103
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,625
You know, we might
even be able

104
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:56,083
to rig some kind
of alien alarm system.

105
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,250
Any luck contacting Data?

106
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,542
None. Tricorder's broadcasting
random emissions

107
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,000
on all frequencies
his subprocessors might pick up,

108
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,709
but the range is limited.

109
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,750
Almost anything
could interfere.

110
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,041
(<i> knocking</i> )

111
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:12,542
She's back.

112
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,125
MRS. CARMICHAEL:
Mr. Picard?

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,542
(<i> knocking</i> )

114
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,375
Yes, Mrs. Carmichael?

115
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,208
Mr. Picard,

116
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,542
I'll be reminding you
that it's 1:00.

117
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,792
Yes.

118
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,792
1:00 on a Thursday.

119
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:36,250
I'm sure I made
it clear to you

120
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,875
that the rent is always
due, payable in full,

121
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,208
by 1:00 on Wednesdays.

122
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,000
Ah, yes.

123
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,000
Uh... the rent.

124
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,083
Uh, Mrs. Carmichael...

125
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,792
even now, my, uh...

126
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:56,834
my troupe are in rehearsals
for a new production.

127
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,125
Oh?

128
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,834
I haven't heard
of any new production.

129
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,333
What play is it?

130
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,208
The play.

131
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:09,083
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

132
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,834
We have performed
in London, Paris,

133
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,041
Milan...

134
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,917
Milan, to sold out houses.

135
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,333
I can assure you

136
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,375
you will have the rent in full,
with a bonus.

137
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,291
Oh, no, no, no, no.

138
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:26,834
I've heard you
silver-tongued
devils before.

139
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,458
I'll have my rent
in full tomorrow by 1:00

140
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,417
or you'll be out
performing on the street.

141
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:35,500
(<i> door closes</i> )

142
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:41,625
I wouldn't do this for
just anyone, Mr. Clemens,

143
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:44,250
and I hope you won't spread
it around that I let you in.

144
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,542
You know, people
start talking.

145
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,000
Of course not, Jack.

146
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,500
And I assure you
that Mr. Data

147
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,709
would be most upset
if you didn't.

148
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,083
If I can't find

149
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,166
that letter of intent
that he left me,

150
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,959
our major investor
is going to pull out

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,208
and take his business
elsewhere.

152
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,417
It has to do

153
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,417
with Mr. Data's
engine, doesn't it?

154
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,417
Engine?

155
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,583
Well, yes.

156
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,583
Oh, yes...

157
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,709
Yes...

158
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,875
This is exactly
what it's all about.

159
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,041
Ow!

160
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,333
You know, Mr. Clemens,

161
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,417
I'm going to do you
another favor today.

162
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,542
You're always looking
for good stories, right?

163
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,875
Mm-hmm.

164
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,125
Well, I've got
a real humdinger for you.

165
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,458
The, uh, story of my life.

166
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,333
Now, I know you
may think I'm young,

167
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,667
but I've covered
a lot of ground

168
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:28,583
and, if I do say so myself

169
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,500
it'd make for some pretty
fascinating reading.

170
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:33,041
So, uh, what do you think?

171
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,166
About what?

172
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,875
About writing my life story.

173
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:38,000
You and me--

174
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,083
literary partners,
of course.

175
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:45,000
Young man, I have a maxim
that I have always lived by.

176
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,709
No one is more qualified
to write your story

177
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,667
than you are.

178
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:50,709
Me, be a writer?

179
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,625
You think I
could do that?

180
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,208
Long as you write
about what you know.

181
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,834
You got any passions, boy?
Any dreams?

182
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,875
Well, I'd like to do
some traveling,

183
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:00,875
maybe go to sea.

184
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:02,291
And Alaska.

185
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,208
I've had the strangest notion
to go see Alaska.

186
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,667
That's a great idea, son!

187
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:07,333
That's exactly
what I would do

188
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,750
if I were your age.

189
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,667
Alaska, the Klondike,
the Aurora Borealis...

190
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,083
That's it!

191
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,875
Follow your dreams,
and write about them.

192
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,250
Thank you, Mr. Clemens.

193
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,625
You know, that is exactly
what I'm going to do.

194
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:20,709
You do that, son.

195
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,000
You'll see my name
in print, too.

196
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,458
I'm sure I will.

197
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,834
And don't forget-- the name's
London. Jack London.

198
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,875
Good-bye, now.

199
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,959
Bye-bye.

200
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,709
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

201
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,125
(<i> outside door closes</i> )

202
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,875
(<i> footsteps and voices</i>
<i>approaching</i> )

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,750
I found the head surveyor.

204
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,291
I found the cavern.

205
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,125
You will not be able
to get to it.

206
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,166
The entrance
is on a mine shaft

207
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,458
that is in the middle
of the Presidio

208
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,959
on an army base.

209
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,583
Perhaps you could arrange
for us to get in.

210
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,083
(<i> scoffs</i> ):
How?

211
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,792
With permission to dig
for the mine shaft.

212
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,875
Oh, now, Data,
I've done everything...

213
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,000
I have full confidence

214
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,208
in your persuasive
abilities.

215
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,709
Well, I suppose
it's more interesting

216
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,834
than throwing a tea dance.

217
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,333
Strange--

218
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,959
the transceiver assembly
has been removed.

219
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,291
Without it, I will be unable
to track the time shifts.

220
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:35,834
Twain.

221
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,083
Clemens?

222
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,333
Yes.

223
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,041
He's been driving me crazy.

224
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,917
He watches the house.

225
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,500
He follows me down the street
asking me questions.

226
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:47,542
If anyone took this,
you can believe it was him.

227
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,834
If you are correct,
he must be warned.

228
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,834
The device has been
modified in such a way

229
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,834
that prolonged contact
with human tissue

230
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,083
would be highly toxic.

231
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,083
(<i> clattering</i> )

232
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,583
(<i> sheepish grunt</i> )

233
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,917
Madam Guinan, Mr. Data.

234
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,291
Shame on you,
Mr. Clemens. Shame.

235
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,291
Shame, madam?
I think not.

236
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,166
I find no shame in my efforts

237
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,625
to uncover your plot!

238
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,417
I keep telling you
there is no plot.

239
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:41,208
Yes, you do keep
telling me that.

240
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,166
What an interesting pair
you are.

241
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,375
Where in Switzerland

242
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:48,333
did you say you
were from. Mr. Data?

243
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,458
I am French, sir,
not Swiss.

244
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,125
Oh, yes, that's right.

245
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,959
Now, I remember.

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,834
A Frenchman

247
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,417
with a talent for poker,
from what I hear.

248
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,375
You know, I was talking
to a friend of mine,

249
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:02,458
Ches Whitley.

250
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,000
He says to say hello

251
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,750
and wonders
when you're coming back.

252
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,750
I do not believe
I know a Mr. Whitley.

253
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:14,125
No? He works in
the county assayer's office.

254
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,625
He says you've been in there
a number of times

255
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:20,417
claiming to be
a geological engineer

256
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,166
and wanting information

257
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:26,709
about mining operations
during the 1850s.

258
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,000
You remember him now?

259
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,166
I am unfamiliar
with the gentleman's name.

260
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,375
I have spoken to several
people in that office.

261
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:34,417
Yes, I know,

262
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,583
and in the Hall of Records

263
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,250
and in the Geological Society

264
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,500
and in a little-known
mineral shop in Chinatown.

265
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:45,125
You do get around,
don't you?

266
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,166
As apparently you do,
Mr. Clemens.

267
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:52,875
Yes. I must admit
you've got me mystified.

268
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:56,291
This contraption,
for instance.

269
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,333
It's very unusual.

270
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,250
It looks quite futuristic.

271
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,125
Tell me, might it
have something to do

272
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,000
with "time shifts"?

273
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,291
In a sense.

274
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,208
The time shift is
a gearing system
I have invented

275
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,375
for the horseless
carriage.

276
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,125
Ah! Do not
insult me!

277
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,375
You have come here
to this century

278
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:23,834
and brought your infernal
technologies with you

279
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,917
for God only knows
what purpose,

280
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,208
but I have no doubt

281
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,250
it will be the people
of this century

282
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,083
who will suffer for it.

283
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:35,291
My dear Mr. Clemens,
I do think we've heard enough.

284
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,208
Mr. Data's business
is his own

285
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,125
and I will thank you
to leave now.

286
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,792
Pardon me,
Madam Guinan,

287
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,792
but it is my business,
too.

288
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:45,875
It is the business
of all humanity, I believe,

289
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,333
to stop both of you

290
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,417
from whatever it is
you are doing here,

291
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,959
and<i> that</i> is
what I intend to do.

292
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,750
(<i> door slams</i> )

293
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,667
Just what are you doing
with those lamps?

294
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:14,792
Replacing the burners.

295
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,667

Makes it safer
in case of earthquake.

00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,041
There hasn't been

298
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,250
an earthquake here
in 30 years.

299
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, that takes care
of this ward.

300
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,291
Time to be moving on.

301
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,625
Earthquakes.

302
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:38,208
Nurse, if you can
handle things here,

303
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,208
I've got a meeting
with the board of patrons.

304
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,208
I'll try to manage.

00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,125
They've been here recently.

I'd say within
the last 24 hours.

That's the bed where
the man died last night.

311

This man was
complaining

312
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,709
about a strange
doctor and nurse

313
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,417
who visited
that patient.

314
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,750
Perhaps they're still
in the hospital.

he had entered the algid state.

Where'd you
get that?

00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,375
That's
a gentleman's cane.

343
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:00,667
I've never seen
a cane like this.

344

I'll have to confiscate
it for evidence.

00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,417
What the...

360
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,542
LA FORGE:
Those look like

361
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,959
minute distortions
in the space-time continuum

362
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,542
like the one we saw
on Devidia II.

363
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,000
But they were so small and
they lasted only a second.

364
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,125
The aliens appear to be
able to concentrate
the distortion

365
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,208
and direct it to
a specific time and place.

366
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,625
Maybe they have something--
a mechanism that focuses it.

367
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,208
Any device like that
would produce significant levels

368
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,625
of triolic waves,
like the ones in the cavern

369
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:34,959
where Data's head was found.

370
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,542
I have located
that cavern.

371
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,000
(<i> knock on door</i> )

372
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,166
MRS. CARMICHAEL:
Mr. Picard!

373
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:44,166
I know you're in there.
Open the door!

374
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,083
TROI:
Mrs. Carmichael.

375
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,458
"How now, spirit.

376
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,834
Whither wander you?"

377
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,417
"Over hill, over dale,

378
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,041
through bush,
through brier..."

379
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,041
Mrs. Carmichael,
thank goodness you're here.

380
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,041
We need someone
to read a part.

381
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,333
You're just in time.

382
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,125
Mr. Picard, I need
to be talking to you.

383
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,208
CRUSHER:
"...my mistress would
that he be gone."

384
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,166
"Ill-met by moonlight,
proud Titania."

385
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,000
Now, Mrs. Carmichael,
right there.

386
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:11,583
RIKER:
"Ill-met by moonlight,
proud Titania."

387
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,500
(<i> woodenly</i> ):
"What, jealous Oberon?

388
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:21,125
"Fairies skip hence.

389
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:28,041
I have foresworn
his bed and company."

390
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,750
Well, I don't think
I need to hear anymore.

391
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:35,000
That was truly unique.

392
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:35,959
Really?

393
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,166
Ladies and gentlemen,

394
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,083
I think we have found
our Titania.

395
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,166
Don't you agree?

396
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,709
MRS. CARMICHAEL:
Well, I...

397
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,792
I did do a church play
when I was a lass.

398
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:49,041
Well, there you are!

399
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,458
We start rehearsals
tomorrow.

400
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,583
Ohh...

401
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,000
(<i> door opening</i> )

402
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,000
You're back.

403
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,500
I have wonderful news.

404
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:07,166
I've found a way to get
onto the Presidio

405
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,000
and into the mine shaft.

406
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,792
DATA:
It is all right.

407
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,750
Do you know me?

408
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,291
Very well.

409
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,166
Do I know you?

410
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,750
Not yet, but you will.

411
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,834
Thanks for your help,
Officer.

412
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,291
Now be sure to
put in the part

413
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,125
about me spotting
that phony policeman.

414
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,250
Yes, sir, I will.

415
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,667
Hello, son.

416
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:44,667
Mr. Clemens, what
brings you here?

417
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:47,083
Writer's curiosity.

418
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,959
I heard that
two people vanished

419
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,083
into thin air
in this infirmary.

420
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,458
One of the patients
said that, yes, sir

421
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,709
but the police deny it.

422
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,709
I'll bet they do.

423
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,417
They say a band
of outlaws

424
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:03,417
set off an explosion
in the hospital
and then escaped.

425
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,583
Well, what did these
outlaws look like?

426
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,125
The carriage they escaped
in was driven by an albino.

427
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,458
Oh, Mr. Data.

428
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,542
You know him?

429
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,792
Oh, you bet I do.

430
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,250
You say there were
others with him?

431
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,834
Yes, at least a dozen.

432
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:21,917
His accomplices.

433
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,000
They've come from the future.

434
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,959
My God, it's an invasion.

435
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,041
(<i> whistling</i> )

436
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,500
An invasion
from the future?

437
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:29,458
Mr. Clemens, what can
you tell me about this?

438
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,458
Do you have any proof?

439
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,083
When's your deadline, boy?

440
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,458
5:00, sir.

441
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,208
Well, I'll meet you
at your paper at 4:30

442
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,333
with a story that'll
make your career.

443
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,500
Thanks, Mr. Clemens!

444
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:40,917
Take me to
the Presidio, driver,

445
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,083
and don't spare the whip!

446
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,959
DRIVER:
Hyah! Hyah!

447
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,208
The triolic waves
are just as high

448
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,792
as they were on Devidia II,

449
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,166
but there's no indication
of a control mechanism.

450
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,625
I'm not so sure.

451
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:55,834
My visor is picking up
crystalline fractures.

452
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,875
These cavern walls
have undergone

453
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:00,834
some kind of selective
molecular polarization.

454
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,166
In fact, if I'm right,

455
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,375
this entire cavern
has been configured

456
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:07,291
to focus the space-time
distortion...

457
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,125
just like a lens.

458
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,208
Captain.

459
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,667
We think we might be
onto something.

460
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:17,959
The cavern itself seems to be
acting as a focusing mechanism.

461
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,583
I'm willing to bet that it's
the same at their habitat

462
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,000
back on Devidia II.

463
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,583
If we can get back there
and destroy that site,

464
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,625
it might put an end
to their time traveling.

465
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,041
We have the ophidian.

466
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,208
Truthfully, I don't know
that we<i> can</i> get back.

467
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,166
The aliens use triolic energy
as a power source.

468
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,125
The energy that
our phasers generates

469
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,333
might not be
entirely compatible.

470
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,166
We have no choice
but to try.

471
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,583
CLEMENS:
An event I most certainly

472
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,792
would enjoy witnessing.

473
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:45,166
However...

474
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,917
I will regretfully
waive that opportunity

475
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,333
for the privilege

476
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,959
of taking you all
in to the authorities.

477
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,083
Mr. Clemens, it is imperative
that we continue our mission.

478
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:01,166
Mr. Data, I have listened to
your stories and your excuses

479
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,959
and your evasions,
and I will listen no longer!

480
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,458
It is my moral duty
to protect mankind

481
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,709
from whatever devious plan
you have in mind.

482
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,250
Now, move along.

483
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,917
I suspect that
even time travelers

484
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:20,959
are vulnerable
to the Colt .45.

485
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,834
Now, let's go.

486
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,667
I made a young fellow
a promise,

487
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:28,291
and I don't
want to be late.

488
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,333
Uhh!

489
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,041
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

490
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,458
(<i> explosion</i> )

491
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,250
Follow him.

492
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,542
Ow.

493
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:42,542
Is everyone all right?

494
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,792
I think so.

495
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:44,959
You?

496
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,500
Where are we?

497
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:50,166
And when?

498
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,542
This is the 24th century,

499
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,208
we're on Devidia II,

500
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,709
and you're not supposed
to be here.

501
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,208
Well, it seems to me

502
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,834
I have as much right
to be in your time

503
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,750
as you had to be in mine.

504
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:05,041
I wanted to see how you've
conducted my future affairs.

505
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,583
Your future
affairs?

506
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,500
The affairs
of mankind.

507
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,041
But the disappearance
of Mark Twain--

508
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,500
one of the most noted
literary figures

509
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:12,834
of the 19th century...

510
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:13,917
Thank you.

511
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,625
...that's not supposed
to happen.

512
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:19,041
I only took advantage of
an irresistible opportunity,

513
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,917
as any good writer would.

514
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:23,875
WORF:
Bridge to away team.
Acknowledge.

515
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,834
We're here, Mr. Worf.

516
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,750
Stand by to transport five.

517
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,625
LA FORGE:
Commander?

518
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,417
Mr. Worf.

519
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,041
WORF: Yes, Commander.

520
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:44,041
Make that six
to transport.

521
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:53,709
Where are we now?

522
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,667
This is the Federation
Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

523
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:57,000
Ensign, call security.

524
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,083
I want an escort
for this man.

525
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,417
Security?! What for?

526
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:03,291
Are you afraid I'm going
to go around stealing things?

527
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,208
A werewolf!

528
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,625
It's a long story, Mr. Worf.
I'll brief you later.

529
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:12,500
LA FORGE:
Let's have Data's body
taken to the science lab.

530
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:15,125
I'm going to try and
reattach the head we have.

531
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,500
Geordi, that head
is over 500 years old.

532
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:20,291
Yeah, but it's the
best chance we've got.

533
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:23,250
I want Mr. Clemens kept
under escort at all times.

534
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,417
TROI:
Commander,

535
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:27,041
perhaps I could handle that.

536
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:30,583
I'd be happy to take
Mr. Clemens to his quarters.

537
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:31,834
Good idea.

538
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,375
Will you accompany
the counselor?

539
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:38,041
Madam, I'd be delighted.

540
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:41,000
So, this is a spaceship.

541
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:44,417
You ever run into
Halley's comet?

542
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,125
(<i> moans</i> )

543
00:27:57,917 --> 00:27:59,125

(<i> groaning</i> )

545
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:03,375
Now, don't sit up
too quickly.

546
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:07,959
(<i> groaning</i> )

547
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,542
Where'd everybody go?

548
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:13,667
Well, I hope they're
all safely back

549
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:17,041
on the<i> Enterprise</i>
by now.

550
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,083
But you're still here.

551
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:19,417
You were hurt.

552
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:22,166
I had to make sure
you were all right.

553
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:23,792
And so you stayed for that?

554
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:26,542
I didn't want anything
to happen to you.

555
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:30,250
You're far too
important to me.

556
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,208
You know an awful lot
about me.

557
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,917
Well... believe me,
in the future,

558
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:40,333
the tables
will be turned.

559
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:41,875
Do we become friends?

560
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:43,542
Oh...

561
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:47,291
it goes far beyond
friendship.

562
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,125
Oh, but...

563
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:51,208
I'll have to wait
500 years...

564
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,500
Mm-hmm.

565
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:54,208
And when we meet,
I won't even be able

566
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,834
to tell you about this,
will I?

567
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:59,250
No, because, for me,

568
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:01,333
none of this will
have happened yet.

569
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,709
(<i> groans</i> )

570
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,667
Ohh...

571
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,917
What's that?

572
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,041
That's history
fulfilling itself.

573
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh.

574
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:23,583
(<i> quiet conversations</i> )

575
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,625
History has
to fulfill itself.

576
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:27,417
Even Picard knew that.

577
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:29,208
You were there
in the cavern.

578
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,709
You know what happened.

579
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,417
What am I
supposed to do?

580
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,750
If I told you what happened
in that cavern,

581
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:40,542
it might affect
any decision you'd make now.

582
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,667
I can't do that.

583
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:44,750
I won't.

584
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:46,583
<i>Not</i> telling me may
affect my decision.

585
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,250
Did you think of that?

586
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:50,583
We're talking
about Jean-Luc Picard.

587
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:53,792
I can't sit around
and hope it all works out.

588
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,542
I've got to do something!

589
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:09,792
Any place that
doesn't stock
a good cigar

590
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:12,333
doesn't rank high
in my book.

591
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:13,500
If you must have one,

592
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:15,458
I'm sure we can
replicate it for you.

593
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,041
Oh, if you think
that one of these...

594
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:24,333
imitations can take the place
of a hand-wrapped Havana...

595
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,583
I wouldn't know.

596
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,834
Well, that's
the problem I see here.

597
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:30,166
All this technology

598
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:34,125
only serves to take away
life's simple pleasures.

599
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:39,375
You don't even let a man
open the door for a lady.

600
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,333
I think
what we've gained

601
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,375
far outweighs anything
that might have been lost.

602
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:44,792
Oh?

603
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:48,375
Well, I'm not so impressed
with this future--

604
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:51,041
huge starships and weapons

605
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:54,250
that can no doubt
destroy entire cities.

606
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:58,291
Military conquest
as a way of life?

607
00:30:58,333 --> 00:30:59,417
Is that what you see here?

608
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,750
Well, I know
what you say--

609
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:04,000
that this is a vessel
of exploration

610
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:08,458
and that your mission is to
discover new worlds, but...

611
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
(<i> chuckles</i> )

612
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:13,625
but that's what
the Spanish said.

613
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:14,792
Deck 36.

614
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:17,417
And the Dutch
and the Portuguese.

615
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,291
It's what all conquerors say.

616
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,834
I'm sure that's what
you told that... that...

617
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,417
blue-skinned fellow I just saw

618
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:27,291
before you brought him here
to serve you.

619
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,417
He's one of the
thousands of species

620
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:31,166
that we've encountered.

621
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:34,542
We live in a peaceful
federation with most of them.

622
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:37,208
The people you see
are here by choice.

623
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,250
So, there are a privileged few
who serve on these ships

624
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,709
living in luxury
and wanting for nothing,

625
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,542
but what about
everybody else?

626
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:46,667
What about the poor?

627
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:48,250
You ignore them.

628
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:52,291
Poverty was eliminated
on Earth a long time ago

629
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:55,333
and a lot of other things
disappeared with it--

630
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,417
hopelessness,
despair, cruelty...

631
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,375
Young lady,
I come from a time

632
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:02,375
when men achieve
power and wealth

633
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:04,417
by standing on the backs
of the poor,

634
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:07,417
where prejudice
and intolerance are commonplace

635
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,458
and power is an end
unto itself,

636
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,625
and you're telling me
that isn't how it is anymore?

637
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:17,291
That's right.

638
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:18,667
Hmm.

639
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:21,917
Hmm...

640
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:24,709
Maybe...

641
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,542
it's worth giving up
cigars for after all.

642
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,083
(<i> door opens</i> )

643
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:39,542
Any luck?

644
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,959
Not so far.

645
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,333
His activating units
won't initialize.

646
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:46,375
I thought they would
have been protected

647
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:47,834
by his buffering program,

648
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:51,166
but... I guess 500 years
is just too long a wait.

649
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,125
What...?

650
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:54,083
My watch!

651
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:56,125
(<i> chuckles</i> )

652
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,083
Yeah.

653
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:02,417
It was found in the cavern
where Data's head was.

654
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,458
I guess after 500 years,

655
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,875
that's not likely
to work, either.

656
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:09,750
Mr. Data...

657
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:15,041
I fear I have sadly
misjudged you...

658
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,417
as I have misjudged
many things.

659
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,375
(<i> moaning</i> )

660
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,333
Can you communicate?

661
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:33,709
Mm.

662
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,208
Yes.

663
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,208
You're injured.

664
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,500
Why have you
interfered with us?

665
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:42,625
You hunt us.

666
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,125
You kill us.

667
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:46,834
We cannot allow that.

668
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:49,834
We need your energy.

669
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,166
Well, perhaps we can
find a substitute.

670
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:53,291
No.

671
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:56,208
There is none.

672
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,583
We must continue.

673
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:03,291
We know how you move
back and forth through time.

674
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,250
My crew have returned
to the 24th century

675
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:08,417
to destroy your transport site

00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,667
on Devidia II.

677
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:12,125
Destroy it?

678
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,125
Your weapons will only
amplify the time distortion.

679
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:23,333
You will annihilate
your own world.

680
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,667
I'm going back
for Captain Picard.

681
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:38,417
Mr. Worf, assemble an away team
to accompany me to the surface.

682
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,792
Doctor, I need to know

683
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:41,667
anything you can tell me
about that Ophidian.

684
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:43,041
I've just started
running some tests.

685
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,417
If I can have
a few hours...

686
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,083
I can't give the alien
any more time.

687
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,709
Will, I haven't
been able to determine

688
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,542
if our phaser energy
can generate a stable field.

689
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,208
The risk would be...
I'll take that risk!

690
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,917
Sir, permission
to speak frankly.

691
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:58,000
RIKER:
Go ahead.

692
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,834
Our priority is
to stop the aliens

693
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,834
from any more incursions
to Earth.

694
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,959
Any delay is
unacceptable.

695
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,333
If I can save Captain Picard,
I consider that very acceptable.

696
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,041
The captain would not.

697
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:13,667
I recommend we target
photon torpedoes

698
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:17,375
on the alien habitat
and destroy it... immediately.

699
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,000
He's right, Will.

700
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,125
Power up the photons, Mr. Worf.

701
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,291
Alert me when they're ready.

702
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:36,125
Computer... initialize
the reload circuits.

703
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,875

Reload circuits
are initializing.

704
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:40,250
Okay.

705
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:47,750
Data... this ought to do it.

706
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:53,583
Oh, I don't get it.

707
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:58,166
I don't understand why
this isn't working.

708
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:59,709
(<i> sighs</i> )

709

710
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:06,166
run me a diagnostic
on the input polarizers.

711
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:10,291
There is intermittent
contact in the input polarizers.

712
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,458
Intermittent?

713
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,000
What...?

714
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:38,375
An iron filing.

715
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:40,291
How'd that get in there?

716
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,875
(<i> sighs</i> )

717
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,750
Commander, I have
set the photons

718
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:38,208
to fire in
staggered rounds

719
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,458
detonating in
ten-second intervals.

720
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,291
Very well.
Fire when ready.

721
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:46,792
The sequence will be ready
to initiate in one minute.

722
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:50,959
Computer, run another diagnostic
on the input polarizers.

723
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,458
COMPUTER: Polarizer circuits
are functioning.

724
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,792
Well, then,
that ought to do it.

725
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:02,041
(<i> chuckles</i> )

726
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:05,542
Okay, Data, come on now.

727
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:11,959
Torpedoes...

728
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,333
phasing...

729
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,792
alien...

730
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,750
(<i> clicks</i> )

731
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,875
I am processing
a binary message

732
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:26,166
entered into my static
memory by Captain Picard.

733
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,166
Geordi, are we
planning to fire

734
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:29,917
on the alien habitat?

735
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,458
Yeah, but...

736
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,583
It is imperative
that we do not.

737
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,041
I will explain later.

738
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,875
La Forge to Riker.
Hold your fire!

739
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:44,208
The binary message
left by the Captain

740
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,709
is not entirely clear.

741
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,250
He seemed to be concerned

742
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:51,041
about the phase differential
of our photon torpedoes.

743
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:54,125
That firing them might produce
catastrophic effects.

744
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,333
Then how
can we destroy
their habitat?

745
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,041
If I am correct,

746
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,959
we must modify our weapons so
that the force of the explosion

747
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,583
is rephased into
the aliens' time continuum.

748
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:05,959
If we outfit the photons
with phase discriminators

749
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,291
we could get
the variance we need.

750
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:08,417
How long
will it take you?

751
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:10,458
At least a couple of hours.

752
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,667
Fine. I'll have time
to go get him.

753
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:14,333
Sir?

754
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,125
I'm going back
to the 19th century
to get the captain.

755
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:17,125
Doctor?

756
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,041
My analysis of the phasers

757
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:21,458
suggests you'd be able
to open the rift,

758
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,834
but it won't be stable enough

759
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:25,208
to transport
more than one person.

760
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,333
You mean, if I go back,
only one of us could return?

761
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:28,792
CRUSHER:
That's right.

762
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,417
Then I have
the perfect solution for you.

763
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:34,542
I'm the one who should return
to the 19th century

764
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:38,667
and remain there, so your
captain can return here.

765
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,083
There's a risk.

766
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:41,750
We're not sure how stable
the rift will be.

767
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:43,959
Ah, there's risk
in everything.

768
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,625
The point is,
it's the right choice.

769
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,709
I've got more books
to write

770
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,291
and your captain
has a job to do here.

771
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,667
Geordi, you'll brief him
on what he needs to know?

772
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:55,834
Aye, sir.

773
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,500
I'm glad I have a chance

774
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:00,542
to thank you.

775
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,125
For what, sir?

776
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,166
Why, for starting me out

777
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:09,291
on the greatest adventure
a man's ever had, whoo!

778
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,792
And for helping
a bitter old man

779
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,709
to open his eyes

780
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:18,959
and see that the future
turned out pretty well...

781
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,917
after all.

782
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,041
I'm thirsty.

783
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,083
I'm going
to get help.

784
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:34,041
We have to get you
out of here.

785
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,333
Oh, no, don't go.

786
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,834
They'll be back
for you soon.

787
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,583
No. You need help.

788
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:41,709
(<i> approaching footsteps</i> )

789
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,208
This thing put me down
in the middle of Market Street.

790
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,208
Took forever to get here.

791
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,875
Commander La Forge
has just completed

792
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:56,041
the reconfiguration
of the photon torpedoes.

793
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,291
If Clemens got back,

794
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,875
the captain should
have been here by now.

795
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,250
We have no way
of knowing

796
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:04,291
if Mr. Clemens
was successful.

797
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:09,500
Reestablish your
firing pattern, Mr. Worf.

798
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:11,458
We'll wait five more minutes.

799
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,709
Aye, sir.

800
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,083
There's no time
for chitchat, sir.

801
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:18,709
According to Mr. La Forge--

802
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,417
who did get your message,
by the way--

803
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:27,000
a frequency setting of, uh...
.047 on your phaser

804
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:30,125
will correctly activate
this... this creature.

805
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,500
Now you have
to get help.

806
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:32,917
Guinan needs
medical attention.

807
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:35,125
I promise you, she
will be attended to.

808
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,375
And there is a bill
to be settled

809
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:37,625
at Mrs. Carmichael's
boarding house.

810
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:38,583
I'll settle it.

811
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:42,041
Thank you.
I wish...

812
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,041
I wish time would
have allowed me

813
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:45,458
to know you better.

814
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,959
Well, you'll just have
to read my books.

815
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,083
What I am
is pretty much there.

816
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,208
I'll see you
in 500 years, Picard.

817
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:04,083
And I'll see<i> you</i>
in a few minutes.

818
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:11,792
Commander, I am picking up

819
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:15,083
massive triolic wave activity
on the surface.

820
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,291
Is it the captain?

821
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,875
There are no
human life signs.

822
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:20,750
No sign of temporal
distortion?

823
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:23,875
No, sir, but triolic
activity is increasing.

824
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,041
The aliens.

825
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:28,125
Mr. Worf,
are the photons ready?

826
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:30,500
Yes, sir.

827
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:32,083
Fire.

828
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:36,375
Torpedoes away, sir.

829
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:41,041
Sir, I am detecting a temporal
distortion on the surface...

830
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:42,959
and human life signs.

831
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,792

832
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,417
O'Brien, get him
out of there!

833
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:58,750
Transporter room,
have you got him?

834
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:00,041
PICARD:
He has indeed, Commander,

835
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,834
and believe me,
it's good to be back.

836
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,166
WORF:
We have destroyed
the target.

837
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,417
There is no further indication
of triolic activity.

838
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:12,208
Ensign, lay in a course
for the nearest starbase.

839
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,208
Warp six.
