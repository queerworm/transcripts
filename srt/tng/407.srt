<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 44246.3.</i>

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,250
<i>We're investigating</i>
<i>radiation anomalies</i>

3
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,458
<i>reported in the</i>
<i>Gamma Arigulon system</i>

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,208
<i>by the starship</i> Lasalle.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,917
<i>Preliminary readings</i>
<i>are inconclusive.</i>

6
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:16,667
Mr. Data?

7
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:18,083
DATA:
No changes, Commander.

8
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,792
I can detect
no abnormalities

9
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:21,500
in the star's
radiant energy.

10
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:24,041
Prepare two
class-1 probes.

11
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,542
Probes ready, Captain.

12
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,000
Initiate
launch sequence.

13
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,750
(<i> tactical console beeping</i> )

14
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:33,083
Captain, Klingon attack cruiser
decloaking,

15
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,583
bearing 010, mark 237.

16
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,208
PICARD:
Belay that order, Mr. Data.

17
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,041
Did Starfleet mention any
Klingon ships in this sector?

18
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,875
On screen.

19
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:46,917
WORF:
We are being hailed.

20
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:48,333
RIKER:
All stop, Mr. Crusher.

21
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,250
Aye, sir.
All stop.

22
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,667
Open a channel.

23
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,792
Hello, Captain Picard.

24
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:58,750
Ambassador K'Ehleyr.

25
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,834
This is an unexpected
pleasure.

26
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,959
It's good to see
you again, Captain.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,291
Lieutenant Worf.

28
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,417
PICARD:
How may we be of
assistance, Ambassador?

29
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,000
There is an urgent matter
we must discuss, Captain.

30
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,333
Permission to come aboard?

31
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,917
PICARD:
Granted.

32
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,709
Lieutenant,
please receive our guest.

33
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,125
Captain.

34
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:26,291
I must request permission
to send another officer.

35
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,000
May I know your reason?

36
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:33,875
My dishonor among Klingons may
offend Ambassador K'Ehleyr.

37
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,500
Lieutenant, you are
a member of this crew,

38
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:40,041
and you will not
go into hiding

39
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,709
whenever a Klingon
vessel uncloaks.

40
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,125
I withdraw
my request, sir.

41
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,333
I just received
coordinates, sir.

42
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:57,166
Ready to transport two
from the Klingon vessel.

43
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,291
Two?

44
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,291
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,500
Energize.

46
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:07,458
(<i> transporter activates</i> )

47
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:51,083
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

48
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:55,208
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

49
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,041
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

50
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,750
<i>to explore</i>
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

51
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:05,208
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

52
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,750
<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

53
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,750
(<i> children talking</i> )

54
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,709
I hope he'll be
all right.

55
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,583
Alexander hasn't
had much contact

56
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,667
with other children.

57
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:46,000
Not even a bite on the cheek
for old time's sake?

58
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,417
Perhaps you are not
aware of my dishonor.

59
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,792
I have accepted...
discommendation.

60
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:57,041
I've heard.
So, now what?

61
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,959
I have to perform some
ridiculous ritual

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,750
to talk to you?

63
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:06,125
You may not respect
our traditions...

64
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,291
but I do.

65
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,792
Sorry.

66
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:12,959
I just thought you
might wanna talk.

67
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,834
A few minutes ago,
you looked like someone

68
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,041
with a question to ask.

69
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,917
Must I ask the question?

70
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,625
Yes. You must.

71
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,917
What should
I tell Alexander?

72
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,291
That he has no father?

73
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,166
The Klingon Empire
is at a critical juncture.

74
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,250
We may be facing civil war.

75
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,667
War over what?

76
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,333
K'EHLEYR:
The usual excuses--

77
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:56,792
tradition, duty... honor.

78
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,417
DATA: The word
"excuses" implies

79
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,500
ulterior motives
for a conflict.

80
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:02,500
I won't bore you
with the intricacies

81
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,250
of Klingon politics.

82
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,667
Basically, two factions
are trying to seize power.

83
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,000
Do you believe
there is a threat

84
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,583
to the Federation
in this struggle?

85
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:14,041
Klingon wars seldom remain
confined to the empire.

86
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,959
Sooner or later, they'll drag in
the neighboring star systems,

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,959
then the Tholians, the Ferengi.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,083
The Federation won't be able
to stay out of it for long.

89
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,500
This has been coming
for some time.

90
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:25,959
Only K'mpec,
the head of the council,

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,959
has been able to maintain
the peace.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,375
Now, something
has changed that.

93
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,166
Correct.

94
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,500
K'mpec is dying.

95
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:36,500
He is aboard
the cruiser.

96
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:41,959
He has come specifically to
meet with you, Captain... alone.

97
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,625
K'MPEC: It's about time
you arrived, Picard.

98
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,542
Sit.

99
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,291
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

100
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,792
(<i> grunts</i> )

101
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,375
I need your help.

102
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,625
If the<i> Enterprise</i>
medical facility

103
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,917
can do anything to help--

104
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,959
Too late.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
For some months,
I have been poisoned

106
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,542
with small doses
of Veridium Six.

107
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,125
The wine.

108
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,208
There is no cure.

109
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,208
(<i> chuckles</i> )

110
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,625
What do you want of me?

111
00:07:56,667 --> 00:08:00,917
After I die, you will
act in my name

112
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,625
to arbitrate the
struggle for power.

113
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,375
<i>I</i> will?

114
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:09,291
No one on the council
can be trusted

115
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:13,792
and... I have my reasons

116
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:17,166
for wanting
an outsider.

117
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:21,417
K'mpec, you cannot
possibly be serious.

118
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,125
A Federation officer
has no business--

119
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,458
Nonsense.

120
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,917
You are an
accomplished mediator.

121
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,083
This is no different
than any other dispute

122
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,333
requiring your
services.

123
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,166
On the contrary, I think
this is very different.

124
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,542
And I must
respectfully decline.

125
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:49,041
If you refuse the
dying request

126
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,542
of the Klingon
Supreme Commander,

127
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,375
it will be an insult

128
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:57,375
by the Federation
to all Klingons.

129
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:01,834
Besides, I've already
sent the order.

130
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,834
The leaders of
the opposing

131
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,709
two factions
are on their way.

132
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,917
You had no right to involve
me without my permission.

133
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,500
If I'd asked,
you would have said no.

134
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:24,291
This is not just a case
of simple mediation.

135
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:28,208
You are asking me
to choose the next leader

136
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,291
of the Klingon Empire.

137
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,542
No.

138
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:38,041
By tradition,
the two strongest challengers

139
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,709
fight for the right
of succession.

140
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,417
As mediator, only you

141
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,333
can designate
those challengers.

142
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:52,250
But you have just said there are
only two challengers arriving.

143
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,291
What is the point?

144
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,458
I want you
to discover

145
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,625
which one of them
has killed me--

146
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,458
Gowron or Duras.

147
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,333
Yes, Duras.

148
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:14,250
I thought you would
find that interesting.

149
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:18,041
Interesting.

150
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:28,166
You could say that,
since he tried to have me killed

151
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,250
and conspired to strip Worf
of his good name.

152
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:36,583
And... I approved.

153
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,125
All for the glory
of the empire.

154
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,417
(<i> chuckles</i> )

155
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,542
That should be
my epitaph.

156
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,375
Find the assassin.

157
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:59,875
A Klingon who kills without
showing his face has no honor.

158
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,834
He must not lead the empire.

159
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:07,834
Such a man would be
capable of anything.

160
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:13,208
Even war with
the Federation.

161
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,917
Very well.

162
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,458
I accept.

163
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,709
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

164
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,000
<i>K'mpec, who ruled</i>
<i>the Klingon Empire</i>

(<i> growling</i> )

170
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,250
GIRL: What did you
do that for?

171
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,041
GIRL 2: I know, now,
we have to start all over.

172
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,667
BOY:
Aw, man.

173
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:04,291
There is no honor in
attacking the weak.

174
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,583
I would have won.

175
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,917
No, you must
earn victory.

176
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,083
Where are the
other Klingons?

177
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,083
There are no others
on board.

178
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,458
Why?

179
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,041
The Federation and
the Klingon Empire

180
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,709
were enemies
for many years.

181
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,250
No other Klingons
have asked

182
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,834
to serve in Starfleet.

183
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,125
Why?

184
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,000
A warrior does not ask
so many questions.

185
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,750
I don't want to
be a warrior.

186
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,250
Hello!
(<i> grunts</i> )

187
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,250
Well, you're back early.

188
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,542
<i>He</i> made me leave.

189
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:51,375
Maybe you should go
to your room and play.

190
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,125
Is he under arrest?

191
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,000
He knows nothing
of our ways.

192
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,792
<i>Our</i> ways?

193
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,583
You mean Klingon ways,
don't you?

194
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,917
He is Klingon!

195
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,166
He is also my son,
and I am half human.

196
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,750
He will find
his own ways.

197
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,500
Why the sudden concern?

198
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,250
You won't even acknowledge
that he's yours.

199
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,709
Why did you
not tell me?

200
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,959
And what would
you have done?

201
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,667
That's right.

202
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:25,041
You would have insisted
that we take the oath,

203
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,959
just as tradition
would demand.

204
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,083
You should not have
kept<i> this</i> from me.

205
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:37,542
Well... now, you know.

206
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:46,542
I cannot acknowledge my
relationship to the boy.

207
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,667
(<i> scoffs</i> )

208
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,083
It would only harm him.

209
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,917
Because you were
dishonored?

210
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,208
As my son,
he would also bear my disgrace.

211
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,458
As would
his children.

212
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,125
But why did you accept
discommendation

213
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,291
from the High Council?

214
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,000
My father was accused

215
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,250
of collaborating
with the Romulans at Khitomer.

216
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,959
I know, and I also know
that you challenged it.

217
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,875
Yes, at first.

218
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,500
Ultimately, I withdrew
my challenge.

219
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:13,709
But why, Worf?

220
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,709
I can't believe
you'd just give up.

221
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,583
What<i> really</i> happened?

222
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,583
RIKER: Lieutenant Worf,
Ambassador K'Ehleyr,

223
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,208
report to the bridge.

224
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,417
On our way,
Commander.

225
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,834
Klingon vessels
<i>Vorn</i> and<i> Buruk</i>

226
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,375
holding stations at
13 kilometers, sir.

227
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:43,291
Open a channel,
Mr. Data.

228
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,500
Channel is open, sir.

229
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:47,208
<i>Vorn</i> responding
to hail.

230
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,583
On screen.

231
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,166
Let's get this
over with, Picard.

232
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,458
In good time, Duras.

233
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,834
Even in death,
K'mpec makes foolish decisions.

234
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,083
You should not be
involved in this, human.

235
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,959
The<i> Sonchi</i> ceremony
will take place

236
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,917
in one hour
aboard K'mpec's vessel.

237
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,291
One hour!
What is the delay?

238
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,959
There is no delay.

239
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,458
It is the time
I have chosen.

240
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:17,000
Exactly one hour, Picard.

241
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,834
Do not be late.

242
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,125
Keep that<i> petaQ</i>
away from the ceremony, Picard!

243
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,583
He has no place
on a Klingon ship.

244
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,959
Picard out.

245
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,709
(<i> sighs</i> )
Contact Gowron's ship.

246
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,208
Tell him to meet us
aboard K'mpec's vessel.

247
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,291
Ambassador, meet me

248
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,542
in Transporter Room Six
in one hour.

249
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,792
We will begin the ceremony
a little late.

250
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,166
Mr. Worf.

251
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,166
Mr. Worf,
the next few days

252
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,291
will be difficult
for you.

253
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,166
You have made it clear
that I am to perform

254
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,208
my regular duties, sir.

255
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,375
I want you to know
that I am aware

256
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,375
of your discomfort.

257
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,166
Thank you, sir.

258
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,667
Ambassador K'Ehleyr
will be preparing me

259
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:10,166
for my role in the
Rite of Succession.

260
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,166
Permission to
speak freely, sir.

261
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,333
Granted.

262
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:19,041
Duras must not be allowed
to lead the council.

263
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,583
He has a legal claim, Mr. Worf.

264
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,542
Your personal feelings
towards him--

265
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,333
It is not personal, sir.

266
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,000
His father betrayed my people
to the Romulans.

267
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,625
Duras is a traitor.

268
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,083
Klingon tradition
may hold the son

269
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,083
responsible
for his father's sin.

270
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,500
I cannot.

271
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,041
Treason was his
father's crime.

272
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,291
Duras' crime

273
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:46,083
was to lay that blame
on<i> your</i> father.

274
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,834
I will not forget that.

275
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,375
But you should not forget
that you chose to accept

276
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:53,709
the consequences
of that lie.

277
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,166
To preserve the empire.

278
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:05,041
The issue now is whether
or not he killed K'mpec.

279
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,000
Sir?

280
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,000
He was murdered.

281
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,667
Poisoned.

282
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,875
A Klingon
would not use poison.

283
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,000
His murder would
have no honor.

284
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:32,208
K'mpec believed that it was
either Duras or Gowron.

285
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:38,250
Well, I know little of Gowron,
only that he is an outsider

286
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,208
who has often
challenged the council.

287
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,291
But Duras... I know him.

288
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:52,917
His heart is not Klingon.

289
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,125
That's Gowron.

290
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,375
I hope this will be brief.

291
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:15,208
It will be just
long enough to prove

292
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,709
that K'mpec is dead.

293
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:35,875
<i>Qab jIH nagil.</i>

294
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,709
<i>Qab jIH nagil.</i>

295
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,583
<i>Qab jIH... nagil.</i>

296
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,250
<i>Sonchi.</i>

297
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,083
Now, complete the
Rite of Succession.

298
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,000
It's obvious who the
two challengers are.

299
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,375
We will proceed according to the
traditions and the precedents

300
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,333
set down in
Klingon law.

301
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:38,375
What do you know
of Klingon law...

302
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:39,792
human?

303
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,792
We will reconvene on
board the<i> Enterprise--</i>

304
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:45,125
No! Finish it here!
Now!

305
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,750
(<i> explosion</i> )

306
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,917
(<i> door opens</i> )

307
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:07,375
I have not received your report
on the explosion.

308
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:11,917
Two Klingons killed,
a few minor injuries.

309
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,500
Were you concerned
about me?

310
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:18,667
As head of security, it is
my duty to be concerned.

311
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:22,750
Is that it-- just official
concern for my well-being?

312
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,875
You know my feelings.

313
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,834
Maybe I've forgotten.

314
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,792
You were right.

315
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,959
I would have insisted
we take the oath.

316
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,959
But not just because
of tradition.

317
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,875
I thought about
telling you.

318
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:47,834
Wanted to tell you.

319
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,375
But I wasn't ready.

320
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,083
When I left,
you said

321
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,875
that you'd never be
complete without me.

322
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,917
It took some time, but...

323
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:04,333
I came to realize that...
I need you, too.

324
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,333
You're a part of me, Worf.

325
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,667
<i>jIH dok.</i>

326
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,917
<i>Maj dok.</i>

327
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,333
No.

328
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,834
I can't allow you to
suffer my humiliation.

329
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,375
There would be
no suffering.

330
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:48,625
I don't care what other
Klingons think of you.

331
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,583
But what of the boy?

332
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:54,583
He may want to live
in the empire someday.

333
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,500
He would be an outcast--

334
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:58,625
another traitor from
a family of traitors.

335
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,917
"Family of traitors."

336
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:02,750
I don't believe
that for a minute.

337
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:10,542
Respect my wishes
in this matter.

338
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:14,208
I cannot take
the oath with you.

339
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:19,542
Nor can I claim
your son.

340
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:29,000
If you cannot be
his father...

341
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,291
at least be his friend.

342
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,667
We haven't completed our
analysis of the bomb debris.

343
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,250
Dr. Crusher is still
studying the remains

344
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,792
of the men killed
in the explosion.

345
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,291
We need more time.

346
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,333
Duras and Gowron will be
here in a few minutes.

347
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,583
I don't think you can
delay this meeting again.

348
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,542
Is there any way
of stretching out

349
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,709
the formalities
once they arrive?

350
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,667
In the modern
Rite of Succession,

351
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,792
only a brief proclamation
that two challengers

352
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:02,166
have been chosen
is necessary.

353
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,667
You said "modern rite."

354
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:05,709
How was the ritual
performed in the past?

355
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,458
The old forms dictated

356
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,834
that the challengers
perform the<i> ja'chuq.</i>

357
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,792
It's a long,
involved ceremony

358
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:14,417
in which the challengers
list the battles they've won,

359
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,625
the prizes they've taken--
the idea being to prove

360
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,750
their worthiness
to lead the council.

361
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,667
Can the old form
still be used?

362
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,041
It's up to you.

363
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,917
You can use
whatever form you want.

364
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,291
Thank you.

365
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:37,750
Captain, what do you know
about Worf's discommendation?

366
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:38,959
My interest is personal.

367
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,375
I understand
that you were there,

368
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,959
that you stood by him
before the council.

369
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,625
I'd like to know
what happened.

370
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:48,333
I'm sorry, I can't discuss it.

371
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,917
Council must have
a leader now!

372
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:07,542
Complete the rite,
so I can kill this<i> Ha'DIbaH.</i>

373
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:12,250
You will die slowly, Duras.

374
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:16,291
You have already proved you
haven't the courage to face me.

375
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,333
Perhaps you should plant
another bomb.

376
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,125
(<i> screams</i> )

377
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,333
<i>Mev yap!</i>

378
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,208
Sit down.

379
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,667
We will begin the<i> ja'chuq.</i>

380
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,208
What?

381
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,041
This woman has been giving you
bad advice, Picard.

382
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,917
The<i> ja'chuq</i> is obsolete.

383
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:52,625
It is my choice to respect
the ancient rituals.

384
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:54,875
Each of you will have
to prove your worthiness

385
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,166
to lead the High Council.

386
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,291
That will take hours.

387
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:02,375
Or days, depending
on your cooperation.

388
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:16,083
What is this?

389
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,750
WORF:
A<i> bat'leth.</i>

390
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:20,291
It belonged
to my father.

391
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:23,500
It has been in our family
for ten generations.

392
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:25,834
Let me hold it.

393
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:39,875
No.
No, no, no.

394
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:43,250
Do not think of
it as a weapon.

395
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:47,875
Make it part of
your hand,

396
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,500
part of your arm.

397
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,208
Make it part
of you.

398
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,500
The next meeting
is in three hours.

399
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:07,291
I would speak with
you alone, Ambassador.

400
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,458
I'm honored.

401
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,417
Picard is prolonging
the<i> ja'chuq.</i> Why?

402
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:16,625
He has sufficient reason
to proceed carefully.

403
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:17,834
He relies on you

404
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,625
for his knowledge
of Klingon law?

405
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,667
Yes.

406
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:26,250
Then he values
your advice.

407
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,959
You could
quicken the pace.

408
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,041
Possibly.
Why should I?

409
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:34,834
Your position is... unique.

410
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:38,417
Have you never wondered about
serving the Klingon Empire?

411
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:41,083
I serve in my own way.

412
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,542
As a Federation ambassador.

413
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,208
A few rewards...

414
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,583
but little glory.

415
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,458
What do you want?

416
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:56,291
What do<i> you</i> want?
Command of a ship?

417
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,333
A seat on the council?

418
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:02,625
There are many opportunities
for you in the empire.

419
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:05,417
Opportunities that
will present themselves

420
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,375
only if<i> you</i> come to power.

421
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,917
You talk like a Ferengi.

422
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:16,250
K'mpec was also stubborn.
He, too, refused to listen.

423
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,542
<i>Now...</i>

424
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,333
he is gone.

425
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,333
You need not make
the same mistake.

426
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:29,834
K'mpec was old and weak.

427
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,125
<i>I</i> am not.

428
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:34,750
(<i> chuckling</i> )

429
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:45,583
We've completed our analysis
of the bomb debris, Commander.

430
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:48,125
The explosive was a
triceron derivative.

431
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,000
And the entire device
couldn't have been

432
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,333
more than three cubic
millimeters in size.

433
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:55,458
It could have been hidden
anywhere in that room.

434
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,875
There's one more thing.

435
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:59,542
The bomb had a
molecular-decay detonator.

436
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:02,083
Only one race uses
that device, sir.

437
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,834
The Romulans.

438
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,375
How could the Romulans
plant a bomb

439
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:14,458
on board a Klingon
attack cruiser?

440
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,083
It would be
impossible.

441
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:19,583
Not if the Romulans had help
from one of the Klingons.

442
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,375
Klingons and Romulans
working together?

443
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:24,166
They've been blood
enemies for 75 years.

444
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:27,500
Perhaps Duras or Gowron wishes
to improve that relationship.

445
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:30,166
A new Klingon alliance
with the Romulans?

446
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,291
If true,
it would represent

447
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,959
a fundamental shift of
power in the quadrant.

448
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,917
Indeed. It would
put the Federation

449
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:39,750
in a very difficult position.

450
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:42,041
Duras or Gowron?

451
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:44,083
Gowron came to me alone.

452
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,917
Wanted me to
speed up the<i> ja'chuq.</i>

453
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,625
Offered me a seat
on the council

454
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:48,959
if I'd help him.

455
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,917
That doesn't suggest a
Romulan connection.

456
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:53,583
He also implied
I'd end up like K'mpec

457
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,458
if I didn't cooperate.

458
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,250
WORF:
Captain, I disagree.

459
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:59,750
It must be Duras.

460
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:01,917
Why?

461
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:03,709
PICARD: We have had
prior dealings

462
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,208
with Duras that show him
to be untrustworthy.

463
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,041
Can you be more specific?

464
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,709
No.

465
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,500
Mr. Worf,

466
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,542
we have a conspiracy
on our hands

467
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,333
that could be a direct threat

468
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,917
to the security
of the Federation.

469
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,500
Yes, sir.

470
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:21,750
As chief security officer,
I want you to accompany me

471
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,083
to the next proceeding.

472
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:28,333
Captain, they will be incensed.

473
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:31,166
My presence
will be disruptive.

474
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:34,500
Yes. It will.

475
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:42,625
Computer, list stardates
of the last<i> Enterprise</i> mission

476
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:44,375
to the Klingon home planet.

477
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:49,083
COMPUTER:
Stardates 43685 through 43689.

478
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:51,291
How many ship's logs
during that period?

479
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:55,917
COMPUTER: 43 officer's logs,
ten personal logs.

480
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:58,375
Is there a personal log
for Lieutenant Worf?

481
00:29:58,417 --> 00:29:59,667
COMPUTER:
Affirmative.

482
00:29:59,709 --> 00:30:01,583
Access is restricted.

483
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,834
Eliminate all personal logs.

484
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:07,917
List the remaining 43
in chronological order.

485
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:11,166
We'll just take them
one at a time.

486
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:19,458
<i>jIH Doq...</i>

487
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,041
<i>batlh!</i>

488
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,667
Both your claims have been
properly made and recorded.

489
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:38,250
We are ready for the
final phase of the<i> ja'chuq.</i>

490
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,834
There will
be a recess

491
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:42,125
while I review your petitions.

492
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,291
I'm sure you're
as concerned as I am

493
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,458
about the explosion aboard
K'mpec's vessel.

494
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,500
I assume that you are both
continuing your investigations.

495
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:56,917
The investigations are complete.

496
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:59,834
They revealed nothing
of any importance.

497
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,667
Now, that's very surprising.

498
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:07,458
Our analysis
turned up some...

499
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,083
startling results.

500
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,667
Will you join us, Lieutenant?

501
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,125
What is this?!

502
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,834
He has no place here,
Picard!

503
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,750
I will not sit at
the same table with that.

504
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:24,750
It is my prerogative
to investigate anything

505
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:27,458
that may be relevant to
the Rite of Succession.

506
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Lieutenant Worf is my
chief security officer.

507
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:31,083
His presence
is required.

508
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,709
We will not proceed.

509
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,417
If you wish to withdraw
from the<i> ja'chuq...</i>

510
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,291
that is your option.

511
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,792
Proceed, Mr. Worf.

512
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:50,458
What did your investigations
reveal about the explosion?

513
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,792
It was a bomb.

514
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,125
And was your analysis

515
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,083
just as...
insightful?

516
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,750
It was a common explosive.

517
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:04,500
WORF:
What type?

518
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:05,834
Triceron.

519
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,000
What about
the detonator?

520
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,333
DURAS:
This is pointless!

521
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:10,166
The findings were inconclusive.

522
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:16,959
Fortunately, our investigation
was more thorough.

523
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,583
The bomb used
a molecular-decay detonator.

524
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,208
What?

525
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,250
A Romulan device.

526
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:28,583
I will return to my
ship to confirm

527
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:32,625
these...
conclusions myself.

528
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:35,792
As will I.

529
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:38,583
Mr. Worf, please be sure
to send a complete record

530
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:43,959
of our findings to both vessels,
and to the High Council.

531
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,291
Aye, sir.

532
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,875
PICARD:
That will be all.

533
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:49,500
Computer, interlock

534
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:52,083
with the Klingon Imperial
information net.

535
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,875
COMPUTER:
Interlock established.

536
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:57,166
Federation Ambassador K'Ehleyr
requesting diplomatic access

537
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,375
to High Council record,

538
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:01,834
COMPUTER:
Proceed.

539
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,667
Computer, display summary

540
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:05,792
of the most recent
High Council inquiry

541
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,417
regarding Khitomer Massacre.

542
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,083
COMPUTER:
Access denied.

543
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:12,875
Restricted materials,
<i>du-ko-cha</i> clearance only.

544
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:14,625
By whose order?

545
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:17,500
COMPUTER:
Council member Duras.

546
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:19,667
Access biographical files.

547
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:22,792
Subject name,
Counselor Duras.

548
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:32,917
Advise my counselors
on the<i> Vorn</i> to convene.

549
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,583
There is much to discuss.

550
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,917
Look.

551
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,333
What is this?

552
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,750
Priority message to you
from the home planet.

553
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:41,458
It seems
Ambassador K'Ehleyr

554
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,208
is looking into things
she should not be.

555
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,542
Distract the guard for me.

556
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:50,166
Yes, sir.

557
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:54,000
GUARD:
Sir... excuse me, sir.

558
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:56,709
You cannot leave your
quarters without an escort.

559
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,750
(<i> door chimes</i> )

560
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:00,333
Come.

561
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,041
I have been informed
of your attempt

562
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,333
to access restricted
council records.

563
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,750
I have been investigating
what happened at Khitomer.

564
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:10,834
Not at all an easy task,

565
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:13,542
considering that most
of the records are sealed.

566
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,333
Worf's father was a traitor.

567
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:19,333
No, the evidence was altered
to make it appear that way.

568
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:22,333
I found it interesting
to read that your father

569
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:24,834
was also at Khitomer,
and you

570
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,750
are the one who
sealed the records.

571
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:28,792
You dare insult
my father's name?

572
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,667
Don't play the wounded
Klingon for me, Duras.

573
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:33,375
You don't do it very well.

574
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:37,166
What happened in
that council chamber?

575
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,583
How did you get Worf to
take the blame for you?

576
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,667
Do not pursue
this matter further.

577
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:46,000
The son betrays his
people to the Romulans,

578
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:48,500
just as his father did...

579
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:50,792
Duras.

580
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:58,792
One of the Klingons who
died in the explosion

581
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:01,375
was with Duras,
the other was with Gowron.

582
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:02,875
I've been examining
the bodies,

583
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:06,041
trying to get a clue as to
where the bomb was hidden.

584
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:07,750
There's always a pattern

585
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:09,750
in the lacerations
and tissue damage.

586
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:12,375
It would normally give a clear
indication as to the direction,

587
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:13,792
distance, force of impact.

588
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:16,166
"Normally?"

589
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:17,917
In this case,
the pattern

590
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:20,333
was virtually
impossible to detect.

591
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:22,667
I couldn't understand it until
I looked at the dynoscans.

592
00:35:22,709 --> 00:35:26,083
This wound is different
from all of the others.

593
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,375
It was made

594
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,208
from the inside out.

595
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:33,458
The bomb was implanted
in one of their forearms.

596
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,750
It's considered a honorable way
for a Klingon to die.

597
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:40,291
A suicide that takes
an enemy with it.

598
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:42,375
Which one of them was it?

599
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:44,583
Duras' man.

600
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:47,959
When we have more time,

601
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:49,291
I will take you
to the holodeck

602
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:51,709
and demonstrate
in more detail.

603
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:57,667
Medical emergency!
Deck eight, room 142.

604
00:35:57,709 --> 00:35:59,166
(<i> K'Ehleyr groans</i> )

605
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:09,125
Gowron?

606
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,333
No.

607
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:16,000
Duras.

608
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:18,792
Alexander...

609
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,166
(<i> groans</i> )

610
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,166
(<i> gasps</i> )

611
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,959
K'Ehleyr.

612
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,125
K'Ehleyr!

613
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:48,208
(<i> roaring</i> )

614
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:21,333
You have never
seen death.

615
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,333
Then look.

616
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:31,667
And always remember.

617
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:43,000
Stay with the doctor.

618
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,333
Worf, when did you...?

619
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:49,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

620
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,959
Multiple stab wounds
to the chest and abdomen.

621
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,500
Too much trauma to the
internal organs.

622
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:21,125
There wasn't time enough
to take her into stasis.

623
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,583
Where's Worf?

624
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:23,792
I don't know.

625
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,792
He disappeared just
after I arrived.

626
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:28,083
Riker to Lieutenant Worf.

627
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,333
Computer, locate
Lieutenant Worf.

628
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:35,917
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Worf
is not aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

629
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,542
Where is he?

630
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,041
COMPUTER:
Lieutenant Worf transported

631
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:43,125
to the Klingon ship<i> Vorn</i>
at 1730 hours.

632
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,750
On my way.

633
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:55,041
Duras.

634
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,709
(<i> Klingons muttering</i> )

635
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:02,458
What is<i> that</i> doing here?

636
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,083
He has claimed the
Right of Vengeance.

637
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:09,542
You have no rights
here, traitor!

638
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:24,250
K'ehleyr... was my mate.

639
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:27,083
(<i> murmurs of surprise</i> )

640
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,458
(<i> grunts</i> )

641
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:39,125
If Lieutenant Worf
resists, sir?

642
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:41,125
He's coming back with us,
one way or another.

643
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:43,375
Set phasers
on maximum stun.

644
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:02,041
I'm the only one, Worf.

645
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,375
The only one who can
prove your innocence.

646
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:06,291
Kill me, and you're
a traitor forever.

647
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:08,625
Then that is how
it shall be.

648
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,125
RIKER:
Worf!

649
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:49,500
Mr. Worf, your service
aboard the<i> Enterprise</i>

650
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:51,542
has been exemplary...

651
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,125
until now.

652
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:58,834
Sir, I have acted
within the boundaries

653
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,458
of Klingon law and tradition.

654
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,208
The High Council
would seem to agree.

655
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,208
They consider the matter closed.

656
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,500
I don't.

657
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,667
Mr. Worf, the
<i>Enterprise</i> crew

658
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:15,667
currently includes
representatives from 13 planets.

659
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:18,125
They each have their individual
beliefs and values,

660
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:21,291
and I respect them all.

661
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:26,125
But they have all chosen
to serve Starfleet.

662
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:30,583
If anyone cannot perform
his or her duty

663
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:33,500
because of the demands
of their society,

664
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,250
they should resign.

665
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:46,250
Do you wish to resign?

666
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,375
No, sir.

667
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,333
I had hoped you
would not throw away

668
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:00,291
a promising career.

669
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:06,083
I understand your loss.

670
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:09,667
We all admired K'Ehleyr.

671
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:16,458
A reprimand will
appear on your record.

672
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,041
Dismissed.

673
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:20,583
Mr. Worf?

674
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:27,000
Isn't it time for the truth

675
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,500
about your father's innocence
to be told?

676
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:31,959
After all, you only
accepted this dishonor

677
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,750
to protect the name of Duras
and hold the empire together.

678
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:38,625
Now that he has
died in disgrace,

679
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:42,125
what is gained by
further silence?

680
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:44,500
Each member
of the Klingon High Council

681
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:46,250
has shared in that lie.

682
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:50,500
They will not be so willing
to admit their own dishonor.

683
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:53,834
But... the day will come

684
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:57,000
when my brother and I will...

685
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:00,000
convince them
to speak the truth.

686
00:43:18,959 --> 00:43:21,875
My parents...

687
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:26,125
my human parents will
meet us at Starbase 73.

688
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:29,125
They will care for you.

689
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,667
Why can't I stay with you?

690
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,792
You deserve a home.

691
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:39,291
A family.

692
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:41,333
They can provide that.

693
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:44,417
I cannot.

694
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,834
I miss her, too.

695
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,792
Are you my father?

696
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,917
Yes.

697
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:12,000
I am your father.
