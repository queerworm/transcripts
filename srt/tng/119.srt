Jake!

3
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:16,667
Jake, wait a second.

4
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:17,917
How you doing?

5
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,583
I'm fine.

6
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,000
Really.

7
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:25,875
Jake, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:27,291
DR. CRUSHER:
Acting Ensign Crusher,

9
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:30,458
report to Transporter
Room eight.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,792
It's not your fault.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,417
Yeah, I know.

12
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,291
I wish both of us
were going.

13
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,792
Ah... only 32 points...

14
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:41,709
Mr. Crusher, respond.

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,166
I'm on my way, Doctor.

16
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,375
I've got to go.

17
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:49,834
I know.

18
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,959
Hey, Wes...

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,750
do well for both
of us, okay?

20
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,583
All right.

Sir.

34
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:43,333
Allow me
to introduce my staff.

35
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,792

Chief of Security,
Natasha Yar.

38
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:51,542
Well, what can
we do for you?

39
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,083
I need to speak with you.

40
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,125
Certainly. This way.
Number One?

41
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,250
Alone.

42
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,208
Is this a personal matter?

43
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,542
Official business.

44
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,750
Well, then,
my first officer should...

45
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,333
Alone, Captain.

46
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,375
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

47
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,417
<i>These are the voyages</i>

<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

49
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,667
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

<i>to explore</i>

<i>to boldly go</i>
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

53
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,917
Commander Remmick is with
the Inspector General's office.

54
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:18,834
Oh.

55
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,792
He'll be conducting
a full investigation

56
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,000
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

57
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,458
What are you looking for?

58
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,041
I have reason
to believe

59
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,000
that there may be something
very wrong on this ship.

60
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,792
Tell me what you suspect.

61
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:33,375
It's inappropriate to discuss it
at this time.

62
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:36,458
Mr. Remmick, Starfleet
is counting on you.

63
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,291
You will find out what is wrong
on this ship.

64
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,709
Yes, sir.

65
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,750
Nothing and no one
will stand in my way.

66
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,166
And you,
Captain...

67
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,667
are ordered to cooperate
in every way necessary

68
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,542
with this investigation.
Is that clear?

69
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,291
Yes, sir.

70
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,000
Mr. Remmick, unless there are
any further questions...

71
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,041
No questions, sir.

72
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,250
Get on with
your duties.

73
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,500
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,166
We've known one another
for years.

75
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,458
Tell me what
you believe is wrong.

76
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,417
Captain, it is vitally important

77
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,000
that my orders
be followed exactly.

78
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,166
I'll be staying on the ship.

79
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,625
As you wish, Admiral.

(<i> rapid beeping</i> )

81
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,625
What is it?

82
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,041
What?

83
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,667
The unit you
just put down.

84
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,500
Don't worry,
I won't tell anyone.

85
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:41,500
It's a flux coordinating
sensor unit.

86
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:45,166
I'm Oliana Mirren, one
of the other finalists.

87
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,417
You must be
Wesley Crusher.

88
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,041
Yeah.

89
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,667
Do you know me?

90
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:53,750
I heard there was a very smart,
very young man

91
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:56,333
who would be
tough competition.

92
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,000
Well,<i> you</i> wouldn't be here...

93
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,083
If I weren't smart.

94
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,166
I know.

95
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,875
But there's a lot more to it
than just that.

96
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,583
You're lucky.

97
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,125
You've had practical experience
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

98
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,417
Oliana.

99
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,917
T'Shanik of Vulcana Regar.

Wesley Crusher
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

101
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,291
You do not look as if you
meet the age requirements.

102
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,583
I'll be 16 next month.

103
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,250
Oh, happy birthday.

104
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,125
Excuse me.

the Mordock Strategy?

00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,000
I thought you were
already in the Academy.

110
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,083
No.

111
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,125
Only a hopeful, like you.

I am Tac Officer Chang.

116
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,959
Welcome.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,750
You are here
because you are all

118
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,417
top candidates.

119
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,792
Although only
one student

120
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:14,667
will be chosen
for the Academy,

121
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,709
you have shown from
the preliminary testing

122
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,875
that any of you
could easily qualify.

123
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:25,125
Now, this may be
the most difficult,

124
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,792
exhausting experience
of your life--

125
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:31,125
and the most exciting
challenge.

126
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,041
Expect...

127
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,750
the unexpected.

128
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,792
May you all do your best.

May I help you, Mr. Remmick?

00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,291
Keep doing whatever it is
you're doing, Commander Data.

133
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:12,083
There's, uh, nothing much
to see here, Commander.

134
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,667
We're in a standard orbit,
and, uh...

135
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,125
the station has to be manned
even if it's just routine.

136
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,583
Something I can
help you with,
Mr. Remmick?

137
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,208
When I'm ready,
Mr. Riker,

138
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,875
I'll want to speak
with you... privately.

139
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,959
Commander.

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,041
Just having that guy around
makes me feel guilty.

141
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,667
What's he after, anyway?

142
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:37,709
I don't know, Geordi,
but I'm going to find out

143
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,041
right now.

144

(<i> doorbell chimes</i> )

145
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,041
Come.

146
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,709
Captain,
may I speak frankly?

147
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,250
Always, Number One.

148
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,667
As First Officer,
I should be informed.

149
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,291
I should know everything
that you know.

150
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,959
That's right,
you should.

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,750
Then what's this about?

152
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,583
Remmick's going to turn
this ship upside down.

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,500
That's his job.

154
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,208
And my job is to see that
this ship runs smoothly.

155
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,500
Which you do very well.

156
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:10,333
Sir, am I under
investigation?

157
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,750
I don't know.

158
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,083
And if you did?

159
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,458
I couldn't tell you.

160
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,917
I don't understand, sir.

161
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,041
This is extremely frustrating.

162
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,458
No less for me.
But I promised cooperation,

163
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,750
and that's
what we shall give.

164
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,291
Sir.

165
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,333
I want some answers from
you now, Commander Riker...
Later.

166
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,458
You were ordered
to cooperate.
Not now!

167
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,625
When it doesn't interfere
with my duties, Remmick.

168

COMPUTER:
Last question
on the hyperspace physics test.

169
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:58,583
If the matter and antimatter
tanks on a galaxy class starship

170
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:02,542
are nine-tenths depleted,
calculate the intermix ratio

171
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,834
necessary to reach
a starbase

172
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:09,500

warp factor 8.

173
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,625

You now have one hour free
before the next test.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,125
I must admit, Wesley,
you have a very fast mind.

180
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,083
Once I realized it
was a trick question,

181
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,667
there was only
one answer.

182
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:49,083
Yes. There is only one ratio
with matter-antimatter.

183
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,583
One to one.

184
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,250
You both don't know
how lucky you are.

185
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,250
I can't imagine
what it would be like

186
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,291
to have things
come so easily.

187
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,041
I have to push
every step of the way.

188
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,083
Oh, no, Oliana,

189
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,250
it doesn't come
that easily.

190
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,125
I have to study
all the time.

191
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,709
It's a good thing
you're cute, Wesley,

192
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,917
or you could
really be obnoxious.

193
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,834
See you later.

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,041
Did you hear what
she said, Mordock?

195
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,667
She said
I was cute.

196
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:23,709
Is that good,
Wesley?

197
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,375
Yes.

198
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,709
I think.

199
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,542
I think I should
apologize, Captain.

200
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,750
No need,
Number One.

201
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,375
Mr. Remmick's presence
is unnerving

202
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,709
to say the least.

203
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,500
Are you available now,
Mr. Riker,

204
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:45,125
or do you still have
duties to perform?

205
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,625
I'm available, Mr. Remmick.

206
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,208
Any problem with using
your ready room, Captain?

207
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,750
No, Mr. Remmick.

208
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,875
Be my guest.

209
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,625
If you prefer to stand,
fine, Mr. Riker.

210
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:26,417
It won't have an effect
on the length of my inquiry.

211
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,959
Now...

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,834
there are several
seeming discrepancies

213
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,166
in the Captain's Log.

214
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,792
Let's go over them
one by one, shall we?

215
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,667
The Captain's Log?

216
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,333
Yes.

217
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,750
(<i> beeping</i> )

218
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,417
To the best of your knowledge,

219
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,917
has the Captain ever
falsified a log?

220
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,709
Have you discussed this
with him?

221
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,667
Right now, I'm asking you.

222
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,333
If you want to discuss anything
about Captain Picard,

223
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,125
you bring him in here,
and you ask him, face-to-face.

224
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,667
You are required to answer
my questions, Mr. Riker,

225
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:02,375
unless you're trying
to cover something up!

226
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:10,875
(<i> grunts softly</i> )

227
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:15,208
Now... there are
several discrepancies

228
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,709
in the Captain's Log.

229
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,041
Shall we go over them
one by one?

230
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,625
Proceed.

231
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,250
REMMICK:
So, you are saying
Captain Picard had

232
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,834
no control over
this vessel.

233
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,542
He handed it over
to Kosinski

234
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,917
who took the
entire crew

235
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:37,250
to the edge
of the universe.

236
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,208
No, sir,
that's not what I'm saying.

237
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,625
Now, Kosinski was sent here
by Starfleet

238
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,208
to improve
our warp drive system.

239
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,208
Captain Picard was ordered
to take him aboard.

240
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,709
According to his own logs,

241
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,875
his bridge crew
didn't think highly

242
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,500
of Mr. Kosinski's
theories.

243
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:53,333
Yet, the Captain allowed him
to access the engines anyway.

244
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,834
Is that true, La Forge?

245
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,917
Not exactly, sir.

246
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,041
One way or the other,
La Forge,

247
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,458
Picard lost control
of this ship.

248
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,750
Is that true?

249
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,166
Well, yes, but that's not
how it happened.

250
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,542
So...
the answer is yes.

251
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,125
(<i> beeping</i> )

252
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,959
(<i> sighs</i> )

253
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,083
Do you believe the captain
is emotionally

254
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,625
and psychologically fit

255
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,291
for command of
this starship?

256
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,375
There's nothing in his
history or personality

257
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:19,291
that would
suggest, uh...

258
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,625
mental lapses?

259
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:22,166
Nothing.

260
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,834
Not even
the Ferengi incident

261
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,250
aboard his old starship,
the<i> Stargazer?</i>

262
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:30,834
He was being controlled

263
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,500
by a mind-altering
machine, Commander...

264
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,208
without his knowledge!

265
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,208
I would call that
"a mental lapse."

266
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,583
(<i> beeping</i> )

267
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,333
Ensign.

268
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,166
What are you doing
on the holodeck?

269
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,291
I thought you were
still on Relva VII.

270
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,125
I'm finished testing
for the day.

271
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,625
I've disturbed you.
I'll leave.

272
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,583
Wait.

273
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,000
I thought
I wanted to be alone.

274
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,125
I guess I don't.

275
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,583
How is the testing?

276
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,417
Okay, so far.

277
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,917
It's not the ones
that I've studied for

278
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,250
that I'm worried about.

279
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,000
It's the psych test--

280
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,750
facing my deepest fear
and living through it.

281
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:27,834
I'm trying to
figure out

282
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,041
what images
to bring up.

283
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,458
Why?

284
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,834
Guess I want
to scare myself.

285
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,000
What do you think?
Bulgallian rats?

286
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,667
Lightning storms?

287
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:41,625
Do those things
frighten you?

288
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,834
Sort of, I guess.

289
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,291
The psych test is
no more or less important

290
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,667
than the rest
of the process.

291
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:49,125
That's what they said,

292
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,083
but I can't stop thinking
about it.

293
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,542
Thinking about what you
can't control only wastes energy

294
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,709
and creates its own enemy.

295
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,500
How can<i> they</i> know

296
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,750
what my deepest fear is
when<i> I</i> don't?

297
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:05,375
By analyzing
your psychological profile.

298
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:08,667
They were very accurate
about everyone I tested with.

299
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,583
Including myself.

300
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,583
You?

301
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,417
I thought there was nothing
that could frighten

302
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,458
a Klingon warrior.

303
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,667
Only fools have no fear.

304
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,667
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

305
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,333
I'm asking
too many personal questions.

306
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:29,166
It is very difficult for me

307
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,875
to depend on anyone
for anything...

308
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,959
...but especially for my life.

309
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,375
But on the<i> Enterprise,</i>
you do that every day.

310
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:42,417
Everyone depends on
everyone else to
protect them.

311
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,583
Yes.

312
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,792
So you overcame it?

313
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:48,208
No. It is still my enemy.

314
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,041
RIKER:
With this new
extricator, sir,

315
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,458
we could eliminate
three more bulky machines

316
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,625
from cargo space.

317
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:54,834
That's excellent,
Number One.

318
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:55,875
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

319
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,333
Captain?

320
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,458
There's
an unauthorized entry

321
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,542
in main shuttle bay.

322
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,834
Unauthorized?

323
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,333
Who is it,
Lieutenant?

324
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,542

of Jake Kurland.

Mr. Kurland, this

Respond.

327
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,208
Isn't that area secured?

328
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,709
Not now, Remmick.

329
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,500
He's going to take
this out, Captain.

330
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,208
YAR:
I'm locking off bay
launch doors, Captain.

331
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,208
Too late. He's using
the flight emergency override.

332
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,750
Smart kid.

333
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,792
Kid?
He's launching.

Mr. Kurland?

Tell my father I...

342
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,250
I'm sorry.

343
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,542
You can tell him
yourself, in person.

344
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,000
Bring that ship
back, at once.

345
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,166
No. I can't face him.

346
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,500
I'm leaving.

347

Captain, he's unbalanced
the dilithium reaction.

00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,083
I've lost power.

351
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,041
All he's got left is
his maneuvering jets, Captain.

352
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,667
At this trajectory,
he'll enter the atmosphere

353
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,625
and burn up at an altitude
of 200 kilometers.

354
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,000
Probable impact?

355
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,166

Not possible.

358
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,375
He's too far away
for a positive lock.

359
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,125
He's out of transporter range.

00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,083
Captain, you are
completely responsible

361
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,667
for that boy's life.

362
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,875
Mr. Remmick, either get
out of my way and keep quiet

363
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:35,625
or I will have you removed
from the bridge.

364
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,250
Viewer on shuttle cockpit.

365
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,291
Visual
on main viewer.

366
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,417
Mr. Kurland?

367
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,834
I can't get the engine
started.

368
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,417
What am I going to do?

369
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,083
I'm going to crash.

370
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,709
He needs
another 50 seconds

371
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,875
for the core to cool down
before he can restart.

372
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:55,458
Stay calm, Jake.

373
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,208
We'll get you back.

374
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,250
Please, help me.

375
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,667
PICARD:
Jake.

376
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:13,375
It's no use, Captain.

377
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm going to die out here.

378
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,959
He'll need another 30 seconds
before he can restart.

379
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,250
Irrelevant, sir.

380
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,667
Even if he restarts
his engine now,

381
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:21,917
he will not have enough
thrust to escape impact.

382
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,917
Mr. Kurland, you are not
going to die out there.

383
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,333
You are going to do
exactly what I tell you.

384
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,959
Now... take the nose
of the shuttlecraft

385
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,166
and aim it directly
at Relva VII.

386
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,500
But... aim it at Relva?

387
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,166
I-I can't do that.
That's crazy.

388
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,500
Do it!

389
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,709
But I'll burn up!

390
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,917
28 seconds to impact.

391
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,792
Jake, listen
very carefully.

392
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:47,792
This is Captain Picard,
and I am giving you an order.

393
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,667
Aim the shuttle at Relva.

394
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,625
(<i> thudding</i> )

395
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:00,166
Okay.
It's done.

396
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,500
Good.

397
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:04,000
Now, monitor
your speed exactly.

398
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,792
When it hits .020,

399
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,959
I want you
to restart the engine,

400
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,542
and when I tell you,
pull up hard.

401
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,542
.020 speed.

402
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,792
Captain, I...
I sure hope you're right.

403
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:21,083
You'll just have
to trust me.

404
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,875
.003...

405
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,834
.009...

406
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,959
.012.

407
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,542
Six seconds to impact.

408
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,834
Hold on, Jake,
it's going to be a little bumpy.

409
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,125
.015...

410
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,417
.019.

411
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,000
Restart the engine, now.

412
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,542
(<i> engine revving</i> )

413
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,417
Pull up hard!

414
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,291
(<i> loud clattering</i> )

415
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,792
(<i> metallic screeching</i> )

416
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,709
Yeah!

417
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,166
Incredible, Captain.

418
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,875
How did he do it?
I-I thought...

419
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,375
He built up
enough speed and then

420
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:07,166
bounced her off
the atmosphere.

421
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:10,542
Mr. Kurland?

422
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,458
I assume you can
maneuver it home.

423
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,750
Yes, sir.

424
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:17,000
Do it. Then report
to Mr. Riker.

425
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,792
Yes, sir.

426
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,458
Very original, Captain.

427
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,125
But how did that child acquire
access to a shuttlecraft?

428
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,583
Kurland is a
highly qualified

429
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,917
<i>Enterprise</i>
Academy candidate--

430
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,166
fully trained
in many areas

431
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,583
including shuttles.

432
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,375
Did this "full training"
include discipline?

433
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:38,583
Mr. Remmick,

434
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,500
young men sometimes
make rash choices

435
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:45,041
which is why Mr. Kurland
will receive a strong refresher

436
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,542
specifically in discipline.

437
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,709
I'll note that
in my report.

438
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,583
Mm... full cooperation,
Number One.

439
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,625
(<i> beeping</i> )

440
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,417
You! I have a package
for Operations.

441
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,792
Where is it?

442
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:13,417
End of the corridor,
room on your right. 104.

443
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,417
Excuse me.

444
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,500
You blocked my path.

445
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:19,834
You Bulgallian
sludge rat!

446
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,041
I'm sorry.

447
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,834
It was
an honest mistake.

448
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,041
I apologize.

449
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,625
Is there a problem here,
gentlemen?

450
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,125
Uh, no, sir, I...

451
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,000
Look, how dare you?!

452
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,583
I am Rondon,
you despicable

453
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,041
Mellanoid
slime worm!

454
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,458
Liar!

455
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,667
Who do you think
you're bullying?!

456
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:38,875
You bumped into me!

457
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,125
It was<i> your</i> mistake!

458
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,333
<i>You</i> were at fault!

459
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,834
Do you want this
to become violent?

460
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:51,834
Friend...

461
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,333
I like you.

462
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,250
A very strange
reaction.

463
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:02,834
Not really.

464
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,709
When he raised his hand,
I saw that it was webbed--

465
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,083
the sign of a Zaldan.

466
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,875
But<i> you</i> became hostile.

467
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:12,041
Zaldans are infuriated
by courtesy.

468
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,917
They view it as a form
of phony social behavior

469
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,542
designed to cover
true feelings.

470
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,875
Congratulations, Mr. Crusher.

471
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:23,625
You handled that
particular instant very well.

472
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:26,125
Was this incident deliberate?

473
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:29,250
It's important to know
how you candidates

474
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,250
deal with other cultures,

475
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,875
other species.

476
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:35,125
Then it was a test.

477
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,291
Yes.

478
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,041
Not all tests are
announced

479
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,417
or what
they appear to be.

480
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,542
Zaldans have webbed fingers.

481
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:54,417
I wouldn't have passed.

482
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,542
You're an android,
correct?

483
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,125
Yes, sir.
And as an android,

484
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,834
you are programmed to
tell the entire truth?

485
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,709
Yes, sir.

486
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,291
There is a problem with
this ship, Mr. Data.

487
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,875
It's in the records.

488
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,834
Somewhere.

489
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,667
I need your help
to find it.

490
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:19,125
All of the ship's records
are available to you, sir.

491
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:23,500
But this information
is very cleverly hidden.

492
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:26,875
Your captain is not
what he appears to be.

493
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:29,333
Do not forget that you
have loyalty to Starfleet

494
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,709
above all else.

495
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,917
Loyalty is not
the issue, Commander.

496
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,667
There is nothing wrong
with Captain Picard

497
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,250
or the ship's logs.

498
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,750
Therefore, there must be
something wrong

499
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,166
with your
original assumption.

500
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:44,333
That is not acceptable,
Mr. Data.

501
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:47,500
Acceptable or not, sir...

502
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:49,083
it is the truth.

503
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,709
Just how did
this contaminate

504
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,291
get aboard the ship?

505
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,709
(<i> beep</i> )

506
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,417
By accident, sir.

507
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,542
Meaning Captain Picard

508
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:06,125
has no standing procedure
for this type of situation?

509
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,250
No.

510
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:10,333
Meaning by<i> accident...</i> sir.

511
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,583
You don't like me
very much, do you?

512
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:16,875
Is it required, sir?

513
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:23,959
How would you characterize

514
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,375
your relationship
with Captain Picard?

515
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:29,834
We're Starfleet officers

516
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,667
who've known each other
for many years.

517
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:36,709
Everything said here
is confidential, Doctor.

518
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,041
You can be completely
open with me.

519
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,083
About what?

520
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,417
About how you feel
serving with the man...

521
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,041
who is responsible

522
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,792
for the death
of your husband.

523
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:54,458
(<i> chuckles softly</i> )

524
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:03,375
My personal feelings
about Captain Picard

525
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:06,542
are irrelevant
to this investigation

526
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:10,709
and none of your business.

527
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,375
Then you confirm
the accuracy of the log report?

528
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:17,375
You violated the Prime Directive
of the Edo.

529
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:20,583
You deliberately
interfered with their laws.

530
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,250
Yes. It is exactly
as I explained it

531
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,792
in the log records.

532
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:28,333
All to save
Dr. Crusher's son.

533
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:31,291
A member of my crew was
being held unjustly.

534
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,875
I stand by my decision.

535
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,375
(<i> beep</i> )

536
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:40,583
Mr. Remmick, you've talked
to every member of this ship.

537
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:42,375
I think you've had
enough time to find out

538
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,000
whatever it is
you're looking for.

539
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,667
Are you afraid
if I keep looking,

540
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:47,750
I'll find that you're guilty?

541
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,458
The only thing
I'm guilty of

542
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,291
is allowing this charade
to go on so long.

543
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,542
Admiral, if it is me
you're investigating,

544
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:13,250
ask me directly what
it is you want to know.

545
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:16,667
And please tell me
exactly what is going on.

546
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:18,500
I need a little more time,
Jean-Luc.

547
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:20,083
How much time?

548
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,583
I won't tolerate my crew
being harassed any longer.

549
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:25,291
Remmick's full report
is almost ready.

550
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,709
I want to be here
when he presents it.

551
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,917
That has always
been my intention.

552
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,875
Commander Remmick,
report to Admiral Quinn.

553
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:37,208
On my way, sir.

554
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,583
This has been a strain
on our friendship.

555
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,000
I know.

556
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:44,583
Believe me, Jean-Luc,
I regret that.

557
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:48,208
But it has been necessary.

558
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,625
(<i> rhythmic computer beeping</i> )

559
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:01,208
(<i> high-pitched chirping</i> )

560
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:18,291
I can't get it.

561
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,709
Yes, you can.

562
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,750
Don't fight it.

563
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:24,500
Relax into it,
and let it come by itself.

564
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:26,500
No, it's going too fast.

565
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,917
Wesley, I can't do it.

566
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,333
Yes, you can.

567
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,750
You've got your
rotation factor.

568
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:35,333
Just put in
your vector coordinates.

569
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:55,000
COMPUTER:
Time elapsed.

570
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,875
(<i> door opens</i> )

571
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,625
Congratulations, Mordock.

572
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:03,709
That was the second
fastest time

573
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,000
ever recorded on this test.

574
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:07,375
You all did well.

575
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:08,583
MORDOCK:
No.

576
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:11,000
It should not have been
that way.

577
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,250
Mr. Crusher helped me.

578
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:15,458
Yes, I know.

579
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,333
An interesting choice,
Mr. Crusher--

580
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:21,667
especially considering how close
you and Mr. Mordock are

581
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:23,208
in overall score.

582
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,667
You all have an hour

583
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:28,041
to prepare for your last test.

584
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,500
WESLEY:
The psych test, sir?

585
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,250
We prefer to think of it
as a psychological evaluation

586
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:39,959
based on reactions to various
individual problems,

587
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,583
but, uh,
"psych test" will do.

588
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,792
Sir?

589
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,500
Please sit down,
Mr. Remmick.

590
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,625
Proceed with your report.

591
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,750
Admiral, I've done
my best to be thorough

592
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:08,417
during this
investigation.

593
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,125
Continue.

594
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:12,291
I couldn't find
what you asked for, sir.

595
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:16,333
I spoke to officer
after officer,

596
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,208
a-at length, I...

597
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,792
pried into
the ship's logs,

598
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,959
and yet I could find
nothing wrong--

599
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
except, perhaps a...

600
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:26,458
casual familiarity
among the bridge crew,

601
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,333
but mostly that comes from
a sense of teamwork...

602
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,667
...and a feeling of family.

603
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,250
I'm sorry, sir.

604
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:40,875
I did my best.

605
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:42,417
Quite.

606
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,750
You're dismissed,
Commander.

607
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,125
Yes, sir.

608
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:53,000
Captain Picard.

609
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:57,834
My tour in the Inspector
General's office

610
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,959
will be up in six months.

611
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,166
When I'm finished...

612
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,458
this is where
I'd like to serve, sir.

613
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,166
Don't judge the young man
too harshly.

614
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,542
He's a good officer.

615
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,500
It's not him I'm
inclined to judge.

616
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,542
Don't judge me
too harshly, either,

617
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,125
until I've finished.

618
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:29,083
We had to be
very sure of you.

619
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,291
Some of us
at Starfleet Command

620
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:35,625
became suspicious of certain
problems in the Federation.

621
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,041
What kind of problems?

622
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,125
Someone or something
is trying to destroy

623
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:40,500
the fabric
of everything

624
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:43,792
we've built up
in the last 200 years.

625
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:44,834
What's your evidence?

626
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,166
I can't go into that.

627
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,333
There are
too many people involved.

628
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,125
What do you want from me?

629
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:52,959
I don't know whether the threat
comes from the inside,

630
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,750
or whether it's from outside.

631
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:57,834
I need people I can trust

632
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,083
in strong positions
throughout the Federation.

633
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,125
You have my complete
support, you know that.

634
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:04,250
That's not enough.

635
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,375
I want to promote you
to admiral,

636
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:11,000
and I want you to take over as
commandant of Starfleet Academy.

637
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:14,000
The Academy?

638
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:15,333
Yes.

639
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:25,959
The Academy?

640
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,083
I need you close.

641
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:32,291
Then there was<i> never</i> a problem
with the<i> Enterprise.</i>

642
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,208
No.

643
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,041
But I had to be sure
you hadn't been co-opted.

644
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,083
(<i> snickers</i> )

645
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,250
Then, Greg, uh...

646
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,875
this is...

647
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:46,667
politics,
and, uh...

648
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:47,917
(<i> sighs heavily</i> )

649
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,625
...I, uh...

650
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,792
I'm not good
at politics.

651
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:55,000
Surely there are others
who are better suited.

652
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,417
All right.

653
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:59,041
Even if I am wrong,
and I hope I am,

654
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,875
you're still the best man
for the job.

655
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:03,667
I appreciate the value
of what you're offering.

656
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,500
It's not a decision
I can make quickly.

657
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,625
I need an answer soon.

658
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,667
All right.

659
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:15,917
You'll have it tonight,
Admiral.

660
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,000
Thank you.

661
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:38,750
Mr. Mordock will be finished
with his psych test momentarily.

662
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,834
WESLEY:
Mordock?

663
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,333
Are you all right?

664
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,583
I will be.

665
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:57,500
Mr. Crusher.

666
00:33:57,542 --> 00:33:59,709
You're next.

667
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,417
Good luck.

668
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,500
I'm here.

669
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,667
I'm ready.

670
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,458
Maybe they forgot.

671
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,709
Breathe.

672
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,667
Got to remember to breathe.

673
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:55,291

Come on!
If we don't get
out of here fast,

700
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:13,792
they'll seal us in
to contain the explosion.

701

Come on!

00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:16,417
You're not hurt!

00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,333
I can't move through that!

704
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,125
Yes, you can!

Wesley!

718
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,959
It's all right.

719
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:01,000
Thanks.

720
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:05,709
An excellent performance,
Mr. Crusher.

721
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,500
Performance?

722
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:15,959
That was the test.

723
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,333
Yes.

724
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:20,500
A man could have died.

725
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:22,125
Theoretically, yes.

726
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,500
You had to make
a choice, and you did.

727
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,333
There's no right or wrong
about it.

728
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:30,875
Your greatest fear has been that
you couldn't make that decision.

729
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,792
Because of my father?
Because Capt...

730
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:40,834
Because someone made
that choice...

731
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,917
and my father died.

732
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,500
Sir?

733
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:03,083
Yes, Number One?

734
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,417
Mr. Remmick
has left the ship.

735
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:07,208
Yes.

736
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,625
He found nothing wrong
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

737
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,291
And you can inform the crew

738
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,834
that Admiral Quinn
is most impressed.

739
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,125
Thank you.

740
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:18,041
They'll be pleased to hear that.

741
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,792
Can you explain now
what he was after?

742
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:22,417
They were after me,
Number One.

743
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:24,083
They want me
to take over

744
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:27,250
as commandant,
Starfleet Academy.

745
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:29,583
Congratulations.

746
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,250
What a wonderful choice, sir.

747
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:32,583
You'll be able
to shape the minds

748
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,667
of the future leaders
of Starfleet.

749
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:41,417
You haven't decided
what you're going to do.

750
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,750
Yes, I have, Number One.

751
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:45,917
I've decided
I'm going for a walk.

752
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:50,709
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

753
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,417
I'm proud of all of you.

754
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:58,625
You've done
a superb job.

755
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:00,583
Each of you would make

756
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:03,166
a fine
Starfleet officer.

757
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,834
It's unfair that only
one candidate from Relva

758
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,083
will attend the Academy
this year...

759
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:10,542
and a loss
to the Federation

760
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:14,417
if the rest of you do not
return to test again.

761
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,291
Mr. Mordock will be
the candidate.

762
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,125
His results were
slightly higher

763
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:21,959
than Mr. Crusher's.

764
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,125
Congratulations,
Mr. Mordock.

765
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:27,125
You're the first Benzite
in Starfleet.

766
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:29,625
Thank you, sir,
but it's not right.

767
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,709
It shouldn't be me.

768
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,291
Wesley lost points
because he helped me.

769
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,709
He should not be punished
for his generosity.

770
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,083
He wasn't.

771
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,875
He lost time,
but it wasn't only that.

772
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:43,583
Candidates, thank you.

773
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,500
And good luck.

774
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:54,375
I am sorry, Wesley.

775
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:57,709
It's okay. You
deserve to win.

776
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,917
Besides, you would have
done the same for me.

777
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:07,250
Yes. I believe I would.

778
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:08,917
Congratulations.

779
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:15,792
Well, personally,
I hate losing.

780
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:17,875
So you'd better be ready
next year, Wesley.

781
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,542
I won't be
easy to beat.

782
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:38,500
Mr. Kurland.

783
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:42,875
Yes, sir.

784
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:47,125
Are you, uh...

785
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,917
feeling better?

786
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,375
Yes, sir.

787
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:52,667
Look, I-I'm sorry

788
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:55,166
I-I damaged
the shuttle, Captain.

789
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,834
But Mr. Riker said
I can work on fixing it

790
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,792
as part of my
discipline training.

791
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:00,333
Good idea. I hope
you've learned

792
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,375
that running away
solves nothing.

793
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:05,500
Oh, yes, sir.

794
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:08,291
And I-I am sorry
I messed up.

795
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,166
But at least
you kept your wits
about you out there.

796
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:12,542
Don't forget that.

797
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:15,083
No, sir.

798
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:17,542
And thank you.

799
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:20,083
Thank you for-for...

800
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,875
for saving my life.

801
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:24,208
That's my job,
young man.

802
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,250
Yes, sir.

803
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:46,375
Mr. Crusher?

804
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:47,750
Why aren't you in
your dress uniform

805
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:49,542
for Admiral Quinn's
farewell dinner?

806
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:55,625
I didn't think that would be
appropriate, sir.

807
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:57,959
Why not?

808
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,041
I failed, Captain.

809
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,291
I didn't get into
the Academy.

810
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:06,959
I failed you,
and I failed the<i> Enterprise.</i>

811
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,875
Ridiculous.

812
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,291
Did you do your best?

813
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:16,333
Yes.

814
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:17,834
When you test
next year--

815
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,500
and you will
test next year--

816
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:21,291
do you think your
performance will improve?

817
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,875
Yes.

818
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,208
Good.

819
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:29,000
The only person you are truly
competing against, Wesley,

820
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:30,375
is yourself.

821
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:33,417
Then you're not
disappointed?

822
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:40,542
Wesley,
you have to measure

823
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:44,125
your successes and
your failures within--

824
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:47,625
not by anything
that I or anyone
else might think.

825
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:50,917
But, um...

826
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:54,917
if it helps you
to know this...

827
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:56,375
I failed
the first time,

828
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:59,166
and you may not
tell anyone.

829
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:01,583
You?!

830
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:02,667
You failed?

831
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:05,166
Yes, but not
the second time.

832
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,625
Now...

833
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:11,208
you, uh, do me
the courtesy

834
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,917
of joining us
at dinner.

835
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:16,417
I have to disappoint
an old friend.

836
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,208
Wish I could convince you
to change your mind.

837
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,291
I'll serve you
better here.

838
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:33,625
This is where
you belong.

839
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:34,834
If you should
need me...

840
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:37,083
I've been playing
politics too long.

841
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:40,625
Perhaps I see
conspiracies everywhere.

842
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:42,250
Don't worry.

843
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:47,583
Safe travels, my friend.

844
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:06,583
Set course for Algeron IV,
Mr. Crusher.

845
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:09,750
(<i> beeping</i> )

846
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:13,000
Course plotted
and laid in, sir.

847
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:15,166
Then shall we continue
with our mission?

848
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:19,208
Yes, sir.

849
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,959
Excellent.

850
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:26,625
Mr. Crusher...

851
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,458
engage.
