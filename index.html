  <h1>Linked TV Transcripts</h1>
  <h4>About</h4>
  <p>
    This site contains transcripts for some TV shows with links to each
    timestamp in Netflix. This allows you search for a particular line
    and then start watching an episode from that scene.
  </p>
  <h4>Shows</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><a href='atla'>Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></li>
    <li><a href='lok'>The Legend of Korra</a></li>
    <li><a href='ds9'>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>FAQ</h4>
  <b>Can you add my favorite show here?</b>
  <p>
    I only really plan to add shows I personally watch here, but if it's a
    particularly popular show (especially a very quotable one), there's a
    good chance I'll get to it eventually. I'll add instructions for how to
    get all the necessary files for a show soon, and then anyone can submit a
    pull request to add one.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <b>Why do the episode numbers not match Netflix's?</b>
  <p>
    Netflix numbers episodes sequentially, but they sometimes combine multiple
    episodes into one. For my numbering here, I give the combined episode the
    episode number that its first part would have, and then skip the numbers
    that subsequent parts would have if they were separate.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <b>Will this site work if I'm outside the US?</b>
  <p>
    If a show on this site isn't available on your country's Netflix, it
    definitely won't work. I think it's also possible that some shows may have
    separate listings in some countries, which could also break these links for
    you.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <b>Why is the timing on this link wrong?</b>
  <p>
    There are a few possible culprits. For one, if you link too late into an
    episode (usually the last few minutes), Netflix ignores the timestamp and
    just starts the episode from the beginning.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's also possible that the subtitles are out of sync with Netflix's video.
    For shows like Avatar, where Netflix's video differs from all the home media
    releases (they added a "previously on" segment to episodes that didn't have
    one on the DVDs), I ripped the subtitles directly from Netflix, so the match
    should be exact, but for shows where Netflix's video generally matches the
    DVDs/Blu-rays I used existing SRT files.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was less tedious for me, but it does mean there may be sync issues.
    Sometimes this can be fixed with a constant offset, but other times the best
    solution is just to rip Netflix's subtitles instead. Note: Netflix's *own*
    subtitles can sometimes be incorrect, so using them doesn't guarantee good
    timings.
