  <h1>Linked TV Transcripts</h1>
  <h4>About</h4>
  <p>
    This site contains transcripts for some TV shows with links to each
    timestamp in Netflix. This allows you search for a particular line
    and then start watching an episode from that scene.
  </p>
  <h4>Shows</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><a href='atla'>Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></li>
  <li><a href='bojack'>BoJack Horseman</a></li>
  <li><a href='derry'>Derry Girls</a></li>

  </ul>
  <h4>FAQ</h4>
  <b>Can you add my favorite show here?</b>
  <p>
    I only really plan to add shows I personally watch here, but I'll try to
    add instructions soon for generating the necessary files so that anyone
    can submit a pull request adding a new show.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <b>Why do the episode numbers not match Netflix's?</b>
  <p>
    Netflix numbers episodes sequentially, but they sometimes combine multiple
    episodes into one. For my numbering here, I give the combined episode the
    episode number that its first part would have, and then skip the numbers
    that subsequent parts would have if they were separate.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <b>Will this site work if I'm outside the US?</b>
  <p>
    If a show on this site isn't available on your country's Netflix, it
    definitely won't work. I think it's also possible that some shows may have
    separate listings in some countries, which could also break these links for
    you.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <b>Why did the link jump to the beginning of the episode?</b>
  <p>
    For some reason, if you link to a timestamp too late in an episode, Netflix
    decides to ignore it and start from the beginning.
